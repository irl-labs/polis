<details><summary>Please, summarize the Select Board meeting.</summary>

> The Select Board meeting began with a moment of silence in honor of the late Charlie Lyons, a former member of the board and a significant contributor to the community. The board then discussed a complaint made under the open meeting law, concluding that the complaint was not relevant to the law. The board appointed Jim DiTullio to the Artificial Turf Study Committee, praising his expertise in environmental protection and his commitment to the town. The board also discussed the success of the recent town day, thanking staff for their hard work and expressing relief that the weather held up. The board also discussed the senior parking sticker program, the new coach of the Arlington High football team, and the overnight parking pilot. The meeting concluded with the board agreeing to adjourn.
</details><details><summary>What is the board's official response to the open meeting law complaint by Corey Spaulding.</summary>

> The board's official response to the open meeting law complaint by Corey Spaulding, as summarized by the Chair and Attorney Heim, is that the complaint is not really an open meeting law complaint. The complaint was about not putting a specific item on the agenda, which is not relevant to open meeting law. The second point is that the chair of any body is not obligated to put an item on the agenda. The board does not have to put any matter on its agenda or discuss anything. It can have an open forum, and when it does so, it's obligated to let people essentially say their piece, but it's also having a business meeting. The purpose is to get through the agenda items that the board wants to attend to.

> 1. Sanjeev, a resident of 10 Oldham Road, spoke in favor of the betterment. He highlighted the poor condition of the road, including large potholes, and the safety issues this presents for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers. He also noted that the majority of residents are in favor of the road work and are willing to pay upfront for it.

2. Sean Lyons, a resident of 22 Oldham Road, spoke against the betterment. He expressed concerns that repaving the road would turn it into a highway and disrupt the quiet nature of the neighborhood. He also suggested that utility work should be completed before any road work and requested that the project be postponed until spring.

3. Kathy Lyons, also a resident of 22 Oldham Road, questioned why certain houses were being excluded from the betterment. She argued that the cost should be shared by all residents of the street, not just a select few.

4. Dan and Terry Shine, residents of 23 Oldham Road, thanked Ms. Cantor for her work on the project. They expressed a preference for the original proposal to do the street up to Country Club Lane and questioned why the board was not voting on this proposal.

5. Richard Quartz, a resident of 9 Oldham Road, spoke in favor of the betterment. He agreed with his neighbors about the poor state of the street and described it as very dangerous. He expressed his hope that the road would be paved as soon as possible.
</details><details><summary>Summarize Sean Lyon's opposition to the betterment of Oldham Road.</summary>

> Sean Lyons, a resident of 22 Oldham Road, expressed several reasons for his opposition to the betterment of Oldham Road. Firstly, he was concerned that improving the street would turn it into a highway, increasing traffic and noise. He also argued that the road's current condition, while not perfect, was comparable to other prestigious areas and served to slow down traffic. Lyons also expressed dissatisfaction with the process, stating that he felt there had been insufficient communication and consultation with residents. He suggested that if the road was to be improved, it should be done in its entirety rather than in sections, and that residents should be given the opportunity to bring in utilities and make other improvements first. He also proposed that the work be postponed until spring to allow for these preparations.
</details><details><summary>Summarize the discussion about No Parking signs on West Street.  What was the board's vote?</summary>

</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the Fossil Fuel Free warrant article presentation and discussion.</summary>

> The Fossil Fuel Free warrant article presentation was led by Talia Fox, the Sustainability Manager for the Town of Arlington, and Amos Meeks, a member of the Clean Energy Future Committee. They presented an updated bylaw that aims to restrict and prohibit new building construction and major renovation projects that are not fossil fuel free. The updated bylaw aligns with the Department of Energy Resources' model rule and includes references to the specialized stretch energy code. It also redefines major renovation to align square footage thresholds with the specialized code and model rule. The bylaw removes the exemption for indoor cooking appliances, introduces a new square footage threshold for the exemption for multifamily building domestic hot water, and changes the effective date of the bylaw to three months following DOER approval. The Select Board unanimously supported the motion for the updated bylaw.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Amos Meeks' presentation concerning the Fossil Fuel Free warrant article.</summary>

> Amos Meeks, a member of the Clean Energy Future Committee, presented on the Fossil Fuel Free warrant article. He explained that the article is part of the town's net zero action plan, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The strategy involves electrifying everything as much as possible while simultaneously cleaning the grid. The warrant article 14 specifically proposes to amend the town bylaws to restrict and prohibit new building construction and major renovation projects that are not fossil fuel free. Meeks emphasized that the goal is to stop building new structures that will later need costly renovations to become fossil fuel free. He also mentioned that Arlington has already taken action on this priority, with 92% of town meeting members voting to enact the Clean Heat Bylaw in 2020.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Talia Fox's presentation concerning the Fossil Fuel Free warrant article.</summary>

> Talia Fox, the Sustainability Manager for the Town of Arlington, presented on the Fossil Fuel Free warrant article. The proposed updates to the 2020 Clean Heat Bylaw aim to align with the Department of Energy Resources' (DOER) model rule and advances in technology and policy. The updated bylaw's enforcement framework for new construction references the specialized code by eliminating pathways in the specialized code that allow the use of fossil fuels. The bylaw redefines major renovation to align square footage thresholds with the specialized code and DOER model rule. The exemption for indoor cooking appliances has been removed due to the negative impacts on human health. The bylaw contains a new square footage threshold for the exemption for multifamily building domestic hot water. The effective date of the bylaw has been changed to three months following DOER approval. The bylaw would apply to new homes, major renovations, new commercial buildings, and commercial major renovation projects.
