> The Arlington Select Board Meeting, chaired by Eric Helmuth, was conducted in a hybrid format due to COVID-19 measures. The meeting discussed the approval of the minutes of the previous meeting, approval of the Arlington Open Studios lawn signs, and a request for a special one-day beer and wine license.

> The Battle of Menotomy, also known as the Battle of Lexington and Concord, took place on April 19, 1775, and marked the start of the American Revolutionary War. On that day, British troops marched from Boston to Concord, Massachusetts, with the aim of seizing an arms cache. On their way, at Lexington, they encountered a small contingent of American militiamen. No one knows which side fired the first shot, but it sparked a battle that led to a full day of fighting. After the initial skirmish at Lexington, the British troops continued to Concord where they searched for the weapons cache. They were confronted by a larger force of American militiamen and were forced to retreat. The fighting continued all the way back to Boston, with American militiamen firing on the British from behind trees, stone walls, and buildings in the area known as Menotomy, now Arlington. The British suffered significant casualties during their retreat. The battle demonstrated the willingness and ability of the colonists to fight, marking a point of no return in the struggle for independence.
