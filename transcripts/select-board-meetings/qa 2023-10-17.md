<details><summary>Please, summarize the Select Board meeting.</summary>

> The Arlington Select Board meeting, chaired by Eric Helmuth, was conducted in a hybrid format on October 17th. The meeting was held in the Select Board Chambers and over Zoom, and was broadcast on ACMI. The board discussed a typographical error on the ballot language for Question 1 on November 7th, which incorrectly stated the fiscal year in which the override would take effect. Instead of delaying the election to correct the language, the board decided to proceed with the current language after consulting with the town manager and his finance team. The board also discussed making two small changes to the overrides for clarity. The board unanimously voted to make the suggested edits and to support Helmuth's previous comments on behalf of the board. The meeting concluded with the board moving into an executive session to discuss impending litigation.

> The Select Board's Override Commitments refer to the board's financial plans and commitments to taxpayers in the event of a successful override vote. The board had initially planned for the override to take effect in fiscal year 24, but due to a typographical error on the ballot, the override would take effect in fiscal year 25. Despite this, the board, led by Chair Eric Helmuth, decided to proceed with the current language and reassured that they could still meet all commitments to taxpayers, including maintaining level services in the town and schools, making specific new investments, and not asking for another override before fiscal 27. The board also proposed two small changes to the override commitments for clarity and updated the effective date. The board's decision was supported by recent positive financial developments and the town's conservative budgeting practices.

> The Finance Committee took a no-action vote for Article 2 due to a typographical error discovered on the ballot language for Question 1 on November 7th. The error specified that the tax increase, if approved by voters, would take effect in July 2024, not in winter and spring as originally planned. This meant that the town would ask voters for $7 million less between now and the end of fiscal year 26. After consulting with the town manager and his finance team, it was decided that the town could proceed with the current language and still meet all the Select Board commitments to taxpayers for this override. Therefore, the Finance Committee decided to take no action on Article 2.

> 1. Eric Helmuth: As the Select Board Chair, Helmuth led the meeting and explained the situation regarding the override commitments. He suggested two small changes to the commitments for clarity and detailed the reasons behind them. He also invited discussion and elaboration from the town manager and other board members.

2. Mr. Diggins: Diggins asked about the financial impact of the current situation versus what would have happened otherwise. He wanted to understand the options and their implications on the long-range plan.

3. Mrs. Mahan: Mahan moved approval of the revised Select Board Override Commitment Sheet statement and expressed her agreement with the course of action. She also requested a report on the override stabilization fund balance and emphasized the need to address pay disparities for teachers, paraprofessionals, and department heads.

4. Mr. Hurd: Hurd seconded Mahan's motion and expressed his support for the revised commitments. He praised the town's financial management and believed that the situation, despite the typo, proved the town's commitment to operating on a lean budget while still providing excellent services.

5. Mr. DeCorsi: DeCorsi thanked Helmuth for his leadership and expressed his support for Mahan's motion. He highlighted the recent financial developments that assisted in the analysis and believed that the deferral of funds until the next fiscal year made a stronger argument for the override.
