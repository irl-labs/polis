<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 635</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. I'm calling to order this meeting of the Arlington Select Board on Wednesday, February the 21st, 2024. I am Select Board Chair Eric Helmuth. I will now confirm that all members and persons anticipated on the agenda are present and can hear me, particularly the people who are remote. But I'll start with members. When I call your name, please respond in the affirmative. This will also serve as a sound check for our remote members. Diane Mahan. Affirmative. John Heard. Yes. Steve DeCoursey. Here. Len Diggins. You are loud and clear, Mr. Chair. Thank you, sir. Staff, when I call your name, please respond in the affirmative. Town Manager Jim Feeney. Here. And as Town Council Attorney Mike Cunningham joined us yet? Okay, so he'll join us when he's able. Select Board Administrator Ashley Marr. Here. Okay. I think that's everybody we need to do an A.V. check for. So as you can see, tonight's meeting is being conducted in a hybrid format consistent with Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023 signed into law on March 29th, 2023, which further extends certain COVID-19 measures regarding remote participation in public meetings until March 31st, 2025. Before we begin, please note the following. First, this meeting is being conducted in the Select Board Chambers and over Zoom. It is being recorded and simultaneously broadcasted on ACMI. Second, people wishing to join the meeting by Zoom may find information on how to do so on the Town's website. If you're participating by Zoom, you may be visible to others. If you wish to participate, we ask you to provide your full name in the interest of developing a record of the meeting. Same thing goes for people here in the room. Third, all participants are advised that people may be listening who do not provide comment and those persons are not asked to identify themselves. Both Zoom participants and persons watching on ACMI can follow the posted agenda materials found on the Town's website, specifically the Select Board Agendas and Minutes page. And finally, because one or more Select Board members are participating remotely and tonight that is two members, each vote tonight will be taken by roll call in accordance with statute. So let's see how much of a townspends we can get done tonight. A couple of notes for public comment and also a note on the hybrid nature of the meeting. As always, if we have problems with remote members or remote participants experiencing a disconnection, we will first attempt and allow some time to reconnect and hope that that happens. If after a sufficient number of attempts we can't do that, provided that we still have a quorum of the Select Board, which is the three members, we'll proceed with business as usual. Regarding public comment this evening, because we are entering into our season of warrant article hearings, it's a longstanding tradition and practice of the Board, and I think a wise one, that we reserve public comment for the warrant article hearings and any other legally mandated hearings, but we typically omit the open forum portion of the meetings during this season, and that's simply so that we can give the other public hearings, particularly the warrant articles, the attention that they deserve. If we have items where there will be public comment, I will announce those before the agenda, or before, when we get to that agenda item, and if you are on Zoom and you wish to comment at that time, I'll ask you to raise your hand in Zoom. If you're in the room, obviously you'll raise your hand here. If you do not know how to raise your hand in Zoom, now would be an excellent time to search for how to do that.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth on Corinne Rainville passing  - 84</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to begin this meeting with an observation of some very sad news. A former town clerk, Corinne Rainville, who served Arlington for 16 years, passed away last week. She died tragically in a house fire of her daughter up in Vermont, and I want to, on behalf of the board and the town, express our deepest condolences to her family, and I would invite board members to make any comments, after which we'll observe a moment of silence in Ms. Rainville's memory.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 347</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mahan? Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for doing that. As you said, we lost her tragically. So many people devastated Mrs. Rainville, Corinne's passing. A lot of people still in town hall had the opportunity to work with her, and she's someone that, Arlington-born, started as a principal clerk, worked her way up. She was the assistant town clerk for many years for my husband's aunt, Anne Mahan Powers, so she had some really great training, and as you mentioned, she served in that for 16 years, and then she came back and filled in as an interim, I think, in 2019 for several months during that transition, and again demonstrating her commitment to the town of Arlington, which was her second family. Her first family, of course, were her children, her two daughters, Carrie and Kristen. She talked about them all the time, and Corinne was really a very quiet, unassuming woman. However, when she was in her element and working down at the town clerk's office and conducting the business of Arlington through the town clerk's office, she was top of the mark in terms of not only the knowledge that she has had, but also one of the justice balance of the job of town clerk is dealing with the public department heads, municipal officials, and sometimes state officials, and I know you will not find one person that won't have anything but to say glowing and extremely positive remarks about any interaction with Corinne. So sad to hear of her passing. I know different people have on Facebook pages and others, there's a GoFundMe account for her daughters. I know I will miss her. I still kept in touch with her now and then. She still said to me, Diane, you're one of the funniest people I know, which I don't know if I was, but she was kind enough to say that, and I'm really, really going to miss her along with so many other people, and Godspeed, Corinne. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mrs. Mahan. Mr. Gorsy.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 116</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also want to express my condolences to Corinne's family, and I knew Corinne when I first became a town meeting member. She was a clerk, and it got to know her through her years at various meetings and at town meeting, and I'm very sorry about the loss. Thank you, sir. Any of my colleagues over Zoom want to make comments? Please just jump in. Thank you both very much. I think, as I said now, I'd like to invite everyone to pause for a moment and observe a moment of silence in gratitude for Corinne's life and to express our thoughts and prayers to her family. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 126</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening, because one of our members is on family vacation out of state, Mr. Hurd, and he, over and above the call of duty, joined the meeting tonight for one specific item that he is involved with, and so I'm going to take that item out of order and take that and do that now, and that is item 10, battle reenactment plans. So what I'd like to do is invite Deputy Town Manager Christine Bongiorno and our Economic Development Coordinator Katie Lucite to come speak with us, and I'll note that Mr. Hurd then will make some remarks afterwards. He is, of course, the Select Board Chair to the Arlington 250 Committee, and the connection of that will become very clear momentarily. Ms. Bongiorno.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Bongiorno - 451</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you so much for this opportunity. As you mentioned, I'm Christine Bongiorno, the Deputy Town Manager of Operations, and I have here Katie Lucite, our Economic Development Director here in town. As you know, the 250th anniversary of the American Revolution is coming up. It's next year. The board has established a committee. John Hurd and Angela Olszewski are the two co-chairs, so a significant amount of work has been done to date to plan for next year's events that are happening. Arlington is a member of a four-community process. We're basically joining forces with Lexington, Concord, and Lincoln, and we're partnering to make sure that our events and the different things that are happening that weekend are all coordinated. And so we're using this year, this April, as a dress rehearsal. All four communities are using this year as a dress rehearsal for next year. One of our big areas that we are planning for is a battle reenactment, and so our team, our committee, has been working closely with a group of battle reenactors to make this happen. So the battle reenactment will be taking place on Sunday, April 14th, and we're here tonight to just ask for your conditional approval to move this forward. Our team has been meeting, our emergency planning team, which includes the fire, police, DPW, has been meeting to look at the logistics of the plan that's been proposed, and we're working closely with the battle reenactors to just make sure that we're looking at all of the different safety concerns that we're able to appropriately staff and move people in and out of the community. So I asked for conditional approval to close Mass Ave. from Grove Street, Grove Prentice Street, all the way to Medford Street, while we work through the logistics with our emergency planning partners. I will just mention that Arlington isn't alone, as I mentioned before. We are working closely with Lexington, Concord, and Lincoln. We do have partners in those communities that are doing the same in looking at making sure we're evaluating all safety concerns and making sure that we're appropriately staffing our communities. I think, you know, at this point, I'd love to hear from John if he has anything else he would like to add. Yeah, absolutely. And let me just, I didn't write down, I'm sorry, the date again? It's Sunday, April 14th, and the closure will happen. We are looking tentatively, again, this is a conditional approval, based on the need for us to really continue to work through the logistics with our police, fire, and with the battle reenactor group. The closure would happen from 12 noon until 5 p.m.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 47</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. All right, so the request is a conditional approval of a closure of Mass Ave. from Grove Prentice to Medford, conditioned upon further work from the town officials, Sunday, April 14th, and 12 to 5. Okay, anything else from you before I turn to Mr. Hurd?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 70</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll just also add, in addition to just our local public safety officials, we've also been working with MEMA and the Boston Athletic Association, as well as FEMA. So there's a lot of different parties that have been working regionally, just to make sure that this is really going to be a very safe event, since this will be really one of the first major public events since the pandemic.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 6</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent. Thanks very much. Mr. Hurd.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 142</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to thank Christine and Katie for all the work they've been doing on this. It's really been a long process to get us to this point, and town staff has really gone above and beyond the call of duty to really put this together. It's an event like we haven't experienced in Arlington before. I think it will be a really great event for our residents and tourists. I'd like to move approval. Again, we're just asking for the outside parameters of what the event could be, and we're going to work with town officials and public safety officials to make sure that this event is safe and within the bounds of what works for the town. I would like to move approval, and again, thank everyone for all their work on this event.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 20</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much, Mr. Hurd. I will now turn to my colleagues for any second, and potentially any discussion.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 64</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. DeCorsi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I'll second Mr. Hurd's motion. I just want to clarify, I heard you say approval, Mr. Hurd, and Ms. Mangione had asked for a conditional approval. I know this thing's to be worked out just for purposes of the vote. Is that what your intention was? I just want to make sure I'm seconding the right motion.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 61</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, so conditional approval of, like I said, the outside parameters. What I think the board really needs to approve is the shutdown of the street from Grove Street to Memphis Street, subject to the approval of working with town officials to make sure that the event is safe and within the bounds of what is approved by the town staff.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 32</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, happy to support it, and thank you all for the work that you've been doing on this in advance of April 14th. Ms. Mahan.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 211</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all the hard work that's gone into this, and there's still a lot more that I know, many, many hours to coordinate something like this, even though it is sort of a prep for next year. It still is a big major event, and I just want to make sure I'm correct in my understanding. We're not talking about the parade. We're talking about a battle reenactment. Correct. And I understand Lexington conquered, and I don't know if another community is doing it, but when they have the reenactors, is it going to be a spot in each community, or is it going to start in one community and go down, go down past Foot of the Rocks? And then the other thing I would ask, just to put in, if it can't be done, that's fine. It may already be being discussed. If Lansome Way was somehow incorporated into that, because I think that was something that I really didn't know a lot about until the town organizers and Andrew Lozowski may also have been involved in that. So if you could just maybe just clarify a little bit, it's not a parade. It's a reenactment. Is it continuous? Something like that.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 161</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm happy to respond. Yeah, and thank you for bringing up the Lansome Way. I think that's a really big part of our history that needs to be addressed as well, so thank you. So Lexington conquered and Lincoln, we have decided to break down the weekend, and each community will have its own day. So Arlington's day is Sunday. We're doing many events that weekend. The battle reenactment just happens to fall on that Sunday, and that's the day that Arlington will run. So each day there will be a battle reenactment in each community. Yes, Lexington and Concord have their reenactments on Saturday. Those are happening in the morning separately. There will be no movement between those, and then their parades are both happening much later in the day, in the afternoon. So they're really separating out their events, and Arlington is going to have our reenactment on Sunday, and then Lincoln traditionally has their festivities on that Monday.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 201</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, and then just from my days gone by with organizing parades and reenactments, only because I know what I went through with growing pains, just about everybody in Arlington expects that around the Jason Russell House there'll be musket firings and things like that, and I understand from going through the packet that you provided us all, just the initial plans, that the three communities are still discussing about whether there can be, you know, cannons for event purposes obtained, and they may go off at certain points if it's feasible, and just to pass along, which you may already be doing anyways, one of the things when I was first doing parades and reenactments that I learned my lesson on is people pointed out to me that a lot of people are very sensitive. They expect it down by Jason Russell House, that musket firings and the noise, but if there is a dedicated cannon spot, whether it's David Lansing Way or somewhere else, maybe a look. I used to always just put a sandwich board out so that people would know, just because it's very, and it's not just children, some other people, PTSD. I'm not being melodramatic.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 99</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, this is, I don't think you're being melodramatic at all. These are things that we're actively discussing. First off, there will, we've already, Captain Flynn already worked out that there will be no cannon. Okay. Yes, and then Christine and I are working with the reenactors to see if there are different areas along the reenactment where we can not have gunfire or any kind of alarming noises, so all these details are are part of the conditional approval that needs to be worked out for public safety. Thank you again. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 114</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Diggins. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, I mean, the work I see that you've done is impressive, very impressive, but regarding the shutdown of Mass Ave, especially across Route 60, I'm not recalling that anytime recently, so I don't have a problem with it. I'm just, I'm sure you're going to do this, but just notify people well in advance of that closure, especially on the Route 2 and I guess I don't know how far in the other direction you want to go, but I would imagine people would appreciate knowing far in advance that Mass Ave is going to be shut down that day for five hours. That's it. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 9</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Diggins. Any further comments, Mr. Hurd?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 47</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, again, we're closing that down in, it's subject to discussions with the re-enactors and with town staff, so in the event that that happens, it will be, there'll be a lot of lead time and the town staff will make sure that we do it safely.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 65</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, very good. Any further discussion from the board? Okay, so we have a motion by Mr. Hurd and a second by Mr. DiCorsi and I've asked Ms. Marr to call the roll this evening. Mr. Diggins? Yes. Mr. DiCorsi? Yes. Mrs. Mahan? Yes. Mr. Hurd? Yes. Mr. Hellmuth? Yes. That's a 5-0 vote. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks to all.</blockquote>

And I'll note that we have been joined by Attorney Mike Huntingham. Welcome, sir. And then we'll go back to the top of the agenda and move to item 2, the approval of the sale of $200,000 in a sewer bond dated March the 4th, 2024, to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for the inflow and infiltration of local financial assistance program. And approval of the sale dated March 11, 2024, of $2,600,000 in water bonds to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for the local water system assistance program. And we are delighted to have our other deputy town manager, Alex McGee, who is also the finance director for the town. Welcome, sir.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 79</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Good evening, everyone. We're here to seek approval for the sale of some bonds that have been authorized at a couple of previous town meetings. As the chair noted, we're looking for $200,000 for sewer work and $2.6 million for water work. The water project is to replace the water main along Pleasant Street. And this is all MWRA subsidized loans, so they come with a 0% interest. So it's very advantageous to borrow money this way.</blockquote>

I'd like to move approval of the sale of the $200,000 sewer bond and the $2.6 million water bond. Mr. DeCorsi. Second. All right. Any discussion? Replacing 100-year-old pipe at 0% sounds like a good thing to me. Thank you, Mr. Diggins. OK, I think we're ready to vote, then, on a motion by Mrs. Mahon and seconded by Mr. DeCorsi. Ms. Marr. Mr. Diggins. Yes. Mr. DeCorsi. Yes. Mrs. Mahon. Yes. And Mr. Helmuth. Yes. That's a 4-0 vote. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. McGee.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 17</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      *  Cecily Miller, Arlington Commission for Arts & Culture </blockquote>

So item three, it's my pleasure to welcome Cecily Miller from the Arlington Commission for the Arts and Culture to talk to us about a request for approval of Arlington Stories banners.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Cecily Miller - 514</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, and I give us just a moment to get the slides up on the screen and into the Zoom. It's not a very fancy presentation this time. Always good to see you. Let me know when you want me to start. OK, go right ahead. OK. Well, the Arts Commission has supported a banner project in Arlington Center for about five years, I think, at this point. And traditionally, they're designed by youth. It's been called the Youth Banner Project. This year, the public school system decided they wanted to kind of take a year off and think about how they wanted to manifest public art and whether this was the way that they wanted to do it. So we came up with a different proposal this year, which involves inviting three artists to share kind of people of Arlington, people they know, people they think represent sort of interesting identities and character in the town. And it's something that could recur year to year with different people. In a way, it's returned to a project, the first project that I did in Arlington, which was called Storefront Stories. If any of you remember that, and that was portraits of the local business owners in East Arlington. This document just shows you three representative pieces of artwork by the three artists who've been invited. These are not the work that is going to be on the banners. But each artist will be working in their own style. And you can see that they do work in very different styles, which I think is kind of an interesting aspect of the project. But there will be identity branding on each banner to make it clear this is one uniform project. And I'm working actually with Katie to see if we can find a storefront location in Arlington Center to do a complementary display of the banner artwork on paper and short 300-word written portraits of the people, why the artist chose these people, and QR code to Arts Arlington, and a little bit about the artists. So sort of a whole display that kind of explains the banner presentation. So altogether, there will be nine banners, three by each of the three artists. Originally, I was hoping to bring in a youth component to continue that aspect of the project. But in the end, what the Arlington High School Art Department decided to do is an internal banner project. So they'll be putting banners up on school property in front of the high school around the same time. So the projects will be somewhat complementary. So that's the basic outline. And the area, actually, if you want to flip up, although I made an error. There are 11 to the map. There are 11, yeah, to the map. There are actually 11 banners, but that light pole banner stations, but it actually does extend up to here. There are three on this part of NUSAP and three on this part. Gotcha. I have a corrected map, if you would like one for your records.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 36</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that would be good to supply to the select board office after the meeting. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much. So I'll now turn to the board for questions, comments, and motions. Mrs. Mahan.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 167</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to move approval for the Celebrating Arlington Stories banners series, April 1st, 2024 to May 31st, 2024. And it's my understanding that sometime in March, the board will see what the banners that are going to go up will be? Yeah, sometime in March, exactly, mid-March. And I do want to say, I do appreciate, this is really the first time I think I've seen this particular document. It looks very simple, but I think it's good that we have a banner schedule that already has the Chamber of Commerce listed in there, and then the Commission for Arts and Culture, and then as we move forward with any other banner requests, if we could continue to receive this so that one of the questions we always ask, because we used to find out after the fact that we had overlapping, conflicting time. So thank you to whoever did that, and I look forward to also seeing that in the future. Thank you, Mr. Chair.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Cecily Miller - 69</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I should note that my understanding is that banners celebrating the high school graduation go up in June. So DPW will take ours down when those go up. Like, ours might be up for a little bit in June if they're not ready, or if they're ready, it'll be right at that time frame. But I'm pretty sure they use all of those light poles. OK, great.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll second Mrs. Mahan's motion, and thank you for the presentation tonight. All right, well, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any Mr. Dickens?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 304</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, me. So I'm going to be happy to vote for this. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Len, if we could just take down the screen here so we can see all of Mr. Dickens. OK, all right. Yeah, OK, now we have all of you, sir. OK, cool. You know, so I'm very happy to vote for this. I like the representative paintings, and I'm also, or drawings being in. I am happy that you mentioned that the high school is still having their banner display. And I was fortunate enough to be asked to be a judge again this year, and I got to tell you, there's some really impressive artwork coming out. So if you can get yourself around the high school when they have their banners up, I think you'll be happy to see them. And Ms. Biller, I'm going to put you on the spot and ask you, where is that utility box? It's near the fire station. Near Helena's? All right, I'll have to keep an eye out for it. I've walked past it a lot. I haven't seen it, but I really like that one. I really, really like it. Oh, no, no, no, wait. I think that's wrong. I think it's on Broadway Plaza, actually. It's somewhere right in the center, and I'm forgetting now. Well, I guess I'm putting you on the spot, but it's harmlessly so. But also, I want to talk with you about other things, so I'll get in touch. So thank you very much for all the work you do. And you know, that design style is based on these trucks that are painted by their owners in Pakistan. It's a Pakistani folk art form, that the trucks that do these long-distance deliveries are beautifully, colorfully painted. Yeah, it's spectacular, you know.</blockquote>

I'm deeply committed to contributing to our fight against climate change. I think trees have a role to play. I think trees have an economic value for the town, for homes.

I know quite a few Arlington residents are also involved, as you are, with those. So it's sort of like old home week for Arlingtonians. But to me, that's sort of each member brings a certain kind of expertise or something that really is going to add to the committee that we have. So I'm really excited to see that, because I know you'll be able to, it's going to sound like a pun, help grow this committee in a way that perhaps someone like myself had not thought about. So as I said before, and I mean this, it's an extremely important committee and it's done a lot of good things in the past, and I know it will in the future.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi everyone again My name is Katie loose. I economic development coordinator I'll try to make this brief since I know you still have quite a few items on the agenda so I'm before the board to get again, it's conditional approval based on a final location for the placement of a Marker indicating general Lafayette's visit to Arlington, which was at the time West Cambridge so this is a larger organization who is Responsible for creating these markers and getting them in different spots along the Lafayette Trail. They're called the Lafayette Trail organization They fully fund the creation of these markers So these markers are fully paid for which is always a great place to start and from the town's responsibilities It would be our commitment to install these and just make sure that we have the approval for whatever that location is So just to give you a little bit of backstory about John general Lafayette's visit He came through West Cambridge on September 2nd 1824 This year is 2024 which marks the 200th commemoration of this visit general Lafayette had a big impact in formulating the American democracy and so he had a very big celebratory final tour in 1824 and 1825 Currently, we do have enough evidence through secondary sources to justify putting a marker in our community I've provided a few here We don't have any primary sources, which means that our marker has to be a little a little vague a little general in the language Also given our name changes. It has to be a pretty simplified Marker language, which I've provided on the next slide So our marker would say Lafayette's tour on September 2nd 1824 general Lafayette was welcomed in this town. I did our I did the conversation an argument to say West Cambridge in parentheses And this is where we landed Local citizens greeted him in front of the meeting house, which is the present-day universal Unitarian Church And below is there the foundation that pays for these markers? Just to give you some context on the next slide I've provided and it's a little difficult to see so I apologize for that It's this is just one piece of a very large map But on this marker map we have in purple The purple square is where the Arlington mark would be and the blue dots are where other current markers are. So it is a very massive network Nearby markers include Lexington and Medford So placing a marker here would really add continuity on that trail, especially From Lexington through Medford because that was the route that he took I've thrown out a couple of proposed locations again I'm finally I'm working on a finalized Location because ideally it would be in front of the first parish, but of course that's completely up to them Well, ideally it's completely up to them whether or not they want to have a marker there What the foundation has asked for is that it would be placed somewhere along Mass Ave We could place it in Whittemore Park, those are just a couple of ideas I'm very cognizant of not overcrowding any particular area in Arlington Center with too many markers because there's a lot of history and a lot Happened and we love to have markers, but I don't want anything to be too distracting Yes So what I'm really asking for is conditional approval to make sure that this marker would be approved by The select board that you are in support of it If you have any feedback or suggestions or any strong opinions about where would you would like this placed? I am all ears okay,</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. Okay. So see I mean often what I tell people when they like want something permanent It's like well, you know when it's permanent a it doesn't allow me the space to be used for anything else You know and when something's there all the time the people just kind of stop paying attention to it Be so so be I find generally I mean if you take something down and put it back up You can also have like a little ceremony about bringing it back I just put that out there. I mean, I'm gonna agree with this, you know I'm just I'm just saying from discussions I've had with other people about wanting to commemorate other things on a permanent basis and how we Often say can we not do permanent, you know, but that's it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you That made me think of something in terms of whether it's permanent or not One of the things I used to always ask Lexington when I first came on the scene is, you know How was your tourism so vibrant? You know, what is it Lexington's doing that Arlington isn't and at the same time at that same meeting 15 18 years ago. They said how the heck do you have all those restaurants in Arlington? Why is it so vibrant? What isn't Lexington doing but one of the things there were two things they told me for tourism Which I know is a slice of the pie of your job as well as the other committees you interfaces They said, you know two big things Lexington tourism that has made us so Successful I thought they were gonna say hotels, but it was bus getting the bus companies a place to turn in and Be able to be on the route and right now I think the Schwamm went mill is the only one that has that and that's a last-minute thing they throw in but the other thing that they said was A historical markers statues, etc So I'd be for something permanent if possible because it's historical marker But the other thing is if you could maybe just keep in mind with safety Regulations boundaries, but if it's something that I mean if it's way way way too high You really can't it literally is people coming taking a picture in front of it. That's it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, good evening. Thank you for your time tonight. I'm very busy. The community development block grant administrator for Arlington and I'll be presenting the CDBG subcommittee's recommendation for program year 50 fiscal year 2025. So this year we received 18 applications from 15 organizations and town departments. The applications fall into the following categories affordable housing public services public facilities improvements in planning and administration the request totaled over one million six hundred forty six thousand dollars which is roughly six hundred and forty five thousand dollars more than our expected program year 50 allocation. The applications were reviewed by the CDBG subcommittee members individually using a rubric for evaluating projects and then reviewed collectively during two subcommittee meetings. The subcommittee established a budget totaling one million one thousand dollars which is our anticipated allocation for from HUD for program year 50. Once HUD announces Arlington's grant award for program year 50 the subcommittee may reconvene to adjust the budget as necessary. Any updates will then be presented to the select board. I'd like to thank the organizations that applied for CDBG CDBG funding organizations that do not receive funding for program year 50 are invited to apply again next year. I'd like to thank all the CDBG subcommittee members including Mrs. Mahan Mr. Hurd and Mr. Feeney who made the difficult budget budgeting decisions with Arlington's limited CDBG grant funds. At this time I'd like to request the select board and town manager approve the preliminary CDBG budget for program year 50 and move the CDBG report to town meeting for endorsement. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. First I'd like to move approval of the endorsement of the CDBG application. I want to thank Miss Muszynski for overseeing this process. I've been on the committee twice now. There was a little break in between and my second stint certainly is very different than the first. And first it's very appreciated by myself and the fellow subcommittee members getting weeks in advance you know the notification of the process coming up the grading matrix rubric rubric that we use as a guide and fill out. And I think you may have to fill it out because of HUD requirements. But it's certainly evolved along the way and it's really gotten to a great working document. And it's Miss Muszynski pointed out one point six plus requests one million six hundred thousand plus requests and only a million dollars to do that. And through the subcommittee meetings having to flip through various members especially you two representatives from the select board. What did we do last year. What did we do two years ago. Can you go in and level fund everything. Can you try it at 2 percent and it just eased right through. And that's a great testament for you being able to really wear all the hats you need to at that meeting. And I anticipate two to three hours each meeting and we pretty much can get it done in an hour each time which is really amazing. And I also want to thank Miss Muszynski in the in the town manager and Mr. Feeney and Claire Rick are our planning director because it was along with the cuts that we needed to make. We also added more work to our department heads and town manager in terms of going back with that six hundred thousand dollar cut and really re-evaluating and retooling but still being able to provide the services that I know the residents and the businesses of the town have come to expect. So it looks like you know and there were some really difficult decisions. Arlington needs each presented a great program which we would love to fund. But as Andy Doan noted when she was in here I think at our last meeting from Arlington needs a lot of the close to all of the applicants and people who are getting money from CDBG under public services Arlington needs works with and is very familiar with those programs. So very difficult decision but there was a lot of thought blood sweat and tears put into this and I really I know I'm probably going on too long but it's a great process and I appreciate you sort of heralding us through that. And so that we're productive make the difficult decisions but definitely have all the information and the conversation we need to have to get to as best a decision as we can. And Mr. Hurd honestly is invaluable. The first meeting I couldn't even really call in my speakers on my laptop a little lousy but you know he just took a hold of that and ran with it also. So thank you Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

Mr. Chairman I'll second Mrs. Mahan's motion I want to thank everybody on the subcommittee and as I look at the schedule this year I can imagine what you went through because I saw the amounts of the request and we ended up in you have that 15 percent limitation on public service and it must have been very very difficult and probably more challenging than any any year certainly from what I've received and I know you also looked at other opportunities maybe for some of these applicants whether it's CPA or elsewhere so it's tough to not being able to fund everything and I know this there's probably some people wish they their organizations they wish they got a little bit more but it's just it's just not available so thank you for all the work and for the difficult decisions that you had to make.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It moves us to Article 24 revolving funds and I believe we welcome back Mr. McGee to talk to us about the article. Hello again. Hello again. So just introduce yourself for the again.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 440</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex McGee deputy manager finance director. We are seeking endorsement for our list of revolving funds which will be presented on a Warren article number 24 at the annual town meeting. A lot of these are very familiar to this board and to the town meeting members when they ultimately vote on them. There are we're seeking to establish two new revolving funds this year. A cutter gallery rentals with a spending cap not to exceed 15000 dollars and that'll be rentals to hold small events at the cutter gallery and then a community center rentals fund to leverage some of the new facilities at the community center with a spending cap of 50000 dollars. These all these revolving funds the whole point of a revolving fund is to have revenues that are associated with the fund that can provide for continuing operations of the sort of associated activities of the fund. Another big change that we're looking at in FY 25 is an increase to the private ways repair fund. This is one that we have run up against our spending cap before which was previously set at 300000 dollars. We're seeking to increase the cap to one million dollars. That doesn't mean that we're going to be ever expending any more money than we normally would in any given fiscal year. But this just sets a new high ceiling that we cannot go above with the increase in costs associated with horizontal construction and the increase in requests to do private way repairs. We think that this is a prudent move. We are also seeking a change in how much revenue we collect up front as part of these projects with the intent to make this truly a self-sustaining sort of engine for doing those kinds of repairs. Beyond that all of the revolving funds spending caps remain the same as they have in the past. There are four revolving funds which I'll say are sort of on our watch list. They have zero dollar in anticipated revenues and zero dollar in anticipated expenses. And if we arrive at this juncture next year without really any other anticipated revenues or expenditures we may want to look at dissolving those funds as well. So one other to note our conservation revolving fund was dissolved at the FY or at the 2023 annual town meeting so that does not appear on this list anymore. And the funds from that were transferred the fund balance which was not very large was transferred out of that fund when we dissolved it. OK. So that is in a nutshell what we're looking for.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. And I neglected in the previous item to hold public comment because it's a public hearing. So I'll ask Mr. Cunningham after we finish this item how best to fix that. But for now let's do let's do this one right. So I'll now turn to the public and ask because this is a public hearing if there is public comment on this the article 24 revolving funds if you wish to comment please raise your hand and zoom or in the room physically OK. And I'll turn to members of the board for comments and motions Mr. Corsi.</blockquote>

And you mentioned some of the inactive ones and I don't know if the Gibbs school there's a balance in it the energy fund where that's back as a sixth grade for the past few years. I think the intent on that was when we there was more rental activity. I don't know if that's one to be to be looked at over the next few years as well. There might still be some minimal rental activity but it doesn't look like there's much activity. Thank you for the presentation. You're right. Yeah.</blockquote>

There's three pages worth of funds listed. It's the second to the last. It's. Oh OK. Now I see it. I'm sorry. No this has gone down like three times and I didn't have it printed out in paper. So now I do see that. OK. And it is a child. OK good. I'm saying I thought I should. OK. That's it. Good memory. I'm not trying to be like oh I remember that I don't. But anyways whatever.

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 48</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. So. So the change. So currently we request one third of funds be brought up front and the request to change to bring two thirds of the project costs up front. So it'll lead to a higher initial cash flow to sort of launch into the project.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 32</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Right. So. So. So do you. What do you imagine would be the impact on the residents who are trying to do a better make this kind of double up front.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 142</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Typically. So what we have seen is that somewhere in the 70 to 80 percent range of projects are paid in full up front. So. So most of the time they're paid in full. Most residents elect to do that. And so we thought that this was a reasonable number to get to that would allow us sort of smoother operations and to bring more projects on board in any given year. And that's that's that's a relief to hear because I could imagine that if people were struggling to do it that it would provide more incentive for people to not try to do the betterment or for it for them. You see you have to have two thirds of the residents vote for it. So that could provide less incentive for them to vote for it. So that's reassuring.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 126</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. So yeah. It was again the one million good. I mean and as you know the prices have gone up and they'll probably go up again. And we'll may have to race again and maybe also be a function like we have a lot of projects coming to to the foreground. Now it may be you know that we have these these kind of like what do you call like pig in the Python effect because like they come to they they we do them now. Then then 40 years from now we have to do all these again. So so just something to keep in mind. But yeah I'll be happy to support this. And I believe the time manager had a further comment.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 203</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah I think it's one to add some additional context along the lines of what Mr. Diggins is pointing out is that the change that Mr. McGee proposed will be discussed in a future warrant article hearing with respect to our betterment or private way bylaw. Thank you. Yeah I look for I look for the discussion I think since it was since the point was raised. If you can confirm my understanding of this is that if in that part of the discussion this is the two thirds and that affects the revolving fund. So that's the relevance. But that's two thirds of the money needs to be raised. It's not as it's not a requirement that each butter contribute two thirds up front. Correct. So just the project total project gap. So I mean given what you said of the 70 80 percent already coming in you know fully all the time and that's the basis of our comfort with that. Right. And then the balance of that 70 to 80 percent would elect to pay this betterment as a betterment on their tax bills. So over spread over five years they would pay whatever proportion of the project is theirs.</blockquote>

And I apologize for that. But I would recommend that the chair allow for public comment if any at this time. And then depending on the result of that call the there could be a motion from a member to revoke. All right. Yeah. That sounds good to me as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So thank you. Attorney Cunningham and the. So let's reopen article 23 the endorsement of the CDBG application. We don't need to redo the presentation but I will invite public comment on that. So if you are in zoom and wish to comment on article 23 please raise your hand and zoom at this time. Likewise if you're in the room please do the same thing. OK. Is my seeing none. Seeing none. OK.  So it's really cutting him suggested it might be prudent for a member to suggest a motion for a revote. Move approval of article 23.

Thank you. It's especially busy with remote members tonight and is a different experience. I must say I'm still getting used to that. Oh there we go. But I'll be back.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So that takes us to Article 36, endorsement of the parking benefit district expenditures. Mr. McGee, are you here for that too?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 227</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So Article 36, we're seeking endorsement for the parking benefit district expenditures budget. This is an annual budget that is prepared with a specific focus of the revenues that are generated by the parking benefits district, which essentially is, you can think of that as the bounds along Mass Ave that has metered parking. And so this takes into account all of the revenues that we anticipate collecting in a given year on one side of the ledger, and then on the other side, all of the sort of maintenance operations, and then other expenditures that we anticipate in the given fiscal year. So in FY24, we're starting the year with a fund balance of $623,000, and this year we're planning on closing the year with a balanced revenue and expenditure number. Now whether we come in exactly at that level, we're not entirely sure, but we're tracking pretty good, a little ahead of schedule with our revenues, and that is even with a couple months of downtime over last summer with our meter operations, so that's good news there. So we anticipate the same starting fund balance in FY25, and then making some targeted investments in 25 to the parking benefits district. If Mr. Feeney wants to talk about some of those high-level things, I'll turn it over to him.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 503</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. So there were three items within the parking benefit district expenditure budget that I would highlight for the board as they are sort of, you know, what I would call one-time expenditures. The first is for the Russell Common Lot. So there we've been, had some design and planning work underway through Public Works and our own engineering division to look at rehabbing the islands within the Russell Common Lot, which are frankly a bit tired, but also a challenge to maintain. So we're re-envisioning those islands whereby we would remove much of the currently impervious surface, replace it with some measure of pervious surface, but also seek to replace and provide a better environment for the existing trees, which are struggling to thrive and are not providing the canopy that folks would hope for, say, you know, the farmer's market or other events that happen in that lot. So you know, that's one sort of specialty project that we're looking forward to implementing and really making an improvement within that lot with an eye towards increasing shade and tree canopy. The second would be a line called electric upgrades. Last construction season, I headed up an effort to have what we know as GFCIs or receptacles put atop some of the pedestrian-scale lighting poles in Broadway Plaza so that, like we do in Arlington Heights and in East Arlington, we have a place to plug in string lights that could then be wrapped in a serpentine fashion around the light poles. So what we hope with that line is to expand that effort and continue to install additional receptacles on the somewhat dated pedestrian-scale lights in Arlington Center so we can hopefully over time achieve a uniform aesthetic as you drive through our business districts from sort of front to back or top to bottom, however you want to think about that. And then a line as well called for the 250th decoration. So again, that would be a one-time effort to increase and generate new banners, provide for additional flags and a number of other types of decorations and event and activity support for activities surrounding the 250th celebration. But as Mr. McGee alluded to, some of the other items are sort of year over year and more annual operations. I just wanted to flag some of those sort of above and beyond efforts that we were looking at within the Parking Benefit District. And I want to, you know, well, I have the opportunity to thank the, you know, we had to call a meeting of the Parking Advisory Committee and they were able to, you know, meet this morning to review this budget but also, you know, propose some other projects that we would undertake under our streetscape improvement lines. So we try to get input not only from committee members but the Chamber of Commerce, Katie Luzi, our Economic Development Coordinator. So that was a great effort and happy to see this before the board this evening.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, both of you. And I'll turn to the board. Mrs. Mahon. I'd like to move approval of Article 36 and I have one question that if it's a big long detailed answer, then I'll just follow up on tomorrow. But just looking at the figures for the FY24 budget versus actual and then FY25 budget, especially on single and multi-space meters, is that off? Why is that off so much? Is it because of the meters being down so much? Is it just a crazy estimate? So when I look at the FY24 budget and 25, they're close but that's because the pay-by-phone and that crazy interest comes into play. But I'm just wondering where that is and I guess we're going to adjust for that in the future.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 147</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I would say you've just hit upon what is the major discrepancy and that is the manner of accounting. In the proposed FY24 budget, there was NA in pay-by-phone but obviously pay-by-phone is becoming an increasingly popular way to make use of our meters and that is a, it comes in as a separate transaction so we're going to account for it separately. But there are funds within that line that could apply to both single-space and multi-space meters but for accounting purposes, it will be easier for us to track it as its own source. So that's what's skewing the actual FY24 numbers lower within the actual collections and we are modeling our FY25 proposed budget off the FY24 actual, not the FY24 proposed. So that's an anomaly. We probably won't see that. We'll see something but not to that extent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Feeney, Mr. McGee. And if I could just allude to the, you know, as Mr. McGee touched upon, you know, believe it or not, this summer when we were not technically collecting at our meters, there were still a number that were functioning and we're collecting some revenue but for the first two months of this fiscal year, we were not collecting the full amount of what we would expect. So you may notice that in the big picture, FY25 is a very modest increase over fiscal year 24 and I think we're conservatively looking to fiscal year 25 to be our new benchmark year for what a full year of collections looks like in a post-pandemic world. Thank you. Mr. DeCorsi.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll just second Mrs. Mahan's motion and a couple of comments and questions and given the decline in revenue because the meters were down, do you see expenditures being greater than the revenues for fiscal 24 and perhaps having to tap into the fund balance? What I would say is, you know, based on the revenues for fiscal year 24 to date, we are, you know, hovering at around 75% yet we still have a significant portion and it is a busier portion of the fiscal year for parking. So, you know, I'm actually feeling confident that we're likely to hit our revenue figures given that, you know, the first few months were not full collection months. And I'll also note that some of our expenditure line in FY24, we're still carrying some money that was encumbered from FY23, so it never closed to fund the balance, so that money was tied to a project that began in FY23 and is still being expended now. So I think that we'll be okay on the expenditure side as well. Okay, great. Thank you. And just I have to ask this question for Peggy Metropoulos. She brings it up a lot. On the trash management line, I see there's money that hasn't been expended. I think in talking to Mr. Feeney, there was still a plan to buy some, the big belly barrels for the far side of the Broadway Plaza or near the fire station, are those still on back order or in planning? We did receive yet another batch and you can start to see them in Arlington Center, but we still do have a few more forthcoming for some additional locations. Okay. And just a comment on the pay by phone, the app, I mean, it's remarkable how much people are using that. It hasn't been in that long and you're really going to see that take off, I think, in the future, which is great. Thank you. Thank you.</blockquote>

Sure. We can go there. Mr. Meehan? We own the meters. Okay. Well, that's, my next point was going to be, if we lease the meters, could we please do something about making them more visible in bright sunlight? They are impossible to read, and I don't understand how that missed, when the design was picked, how that was missed, because I have a very hard time making them out when the sun is full bright.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Paul Schlichtman - 436</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's nice to be back. Please go ahead, sir. Good. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. We passed a similar resolution last year, but I think that things have not improved. In fact, things have gotten worse, and I think it's worth voting the resolution again. I certainly would be very happy if it went through on the consent agenda, because I think it's more important that the resolution gets passed and spread to state leadership than to have any kind of an extended debate in town meeting, because I think the residents and taxpayers of the town of Arlington would be grateful to know the town meeting is aware of the issues with transit in Arlington and are looking to involve the state in the MBTA in terms of solving the problems. That said, since the resolution last year, a couple of things have changed. I've refreshed last year's resolution with a couple of additional points. One is that on January 29th, the Arlington School Department began running a parallel yellow school bus service in the mornings, because the service for our students going to Otteson Middle School became so bad, and we had such a critical issue with tardy students, because the buses weren't coming. That's just a representation of a further deterioration of the service in town, with the loss of the 79 and the significant reduction in the service of the 77. It's been a real problem for us to get our kids to school on time. Also, last year on October 25th, town meeting voted 189 to 35 to approve the transit-oriented housing zoning changes consistent with the MBTA Communities Act. I think that Arlington has been a leader in this. We passed this by a four to one margin. We fully support as a town the housing obligations that we have being close to the city and trying to become a transit-oriented community, but we can't do that without the transit. Thirdly, I think that we have new leadership, both in terms of the Secretary of Transportation and the MBTA General Manager, and I think it behooves us to ask that they come and talk to us. They've been very responsive to other communities. They haven't been here. We haven't asked them to be here. We should ask them to come here and address some of the issues that we're having. So that's the resolution. Hopefully we'll get a positive vote from the Board of Selectmen recommending the town meeting adopts this. We can get it through in the consent agenda, and we can all have apple pie afterwards. Select Board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. Go ahead, Adam. You can unmute yourself. Oh, I didn't. I missed some sound when it was switching over. Yes, I was saying that it was going to be enabled. I also think it's important to say this every chance we get, and it feels a little bit like the definition of insanity, because nothing happens and nothing happens and nothing happens. But I believe that someday something happens, and we should be there by doing this kind of stuff when that day comes. I also want to remind the Board that the T's new improved bus plan, which is not what we've got yet, but the thing that they're aiming for, will cut Arlington service to the Red Line by 20% compared to what used to be scheduled. And that it's actually worse than that, because within those cuts is a 60% cut to the Alewife service. The Board may recall that it received a report detailing these cuts a year ago and referred that to the town manager. And I just bring that up because we all know we have crappy service, but we also have the receipts and it can be useful in whatever conversations we might have in the future. That report, by the way, is in the correspondence received for February 6th of last year, if anyone wants to retrieve it easily. And the only thing I'd say about the resolution, maybe making it a little better, is I think it should, along with calling for all of the better service down Mass Ave., it should expressly call for improved service to Alewife. And I hope it all goes the way that Paul says it will. Thank you. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

As a member of the MBTA community's working board, but speaking for myself and not being so audacious as to suggest that the state has any responsibility for quid pro quo, we did put together a plan that was intended to take advantage of new housing in transit-oriented areas of the town. I certainly hope that the state is planning on providing the necessary public that we are counting on housing development being able to take advantage of. So I support this resolution wholeheartedly.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 566</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you just repeat that again if we're gonna move not the final language? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I think that with my situation, I don't have a conflict. We've moved favorable action generally depending on the specific content of the resolution, which we would do under votes and comments later. I may or may not have to recuse myself at that time, but we don't know what that is yet. Okay. Thank you. And thank you, Mr. Schlickman, for bringing this forward again. I note that last year it was article 66 as well. So coincidentally, it's gonna have the same number. I agree with the issues in terms of the service and speaking out on this. I think the resolution for me as a member of the select board, there's some language in here that if I were to do it, I might change or take it out. And specifically, I'm not sure I would pinpoint the city of Quincy in my resolution. I think that the real issue here is that the 14 communities that were part of the Metropolitan Transit Authority back in 1947 pay 82% of the assessment. Arlington is one of those 14 communities. Quincy wasn't. And so there are issues that we have in common with some other communities. Boston, Cambridge, and Brookline pay the highest assessment. Where it's all based on population and it's by a factor of nine for the remaining 14 communities. And then when the MBTA was created in 1964, there were additional communities added. Those communities don't pay as much. I think that's an area that's certainly worth exploring with others of the 14 communities. I would be a little reluctant just to target Quincy in this resolution. I realize what they're served by and the number of stations. And so, while personally I don't have a problem with this and for purposes of moving forward, I think I would be inclined to move favorably. Actually, I'm not doing it yet. But I also think it raises a larger question when you have a resolution before town meeting. And this clearly affects Arlington. And it just feels like this type of thing should go right to town meeting. Because unless we're gonna wordsmith it, and I don't really wanna change Mr. Schlickman's words around, I think there's maybe something to be explored with the moderator where there is something that's related to Arlington. Is there a way to just get it before town meeting so that if we make changes and Mr. Schlickman wants to bring a substitute motion, he doesn't have to. And I think this is the only resolution this year. Maybe it's a good opportunity to talk to the moderator to see when something like this is put before the body, do you really need the select board to weigh in? I mean, we may wanna do it individually. And again, certain things I might change. I wholeheartedly agree we have issues. We'd like to work more with the MBTA. And there's broader issues in terms of the assessment that I think we can work through or attempt to work through with some of our neighboring communities. So, just really a comment on that. But I thank you for bringing this forward. My colleagues. I feel like I'm jumping in front of Len all the time. Mrs. Mahan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly agree with Mr. DeCorsi's remarks regarding resolutions. And not to be sarcastic, I know this is the second year. I'm assuming we're not gonna see this every year. Because I think it might take away from the message it's trying to convey. But the other thing is, as I said before, with not going to a special town meeting wrote on the MBTA assessment. When I was reading this language in light of the remarks that I wanna make under new business and conversations that I've had and various members of the select board have had, regarding the MBTA assessment, which we pay more than Milton. I believe we pay more than Braintree. And besides just Quincy, we pretty much pay more than anybody else. And I think my remarks that I wanna say of steps moving forward on perhaps addressing the MBTA assessment, which I would say in a new business, I don't think it falls under this. But the reason I'm, I'd like to bring it up and then say what my concern is. But I'm fine with a resolution going up before town meeting. I agree in terms of maybe we need to streamline the process. In this, the board has a resolution they want to, just so that there's not an extra stop along Paul's railway for resolutions and others moving forward. Yeah. But, and again, it's a resolution. So I'm not gonna stand on the top of the hill and say I'm gonna fight this to the whatever. But I do think there are a step or steps regarding our MBTA assessment that we'll have future discussions on. In this resolution, I don't think, unless somebody took it word for, unless the MBTA took it to heart word for word. And I just don't see that happening. So I guess, is there no motion right now? There's no motion. Okay. I'd be interested in Mr. Diggins.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like I'm always taken away. That's fine. That's fine. I'm happy to last. I mean, I'm happy to say last. And certainly I just want to make it easier on the chair since I am remote. Well, you all know my posture towards resolutions in general. I kind of said that if there's gonna be a bunch of them, my high water point was gonna be abstained. I think partly it's because the BLM resolution just left a bad taste in my mouth because I think to a large extent, these resolutions can be crafted in a way that doesn't disservice me to town meeting, almost dares town meeting, not to have a nuanced, I mean, discourse, I mean, first off, you only get seven minutes on both sides. I mean, so it's really hard to have a meaningful discourse. And so, I mean, who wants to vote against apple pie? Look, the T is doing all it can to make service better. I mean, for everyone, I mean, if you look at the board of directors, either the meetings or the slide decks, you'll see the great efforts that are being made and strides that are being made. I mean, it's in a tough position. And yeah, it's gotten into a really tough position. It's gonna take it a while to work its way out of it, but making good progress, you know? And so if we could do this resolution year after year, and one of these years is gonna sync up with the T coming out of it, and then we'll be able to say, oh, the resolutions did it, you know? But it really would have been more of a correlation than a causation, you know? With respect to the assessments, Mr. DeCosta laid out the problem very well. For a while, I was under the strong impression that when Fall River came online, we were going, the South Coast expansion of the commuter rail, that we would, that the T would then take on the reassessments because we'd have more communities being serviced by the MTA. When I talked to Senator Crichton, one of the co-chairs of the transportation, the Joint Transportation Committee about a year ago, I mean, he was not aware of anything being with respect to, happening with respect to assessments. I've kind of touched on the topic a little bit with the executive director of the MTA Advisory Board. That is someone also that would suggest that we have come to meet with us. We tried to get the chair of that body to meet with us. He tried twice. There was an illness in one case and a death in another case. I mean, we could try with him again, but Brian Kane, the executive director, is, I think, more easily available. I think he could give us some guidance as to how to potentially move the assessments issue. I will add to that, though, that the governor has set up a transportation funding task force, and that's for statewide, and I think that would be a good place to have the discussion about assessments in general and other ways, be it funding, transportation, and transit. I'll just offer, because I am going to vote, I would like, let's go with Mr. Corsi's. Maybe we could just bypass the board completely on this and maybe on resolutions in general, because that motion is going to abstain for me on this. But I will offer you this in all earnestness, that I will be happy to work with you to have people talk with us, in large groups or small groups. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have regarding any future endeavors to make the T better. And I'll leave you with this, and that kind of concerns 79 to a certain extent. 79, it's very unlikely that it's coming back, especially when you take into account that one of the big initiatives now that the T is taking is to provide half fares for low-income riders. And that's going to cost the T probably about $30 down to $50 million in about five years. Chances are, low ridership en route to me, like the 79, just aren't going to come back. The resources could be shifted towards that. And I guess I did say one thing. I'll just throw in another point too, about the school buses. I don't know who ever thought it was a good idea to take out school buses and use public transit instead. I can appreciate that maybe schools were stretched to provide transportation, and that was a way of shifting that financial load onto public transit. But you're taking the rush hour period, and then you're putting this bike rush on top of it. There's just no way you can provide the capacity to do that. I can think of other ways to do it, but I wouldn't put it on public transit alone. It's just asking for trouble, and we got trouble. That's it, thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just, there's a history here, Mr. Diggins, that the MBTA actually used to provide special school bus services to the town of Arlington. And again, I'm dating myself. You learned today what year I was born. Now I was going to high school in the late 70s, early 80s. And the Almont bus, I lived up at the Heights. The MBTA used to provide a dedicated school bus to the town of Arlington. They did it at the Audison, and they did it at the high school when Mrs. Mahan and I were at the high school, and then Proposition 2 1⁄2 came along. And again, we're not going back to those days, but there was a long history in our community for the T recognizing, okay, we're not gonna fill up the 77 bus with students as it goes up and down Mass Ave. We'll provide a bus at 210 for Arlington High School. There was a period where the Audison, they provided a dedicated bus. So that was a history, and it's a long, long time ago, but things were different back then. But I want to go back to the assessments, and I really, we had Mr. Jameson in recently. We've heard from Mr. Toste. Mrs. Mahan has spoken about it over the years, and I think we're gonna hear from her again tonight. And again, just a little history lesson that the Boston Elevated Railway became the Metropolitan Transit Authority in 1947. We happened to be one of 14 communities. Based on service that was in place in 1947 and those communities, that has dictated the percentage that we pay on our assessment. And look how the T has changed since 1947 and in 1964 and throughout the years. We pay a multiple of many other communities. And when you look at the MBTA Enabling Act, which is Chapter 161A, there are still 14 communities defined. Those 14 communities are the original MTA communities. There's another 51 communities that are identified. And then beyond that, to get up to 178 or 175, whatever it is, there's other served communities. And with the assessment, while we're only, we're talking 8 to 10% of the T's budget, I think the total assessments to local communities is 193 million. Boston pays half of that. Our share for next year will be about 2% of that. That to me is a real discussion that should be had about, you may have been fine in 1948 to pay a higher percentage, but the service to Arlington relative to other communities, and there's other communities that are similarly situated too that should be a discussion for the legislature to take a look, how is this being allocated? And that's why I mentioned my concern. I wouldn't, as I said earlier, I wouldn't point directly at Quincy. I'd point at the definition of the communities and I'd like an opportunity maybe to talk to Mr. Schlickman after the meeting, between meetings, maybe to suggest some changes with that paragraph. Because I think there's a way to maybe add a little bit more there that points to the, what I would consider the unfairness to the 14 communities as part of the overall discussion. Thank you. So at this point, I note that we don't have a motion on the table. I know Mr. Schlickman has his hand raised, but I'll check and see if my colleagues wanna go now before we get back to Mr. Schlickman.</blockquote>

I think it was, I know it was after Proposition 2 1⁄2, I think it was 1999. I think there were about 78 other communities that were coming into the T at the time. It's pretty well known anecdotical history in the State House that the person, Senator who represented Milton Quincy and Braintree had a position of authority in setting the assessments. And basically it's been pretty well known for 20 plus years that, in my opinion, from what I've been told, Arlington really is carrying as a, because of what came out of the State House and that particular person who is chairing the process at the time, we're really paying a good amount of Milton Braintree and Quincy's portion. And I think, and I'll just again discuss it under new business, there's a way, I think there are ways to address that, but I certainly think there's a way that this board has been sort of discussing a little more diligently or with a little more earnesty over the past two to three years.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and I would, I know Mr. Schlickman has his hand raised. I would encourage, especially on that Quincy, I agree with that too. I don't know if that gets reworked or whatever, but I know I would do something to it, but anyways. So I would encourage and hope that Mr. Schlickman and Mr. DeCorsi have the opportunity to speak about that, and I'll just give my thoughts offline at another time to Mr. DeCorsi about that, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, first of all, the purpose of the Quincy paragraph is a discussion of equity, and that I think that Arlington really deserves the opportunity to get what it pays for. I'm not as concerned with the amount we're paying, but for the getting our money's worth and getting a subsequent value relative to what we're contributing, and that's sort of the point, and I'm very happy to work with Mr. DeCorsi to come up with some language that the board would be more comfortable with. Quincy's just an easy example because they're a bigger city with a much larger population and considerably more service, and they're assessed at a lower rate because that's just the most vivid and visible example I can come up with. And the assessment rates are in state law, so it's a matter of calculation, calculate the number of people in a municipality and multiply that by a given factor, and then assess that by the assessment rate, which keeps going up. Now, as for the student transportation, this has been a mission of the MBTA since it came to be, and first of all, Massachusetts law does not require school districts to provide transportation for grades seven through 12 unless you're in a regional district. And students in Lowell have T-passes from the Lowell Regional Transportation Authority. and the buses line up at the high school and work their way out from there at the end of the school day. Every student in Boston who is transported has a T-pass and everybody who has a T-pass buys the T-pass and our students are buying a T-pass to use the MBTA and this is what has gone on historically since the MBTA came into business. This is just an element of the MBTA failing to meet their responsibilities that has been a traditional purpose for them to provide services to us as well as students throughout the region. That's why we view it as an issue that the MBTA has turned their back on something that we've relied upon them to do for generations and that dumping the problem in our laps where we've got parents who are so angry that their kids aren't coming to school in town and that we can't get the MBTA to respond. This is the issue why we ended up instituting a bus with user fees and it's troublesome for us. We don't have the bus infrastructure to go and run a parallel bus service. MBTA has made a commitment a long time ago to be a partner with the school districts within the MBTA service area and they should be held accountable. I am very grateful to the board for supporting this effort. I hope we're not back here next year. I hope that we have a communication with the leadership of the MBTA and the State Department of Transportation. I'm more optimistic this year than last year, but I think some element of success would be for us to all work together to bring the T into town, to make us more of a priority rather than just turning our hands up and saying, well, what are we gonna do? The T's got problems. We'll let them solve their problems and then we'll think about what happens in Arlington. If Arlington does not advocate for Arlington, nobody's gonna advocate for Arlington. Right now, any time I've seen any discussion in the MBTA over the past couple of years, I have not seen once the town of Arlington even mentioned. And I think we need to change that. I really do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. So at the moment, we have a motion. We do not have a second. I'll second Mrs. Mahan's motion. Okay. Okay, further discussion?</blockquote>

Well, I don't agree with much of what Mr. Fitzgerald said, but the way it was put makes me feel that it's not really worth arguing at this point. But all I'll say is that I am willing to work, to try to reach out to folks that I think could be helpful in at least getting some answers, and maybe even moving things a little forward with respect to assessments, but I will not be supporting the motion.

Okay, that ends the warrant article hearings. Brings us to item 15, correspondence received. We have an informational memo. This suggests no action, but informs the board of the work that the town proposes to undertake in response to the Broadway crosswalk request. And that is from John Alessi, Senior Transportation Planner.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll move, turn to the board. Move receipt, and I want to thank our Senior Transportation Planner, Mr. Alessi, for his memo to us that right now, there is no immediate action to be taken on this, but that's because, as he points out, there are conversations and considerations and recommendations being formulated for the streetscape improvements, which are planned later this year. And he has indicated that that's where this and other intersections along Broadway, all the way down to Sunnyside, North Union Street, will be addressed. So, while initially it seems no action, it's not because we already have an action and something's about to come out to address that. So, long way of saying move receipt. Yeah, thank you for that elaboration. I think that's good service to the public there. Second.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 1274</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Regarding, Mr. Jameson was here at our last meeting, and I know we've been having conversations, some of us ad infinitum all the way back to Mr. DeCorsi's Finance Committee days regarding the assessment. I have had conversations with the town manager and town council as recently as today, including, God bless you, you're on vacation, Attorney Cunningham, but I've still been bothering you about where Mr. Jameson correctly pointed out that there's another new factor under the MBTA Communities Act, that Communities Overlay District Act that Arlington is now officially labeled as an adjacent community, whereas Milton, Quincy, Braintree, or Commuter Rail or Rail Trail, that's CTRT, and we're just adjacent community with bus service that has been, they don't point out this point, but drastically cut, as well as limited, and Mr. Jameson did ask us to look into the possibility of either putting something in the regular town meeting or special town meeting, but after conversations, as the town manager pointed out that the formula is codified by state law under a statute that, of course, the board could put something in a warrant, but it really would not be the correct route, or the direct route to address this, and I did have conversations last year with Representative Garbally about, since it is a state statute that governs the assessment, and I understand there's a formula, but there's something wrong with the formula. There's still that state house, everybody knows it, and nobody really says it publicly. I mean, I'll pick on the city of Quincy just because Mr. Schlickman has pointed it out. If you go by, oh, there's a formula, we're stuck to it, well, Arlington has approximately 42,844 residents as of July 2022. Quincy has 102,897 residents, and we pay a million plus more than them. So there's, yes, there's a formula, and there's a factor of nine, and I'm not saying this to Mr. DeCoursey, but there's also tweaking that started at the beginning that, in my opinion, really, pardon my language, my dad will get mad at me, but I know he's asleep, so he's not watching, really stuck it to Arlington, and to me, it's gone on long enough. Since 1999, it's time to change that, and one of the ways to change that, and I'm not saying there aren't other ways, but last year, Representative Gobley and his staff, his office looked into, I asked them to look into the state statute, and governed in that state statute is language that the MBTA assessments are supposed to, every July, go through an automatic reassessment, which hasn't really happened, and so one of the ways that he suggested last year, and the town manager and town council, because I don't want to waste anybody's time, including all of our time in the manager and others, but I've asked them to look into formally taking that step. I believe it's through the legislative delegation, I'm not asking us to discuss it here tonight, because that would be a future agenda item or something else, that we ask our legislative delegation to, since it's in the statute, it's in state law, there's no way, even if I think Arlington and our delegation said, okay, please do it by the formula that you have with the factor of nine, which is population, and then you're also supposed to add into what type of community you are, which we've now been officially an MBTA adjacent community, we're not even a CT or an RT, that assessment should go down, so my hope is that since the state law statute says the reassessments are supposed to happen every July, I've asked the town manager and town council to have conversations with the delegation to say this is the route we would like to go, we'd like to, there really are no reassessments, but they're supposed to be, we're gonna ask you to do that, and or they recommend other ways for us to get the assessment. I don't wanna just have a meeting where we meet with a titular head from the MBTA or the MBTA advisory community, complain about this, because everybody knows this has been going on, and we just say it and nothing happens. I want something, as we all do, that has some teeth to it, so the town manager and town council are looking into to see if asking our legislative delegation and when that request, when the request should come from this board, and when the legislative delegation should actually file that request, I'm assuming it's at least a month, six weeks before, the fiscal year starts July 1st, which is what the state law says, and as well as perhaps when they're investigating that, with Senator Freeman, Representative Garberlee, and Representative Rogers, there may be another suggestion. Under the state statute, because I think that's the only way we can get any relief is to, MBTA, the law that was created under the state statute, at the very least, we somehow have to make the request, fine, then let's do it by the formula that's in there that goes by population in a factor of nine, which means we're gonna be paying less than Quincy, Milton, and Braintree, which we pay millions of dollars more than them. We'll be more in line with like Lessington, which pays about 829,000, so I just wanted to, and I know we've all had individual conversation, members of the boards, with the manager and with town council, so I don't want anyone to think since I'm so wordy on this, and I think because I've been on the board longer than anybody here, since 1999, that's why I'm like, oh, I'm so tired of hearing about this every year and how the MBTA assessment is unfair to Arlington and all these other cities, and we're a town, don't even come close to pay what we're paying, but I feel confident that, especially in light of the budget presentation given by our town manager, Mr. Feeney, and our deputy town manager, Mr. McGee, at the last meeting regarding Chapter 70, which I hope the news that we receive does get a little bit better, but there aren't really indication that that's gonna happen, as well as other things, including living within the guidelines and the promises we made to the voters who were gracious enough to, once again, open up their wallets, pocketbooks, bill of odes, whatever, and vote for the last override, so this is something we'll continue to address, and then the only other thing, under new business, because we have to do blank and giggles every now and then, I've never noticed this before, but Michael Quinn posted to the Arlington List earlier this morning that, and I went and looked, and he is correct, that if you look at the warrant, it says right in the beginning in the preamble, and of course, right now, I can't find it, basically language saying, town meeting's about to convene, here is the warrant, please notify and warn your inhabitants of the warrants contained therein, so I just point that out, I'm not trying to change that language, but I never noticed that, if you look at, I went online, looked at our draft warrant, went in the very beginning, that very first paragraph before all the warrant articles are laid out, it does say to notify and warn inhabitants, so, and I thought that was kind of a cute, historical little thing that's in there, that's it, thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

We had a meeting last Thursday, we're going to have another one this Thursday, Jim Stubbe, who we corroded to full-time, or a full TAC member, is just doing phenomenal work, and it's a, yeah, I'm enjoying it immensely, and I think we're going to be able to bring something back to the board, probably within a month, so that's the new business, and a little bit of a teaser.</blockquote>
