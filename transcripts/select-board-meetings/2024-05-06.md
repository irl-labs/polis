<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      *  Talia Fox, Sustainability Manager</blockquote>

Now, we are going to go out of order on the remaining articles. I'm going to do Article 4 last this evening. So, I'm going to move on to item five on the agenda, the Fossil Fuel-Free Bylaw Waiver Guidance. And Talia Fox, our Sustainability Manager, is here along with our Building Inspector, Mr. Champa. Good evening. Good evening. I did have a couple of slides. It's pretty straightforward, though. We're back again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Talia Fox - 398</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening, Sustainability Manager Talia Fox. Thanks for your time. I'm here to discuss updates to the proposed guidelines for the prescription of waivers under the Fossil Fuel-Free Bylaw. I was here on April 8th to discuss these guidelines, and the goal, similar to that conversation of our conversation today, is to determine what, if any, changes to make to the proposed guidelines which we've updated prior to the Select Board's adoption of those guidelines. So, as a reminder, if you could go to the next slide. As a reminder, the Fossil Fuel-Free Bylaw takes effect on May 21st of this year, and the bylaw specifies that the Select Board is to provide guidance regarding the granting of waivers prior to that effective date. The bylaw specifies that waivers can be granted where compliance with the bylaw renders a project financially infeasible or impractical to implement. Next slide, please. The previous draft of the guidelines was presented to the Select Board on April 8th. The draft required applicants to provide a narrative describing the factors that make the project commercially unviable due to additional costs or delays associated with the fossil fuel-free equipment or electrical service upgrades required to comply with the bylaw. At the April 8th meeting, the Select Board recommended clarifying the definition of commercially unviable, and the Board specifically suggested referencing the comprehensive permitting or similar processes for guidance. Next slide, please. So the team, being the Director of Inspectional Services and the Town Manager, had a discussion regarding refining the guidance, and we settled on the term substantial financial hardship as a basis for granting a waiver rather than commercially unviable. The guidelines clarify that costs or delays associated with the project are exceptional, exceeding typical costs and delays of similar projects. So that's how the Director of Inspectional Services will determine whether it's a situation of substantial financial hardship. During our discussions about how to refine the guidelines, the Town Manager and Director of Inspectional Services had suggested basing the guidance off of the protocols for granting a zoning variance, which uses the same substantial hardship language. And the Director of Inspectional Services is here today if the Board has further questions about how decisions regarding the waivers might be made in accordance with the updated guidance. And that is all I have. Thank you for your time. Happy to answer any questions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you, Ms. Fox. And apologies, Mr. Chamfer. I said Building Inspector. Director of Inspectional Services said I want to make sure I get that correct. I'm sorry. No slight. I'm sorry. I changed Christine Burn's journal last night. So we appreciate the update since you were here on April 8th and identifying the areas that we had. So I will turn areas of concern or question, turn to members of the Board for any questions, comments of Mr. Helmuth.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 105</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for coming back. I think, as I recall, I may have had a lot to do with you coming back with the request for clarification. So I really appreciate the thought and the care you put into it. And I'm really happy with what I see. I think it strikes a balance between being more specific but not too specific, you know, in the recognition that it's a pilot program and that we need to really figure out how to apply that. So I'm really grateful that you came back with this. I think it was worth the effort.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 67</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Thank you, Mr. Helmuth. Any other comments? Mrs. Mahan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Helmuth, for bringing them back. But he did make a very good point. I have two questions. In terms of the process for waivers, is that something you, Mr. Champa, will handle yourself? Is it something that you and others in your department can handle or someone else besides you?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Ciampa - 43</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I would handle it. But in collaboration with other inspectors, particularly the wiring inspector, where their hardships would sometimes be based on service upgrades, upgrades to power lines, transformer upgrades that may be necessary in order to power a particular home.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 227</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then just, and I thank you, Ms. Fox, and others for the clarification on what the financial hardship would be. And I know the chair also had some thoughts on that. I just have a hypothetical in terms of, and I know it's difficult in the construction business. One of my first jobs was blazing granite suffolk construction. It's all, it's all, it's all. And back then there were different kinds of guidelines in terms of a waiver process back then. And there was just a very small minority, usually subcontractors, that intentionally or not set the project up for an issue by purposely choosing a manufacturer or a sub subcontractor that they knew wouldn't probably be able to provide either the hardware or the craft service needed as a sub subcontractor. So my question and my hypothetical is, is when you're going through the financial hardship, when it comes to a delay, is there something in place that can sort of safeguard, like, can you look at the proposal and say, listen, everyone knows that's based out of Switzerland. They never get anything out. They're trying to say, you know, I need this waiver because I can't get this in time when this company or craft never was going to come through. Or is that just too much fine detail for us to expect?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Ciampa and Diane Mahon - 317</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll definitely be reviewing the, more the ability to procure equipment rather than, you know, their, the specific delay that they may be having with the equipment that they've chosen. It'll, it'll need to be, it'll need to be, you know, more specific to the, more specific to the industry. It can't just be that they chose this specific equipment and they're not able to get it for eight months. So, you know, they want a waiver and they want to be able to use fossil fuels. It, it has to be, you know, it would be more when talking about equipment, it would be more delay probably caused by Eversource and the ability to upgrade the power lines so that the four, you know, be it a 400 amp service could be properly brought in from the street versus, so it's, we have to look at needs versus wants. And it, we, I at least wouldn't feel that it would be, that it would, that it would be, you know, something that could be a waiver applied for because they chose equipment that would not be available. And then it probably goes without saying that in terms of if something should happen and something was substandard or not done correctly, the town doesn't have any culpability in terms of if there's somehow a legal claim. I'm, I'm right in the middle of the gas explosion depositions up in Lawrence and everything there. But so if the town were to grant a waiver and something went awry, that still remains with, in terms of legal liability with the general contractor and others, it doesn't fed her back to the town because we gave a waiver. No, I mean, the town would only be giving a waiver from the fossil fuel free regulation. It wouldn't be giving any waiver from meeting state regulations for installations. Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mrs. Mahan. Any other questions? Mr. Hollis, just a quick follow-up question. Can you, I don't want to add more work to your plate. Lord knows you have enough, but from the record keeping that you'll be doing when you make a waiver decision, I think I'd like to make sure that we learn from that because it is a pilot and, and have a way, can you imagine a way that, you know, again, with the existing workers that you have, that you could report to this body, you know, in a year or so what those look like, how many there have been, what, what the credit cost extra costs were and all that.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Ciampa - 103</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we, we, we can definitely track it and we, we had planned to anyways, because it, because it is such a new thing. And even with a lot of electric homes already having been built, most were duplexes and there haven't been many situations where, where there's been the requirement for a 400 amp service. And so we're not as familiar with, with, you know, a lot of the, the challenges that there may be because we just got over the challenges from COVID as far as procurement of supplies and et cetera. So, cool. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Mr. Hollis.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 71</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Diggins. Well, since Mr. Hellmuth took us there, you know, I'm going to ask now, this pilot is going to be for 10 communities, right? I imagine there's going to be a report out on the entire pilot, right? And so we'll probably be able to see that report. So we have the biggest set of, of events for lack of a better word from which we can learn, right?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 170</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I may, we are required to report every, every summer, all the data on permits that have been granted under the program from the past year. So I'm not, I'm not sure yet exactly how that will work. I mean, we've generated some reports in OpenGov in anticipation of the data reporting requirements, but we haven't gotten guidance specifically from DOER about the format of that or any other sort of summary reports that they may be doing. Although I anticipate we'll, we will see that because they'll want to report back on the overall successes or challenges of the pilot. So we can certainly report back on those. We also have added the fossil fuel free pilot and the specialized stretch code into OpenGov. So everything will be tracked through OpenGov as well. Yes. And we've, we also had a recent meeting to finalize the form, the waiver form, and there's a, there's a certificate involved. So yeah, we'll have ways of keeping track through OpenGov. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 211</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Biggins. And I just want to elaborate on a point following Mr. Helmuth's question of you, Ms. Fox, in terms of, so the Title VI, Article X, Section E2 deals with waivers and the guidance to be provided by the select board. And I just want to point out one of the things that it also says in the bylaw is that that guidance will be periodically extended or amended in the light of experience and changing circumstances. So we encourage both of you, come back to us if you're seeing things out in the field that you feel that should be changed or updated in the guidance. So because the guidance is coming from the select board, we've received a lot of comments. Actually, we'll be looking for a motion if anybody is so inclined to adopt the guidance. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Helmuth. Okay. So a motion by Mr. Helmuth, seconded by Mr. Biggins. Anything further that you wanted to add? I don't think so. Okay. Thank you. All right. Great. Any further comment? All right. So on a motion by Mr. Helmuth, seconded by Mr. Biggins. All in favor say aye. Aye. Great. Unanimous. Thank you very much for coming back. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So what we're going to do next is the Item VI is the Discussion Approval Draft Select Board Report to Special Time Meeting. We haven't had our hearing on Article IV. And for reasons that will become apparent in a moment, we're going to return to that at the end of the meeting. But I would like to discuss the draft report as it pertains to Articles II and V. And I'll turn to Attorney Cunningham. I think you already had sent us comments on Article II, and now we have the comments on Article V.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, that's correct. And I just appreciate the tight timeline that the Board is under to get this report to Special Time Meeting before Wednesday. So a draft, the bones of a report have been prepared for the Board members for tonight. Obviously, the discussion and debate on Article IV is pending, so that can be inserted tonight, hopefully, and if it's approved by the Board or whatever action the Board chooses to take, a finalized report could be then provided hopefully to members of Special Time Meeting tomorrow, so they could have that available to them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll second. I do have some comments. No, go right ahead. So this is not a hill that I'm going to even scrape my knee on, okay? The comments on V are fine. If I were to change them, I would do, in this order of preference, just the first paragraph. That would be my first preference. My second preference would be the first paragraph, and the third paragraph, and then my third preference is to keep the second paragraph. So if anyone's inclined to agree with that, I'm for it, but as I said, it's fine as it is.</blockquote>

We have a preliminary draft vote and comment from Attorney Cunningham. Before I turn it over, Attorney Cunningham, did you want to start the discussion?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. No, I think it would be most appropriate for Ms. Suarez to initiate the discussion about this particular article. Okay, great. Ms. Suarez, thank you for coming in this evening.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Suarez - 477</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for having me. I'm Sarah Suarez. I'm the Assistant Director of Planning and Community Development, and I'm here tonight to discuss a parcel of town-owned land located behind the St. Athanasius Church along Acton Street and Appleton Place, which you can see on the screen there. This land also faces the Auduson Middle School, which is at the bottom of the screen. In 1963, the town extended Acton Street to connect to Appleton Street through the now Auduson School property. This road extension resulted in an orphaned strip of land on the opposite side of the road from the school. This land is adjacent to the St. Athanasius Church property and extends the entire length of Acton Street. In 1970, the church requested permission to pass over the town's land to access its parking lot in the rear of the property. The town engineer investigated and made two recommendations to the select board. One would be the entire strip of land be sold to the church via a warrant article at the 1971 town meeting, or access be granted to the church to alter and use the strip of land as requested. While no warrant articles have been discovered related to this, it would appear the town chose to grant access for the church to cross over the land to access its parking lot. There have been subsequent discussions about the town's land since 1970, and there is a renewed interest at this time because the church is in the process of selling its rear parcel along Acton Street and Appleton Place, which is bordered by the town's land. So as you can see, there's a line that cuts kind of across the middle of the screen there above the triangle, and the portion to the bottom of the screen would be the portion of land that is being sold. And actually, if you want to go to the next slide, it's a little easier described. During discussions between the town manager, town council, and staff, it was determined that now would be a most appropriate time to proceed with the disposition of land. On its own, the town land is just over 5,000 square feet and comprised of a triangular shaped portion at the northwesterly quarter of Acton Street, and a long narrow strip running along the length of Acton Street, southeasterly to Appleton Place. Due to the unusual shape and limited square footage, this is an unbuildable lot on its own. There are no utilities on site, no conservation restrictions, and there is limited financial value of the property as it is. However, it could be considered more valuable considering the adjacent land is now for sale. I will now turn it over to town council to answer any legal questions and the next steps for the disposition of land for your consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Ms. Suarez. Attorney Cunningham, would you like to add anything? Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you, Ms. Suarez. I just want to thank Deputy Town Councilman Munson and Peter Buckley from the legal department's office for all their work on this. This is the first step in the process for the potential disposition of this property. The select board takes its initial step. It would then go to special town meeting for a vote and weigh in. Because it's school, it's property that's under the care, custody, and control of the school department, this would need to go to the school committee. They would need to declare its surplus if they did so after town meeting, and then it would come back to this board for potential restrictions on disposition in working with the town manager's office. That's the basic process. This is just the first step, but it was a difficult property to do the historical research on and figure out where it came from and what was happening. Fortunately, through the hard work of community planning and development as well, it was really... We were able to come to a conclusion about exactly what parcel we're talking about.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Attorney General Kennedy. Again, just for clarification, we had that earlier diagram, and here we're looking at the parking lot that's used by... I believe that the artisan uses it, but it's the church parking lot that they've granted use. Years ago, there used to be a pull-up that designated the separation between what was being used for school purposes and what was being used for the church. Is that... Okay. Attorney Cunningham?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 57</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just in follow-up to that, this property is subject to the public bidding provisions of Chapter 30B. Therefore, if authorization is provided and all those steps that I've outlined are taken, there's no obligation on the part of the town to sell this property. It would essentially be out to the highest bidder.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 351</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Thank you. I will note, as I looked at this and received it, appreciate all the research that was done. This parcel in the church was acquired originally, I think, in 1913, and when the present church acquired the land, there was no update to the plan. I think that's what made it so challenging to determine what was there. Thank you for your additional research. Any comments or motions or questions from the board? This is a public hearing, so I'll start with initial questions, see if any member of the public would like to be heard. No one. Okay. There is nobody in the chambers that wishes to ask questions. Is there anybody on Zoom? Seeing no hands raised, Mr. Hellmuth. Okay. All right. So I will return to the board. Mr. Hellmuth? I'd like to move favorable action. Thank you. Motion for favorable action. Mr. Diggins? I second that, Mr. Chair. Okay. Any further discussion? Okay. We have a motion for favorable action by Mr. Hellmuth, seconded by Mr. Diggins. All in favor say aye. Aye. Great. So at least this phase is done. There was language in there, and again, Attorney Cunningham and Attorney Munson have written up draft comments, assuming that the vote went through. Maybe we could have a motion to approve this subject to further review based on what went on this evening. Just because of the time frame in submitting our report to town meeting, we're not going to be coming back to have a final vote on it. Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Mahan. We have a second. Mr. Diggins? I'd like to note that our Attorney Cunningham is remarkably prescient in his anticipation of the more sense of the board this evening. Well done, sir. He's got a good handle on what the board went through this evening. Okay. So a motion by Mrs. Mahan, seconded by Mr. Diggins regarding the comments. All in favor say aye. Aye. Okay. So that is a unanimous vote, and I believe that disposes of article 4. Thank you very much, Ms. Waters. Thank you.</blockquote>
