<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome, I'm going to order this meeting of the Arlington Select Board on March 4th, 2024. I am Select Board Chair Eric Helmuth. Tonight's meeting is being conducted in a hybrid format consistent with provisions in state law for remote participation in public meetings. Before we begin, please note the following. This meeting is being conducted in the Select Board Chambers and over Zoom. It is being recorded and simultaneously broadcasted on ACMI.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * Sarah Montague, Arlington Representative on Minuteman High School Committee</blockquote>

I'm pleased to welcome for our first agenda item, Ms. Sarah Montague, our Arlington representative on the Minuteman High School Committee, who has kindly agreed to come to us tonight and give us an update on the Minuteman. Welcome. Thank you. Nice to see you all in person, in real life again.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Montague - 464</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity. So for the benefit of the viewing public, I've prepared a couple of remarks to be as efficient as possible. So on February 7th, I sent you all an email to give you a high-level update of both where we are with the budget process, as well as the superintendent search. So I am on the finance subcommittee for Minuteman School Committee, and I have participated along with my colleagues in reviewing four versions of the budget. Al Toste, who is a member of the Town of Arlington Finance Committee, has been involved along the way. I've met him virtually. He's also been in our budget meetings. And he has submitted questions in advance that the interim superintendent and the business manager have addressed. They've addressed those in a PowerPoint presentation, which was sent to Al today, ahead of Monday's meeting with interim superintendent Kevin Mahoney, our business manager, and myself. So that's the status on that. There should not be any gotcha surprise moments. The other update is on the superintendent search. So since my email to all of you, I am really pleased to report that we have deliberated the three finalists. The whole process from beginning to end was highly collaborative. It included all the necessary stakeholders, parents, teachers. We had a search subcommittee that was comprised of some of my colleagues on the school committee, as well as select parents and teachers that raised their hand. The three candidates had town meetings at the school, which were recorded. So teachers and parents could go in person. They were also individually recorded. When each of the three candidates finished those town meetings, and they were uploaded to a secure portal where the parents and the teachers could then review them if they hadn't seen it, or review it again if they had any questions. And then we had an electronic form that captured people's submissions, comments, questions, concerns, whatever. So that's both teachers and parents. We deliberated with the three finalists. Those were recorded as well. It was totally in compliance with mass open meeting law. And we also recorded, in one week, we saw all three finalists in deliberation. At the end of that week, we uploaded those recordings onto the Minuteman School Committee site so that anyone that was not on the Zoom call or not in person with us at the school in Lexington could review. In that deliberation, we successfully selected one candidate. Individuals in the search committee, along with our chair, left the room, called her, made an offer. And I'm pleased to say that Heidi Driscoll, who is currently the assistant superintendent for the situate district, has accepted. And she also has technical VoTech experience. So we're in negotiations.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 18</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so very much. And I'll turn to the board for any questions or discussion. Mrs. Mahan.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 128</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First off, thank you to the chair and Ms. Montague for giving us that update. Look forward to future updates when applicable or necessary. Do you believe, and it's okay if we don't have an answer tonight, but come town meeting and when we get to budget night, and we usually have the dedicated night for Arlington schools and Minuteman, do you believe Ms. Driscoll will be there or Mr. Mahoney, or that's still being discussed, to present on behalf of Minuteman? And also answer the question, just as a heads up to whomever it is, it seems to come up pretty annually, Arlington students, and if there's a waiting list and what the status of that is for Arlington. But do you know yet who you anticipate?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Montague - 236</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm hearing a two-part question, so let me address the first part first. I don't recall the exact date of the town meeting. Do you know what the date is? It would probably be a Wednesday, second week in May, but don't hold me to that. It would probably be sometime in May. It could be the first week, second week. So part of our negotiation would be to ask Ms. Driscoll to spend time with the school and the interim superintendent. And so depending upon the timing of that and the town meeting in Arlington, it would either be Ms. Driscoll or Mr. Mahoney or a combination of two. He has the institutional knowledge that's so valuable. So that's part one. And then part two, we would probably be, I know that we'll be prepared to give you an update at that time of what the enrollment numbers are looking like. So the school sent out the acceptance notices. And then what happens is there's always a period of time where we might hear that some students changed their mind. So we should have a good handle of that. And then as you may recall, freshmen can come in and within the first couple of weeks, for whatever reason, maybe they want to join the other school soccer team, decide to go back and go to Arlington High School instead. So is that helpful?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 119</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. That's perfect. I just want to make sure that questions, since there's a couple of new people, although Mr. Mahoney has been with Minuteman for a while, so I'm sure he's aware that that question, especially now, which the good news is, it's the brand new school and the great curriculum and course offerings that I guess the good news would be that so many are applying to have a waiting list. So, but thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah. And I think that what I think what's great is there's great choices for all of our students in Arlington. There's Arlington High School and there's Minuteman. So I think it's a win-win for our citizens, frankly. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 74</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other questions? Any other? Mr. DiCorsi? Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ms. Montague, for the presentation tonight and for keeping us informed through the email. And just wondering, since you've been on the committee, you came in with a lot of knowledge about the district. We saw that during the interview process, but what, anything new you have learned that surprised you or reinforced your feelings about Minuteman since you began?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Montague - 151</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a really excellent question. I have an outstanding appreciation for both sides of the fence, if you will. Part of my training was to take the chart, the course forward, the chart forward. It's basically all of the educational requirements to be a school committee member. So I have a greater appreciation for mass open meeting laws. And I have my budget Bible. So I'm really trying to familiarize myself with what's been done in the past that has implications for the current day and moving forward. And I will say that the acronyms, you know, I come from the private sector, industry sector, and there's acronyms everywhere, right? So I don't want to think that an acronym I'm hearing relates to an acronym I know from a different part of my life. So having this and the glossary of terms and all of that is immensely helpful to me.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 88</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Just one other question. So it looks as if next year the projected enrollment will hit the maximum, the 698, I think is what the capacity of the building is. And so I know there's probably room on the margins, but is there any, has there been any discussion since you started about talking to other communities about possibly joining the district? Or is the feeling because of the member towns are taking up 98% of the seats, that's what it's going to be for a while?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Montague - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trend is the member towns are taking up and you'll be able to see that data conclusively in the documentation that Al Toste received today. Okay. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>

Any further comments? I guess I didn't, I didn't understand that answer. So is it the number of students in each number of town is taking up or the number of towns is taking up?
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Montague - 45</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the nine, the nine towns that are part of the district, we're seeing an, a trend over time where the towns that are eligible to send their students to Minuteman High School is trending upward. The non-participating towns in the district are trending downward.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth and Sarah Montague - 199</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. All right. That's, that's, that's what I thought your question is. So, so, so it's trending up. So you're at, you're at nine now and you're thinking there'll be a, so what is the number now? Nine? Nine towns are currently in the mix, right? With Arlington and Lexington being the two towns that have the highest number of students enrolled at Minuteman High School. Okay. And that's from this nine from what? So what was it like a couple of years ago? We have all the historic data. I don't have it memorized, but I'm happy to make sure that you all get a copy of it. Yeah. I was just trying to get a sense of the trend. That's all. Okay. We have 16 communities in our seven left with the new agreement. Okay. All right. So it's just a curiosity question. That's all. Yeah. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. No, that's okay. There's a lot of really rich history to this. There really is. All right. All right. Thank you. Thank you for the discussion. Thank you very much for coming. Thanks for your service. You're welcome. Thanks for the opportunity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * Laurie Bogdan Co-chair ACAC Community Engagement </blockquote>

All right. That brings us to the item three. We have three coming items for approval and we'll start with the storm drain mural painting project. We have Lori Bogdan. Good evening. And do we have anything to display on this? Sure. We'll bring some slides up in the upper monitor and show the people at home. Good evening.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. It's nice to be here. Thank you for having me. Great to have you. I'm Lori Bogdan and I live in East Arlington and I've been active for the last several years with the Arts Arlington Program. I'm the one that is in charge of the utility box painting project too, which I'm sure you've all enjoyed, I hope. And here we are with another idea for our town to enrich the town. And you had, thank you very much, in addition to what was in our packets, we had additional three sites that you wish to have approved. And so those are on the board's table tonight. They've also been added to NOVA's agenda for the public.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I just wanted to add, I think this is a great idea. Seems to be something that's well established in a number of places across the country. Should draw a good amount of attention to these locations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent. Thank you. And I'll turn to the board for discussion and motions. Mr. Dickens. I'm happy to move approval. You know, I, along with many others, we really enjoyed the utility boxes, you know, so, but I have a couple of questions. So, is there a problem in Arlington with stormwater from the drains?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 61</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do have a storm drain adoption program that they're trying to encourage. There's, along with dumping, which I don't think happens so much in this town, the drains get clogged often with leaves and other debris, and new to me, but when that goes down, the tannins and things with the leaves, that can also disturb the waterways in town.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins and Laurie Bogdan - 194</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, gotcha. So, despite whether there's a problem or not, I think it's really good. And we want to bring awareness to all the five waterways that we have. Right, right. And so, these sites are selected for their visibility? I, it's twofold. I want them to be visible, so at least people, pedestrians walking by, students going to school will see them and become aware of the program, you know, the issue that we have. And traffic and visibility, that's why I picked them. And they also have to be paintable. Yeah. So, the sidewalk that's near them has to be in okay condition. They'll vary. They won't all be square. You know, there are some triangular-shaped areas. So, I wanted a good variety of students. That's why you see in here, we might divide this into a two-year project, but some of them are at school, some are in the high-trafficked areas. And I also wanted to hit each section of town. Out of fairness, Arts Arlington likes to get cultural district, east, heights. Nice. Well, thank you. Thank you very much. And I'm still looking for a second. Second. Mr. Hurt?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 67</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. Any further discussion? I must say, the utility boxes are just a delight. And I love public art in general, but I love these. And I think you've done a fantastic job coordinating those. They look great. It's just a win-win. And I look forward to the extension of this. I think it's a really fun project and will bring some well-needed attention to our stormwater.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 36</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Where it goes. All right. So, on a motion by Mr. Diggins, seconded by Mr. Hurt. All in favor? Aye. Opposed? Five-nothing vote. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 12</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*  Heather Leavell, Director and Curator, Cyrus Dallin Art Museum </blockquote>

All right. We have item four. Patriot's Day celebration in Whittemore Park. Requested April 15th of this year by the Cyrus Dallin Art Museum. And do we have Ms. Lovell here or in Zoom to speak to this? Give me a chance. There we go. Yep. Excuse me. Give. There we go. Good evening, Ms. Lovell. You can turn your camera on if you wish and unmute yourself. Hi. Good to see you. Welcome. Hello. Hey, everybody. Just introduce yourself again and just briefly review your request.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Heather Leavell - 224</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I'm Heather Lovell. I'm the director of the Cyrus Dallin Art Museum. And our request is the use of Whittemore Park for April 15th from 9 to 1230. We're having a Patriot's Day celebration in the park. The actual event is from 10 to noon. And we are setting up around 9, 930 and probably will finish up around 1230. And it's free, family-friendly. We're going to have some poetry presentations. We have a member who will be reading Longfellow. Longfellow is Paul Revere's ride. And then we'll have another person read Cyrus Dallin's parody of Longfellow's poem about his battle to get the Paul Revere statue erected in Boston. And then we'll have some other folks talk about what it was like in Arlington in the 18th century and what they would have witnessed that day in 1775. And then after that, the museum will be open for tours. We have recently negotiated a three-year loan for a prototype of Cyrus Dallin's sixth model for the monument, which we have on view now at the museum. So people will be able to compare and contrast because we already have number five. So they'll be able to see them both together for the first time. And that's pretty much the gist of the event. Does anyone have any questions? Thank you very much.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd and Heather Leavell - 400</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, I think, is a terrific idea, especially for the day. And I will now turn to the board. Mr. Hurd. Thank you. Move approval. Look forward to the event. I'll actually likely be reading Longfellow's ride, Paul Revere's ride, about a block down around that same time that day. Yep. I don't know. This kind of falls in a whole crux of events that we have planned for that weekend for our Patriot's Day weekend. One of the events that we had kicked around that I think is still in process is a potential beer garden in Whittemore Park. It will be in the afternoon of that day after we do the event at Arlington, at Town Hall. I mean, I think we can kind of plan around that. I mean, assuming that they stick to the timeframe that's presented, it shouldn't be an issue unless I don't know if the town manager has any thoughts on it. But I think the plan was around 1 o'clock. I'm not sure what time they try to set up. But I mean... I'm again, I'm happy to approve this and we can kind of work around it But that was part of the events that we had planned both for this year and the following year I think we're looking at two beer gardens one on Saturday one on Monday with one be request being at the Historical Society at the Jason Russell house on Saturday and At Woodmore Park on Monday And again, it would be in the afternoon following the event at Town Hall, but Just to put that on the radar in the in the event that that one entity is not talking to the other You know, we have control that this board has approval control over Woodmore Park but certainly the Cyrus Dallin Museum is Right there as well and should know of the events that we have planned. So just throwing that out there We love to have events in the park and we're happy to co-promote pretty much anything that happens in the park That's a community event too. So it's good to know and we've been in touch with ATED about this coordinating with them But I hadn't heard about the beer garden. So there shouldn't be any conflict. We should be done by with the park We should be done by 11</blockquote>

This is on Dorothy Road At the southern southern edge southern end of Dorothy Road the purpose of the monitoring wells would be to provide a sort of objective reference point for Accurately measuring the groundwater levels In the in the immediate area It's I think everybody probably knows The groundwater levels are extremely important. It's extremely important to have accurate measurements in evaluating the proposed development and We are concerned that The measurements that have been provided by the developer Are not reliable and do not comply with State requirements So our goal would be to provide a reference point For the development of the proposed development Provide a reference point which would enable folks to evaluate the accuracy of the developers measurements the pipes the the wells would installing the wells is a pretty small matter Basically a matter of sinking six-inch PVC pipe The pipe would be flush with the ground so it wouldn't protrude and the pipe would have In in the pipe would be placed A piezometer, which is a pressure measurement device That that provides a reliable way of of determining groundwater levels So that's that's our ask That's our ask the Work would be done by Vitrana construction, which is a licensed bonded experience contractor and Would obviously be done under town supervision Thank you,</blockquote>

Mr. Horsley and that was one of his recommendations that he made back in november and more recently at the conservation commission meetings is For the applicant to install monitoring wells but I think the request here is is more of a a check within the right-of-way and like dorothy road is a public way that was approved accepted in 1939, so there is Um room for to put the wells, but if I could ask mr.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;um, we attached a diagram that Was was done. I'm not sure what consultant did it originally but it was in mr. Horsley's report and you can see a series of tp up to eight test pits on on the site and um What what's happening or what had happened as reported by mr Horsley is is there's a series of five test pits which would if approved there would be townhomes along dorothy road Test pits seven and eight are really where a lot of the the issues have arisen test pit seven in particular where? the data What's being reported? appears to be inconsistent with test pits in other areas and And what mr Horsley has has said very persuasively at the conservation commission meetings is when you have these inconsistencies and when some of your soil information Is inconsistent the best thing to do is to have monitoring wells And so at the last conservation commission meeting our request was made of the applicant To install wells at these sites particularly at test pit seven That area there which is shaded Is is a large infiltration system if the project the project is ever approved It's critical because that's where the groundwater seeps through back into to the soils but if they're If the groundwater level is too high and interferes with the infiltration system It won't work and there'll be widespread flooding and this this has been a major major issue and as I understand the land trust request and and mr. Elman still like you can um, Elaborate what you're really seeking to do here is have wells nearby Take a look at readings over a period of time because march april and may are your high Um groundwater months and just see how that compares and how that fluctuates to what's being reported. Is that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah test pit seven is really the the um, uh The place where where some of the problems with the measurements that have been conducted are clear That says that the groundwater level there is below sea level that minus 0.5 Says the groundwater level is below sea level. This is in our experts words Something he hasn't encountered in 30 years of measuring groundwater so yet, this is a measurement that the developer is is is relying on so um, uh, we think it's very important to have Continuously monitored wells. Um, not these not these point in time measurements, which the developer has taken Um in order to get a really accurate idea of seasonal high groundwater Thank you, and if I could the last thing i'd like to say I mean Given the significance of this issue one of the most important issues In this whole mugard development process. What's the groundwater level? How are we going to protect the area? Actual data is what's necessary. Yes And and again, this is what experts have said and and so anything that we can do To assist that within the the private way. I certainly am happy to support. So thank you. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman It's mrs. Mahan Thank you, um, i'll Definitely second that motion and um, just sort of a a process question. Um I'm probably correct that thorndike place their developers did their own wells and I don't know how much veracity or Question of veracity I would have on that Um, and I and I appreciate that the land trust is is um having I think you said vitrano come out and and uh Do a more appropriate study in terms of What the groundwater level is out there? I did not attend zoom in on the last conservation commission meeting Um, but I did mail my land trust renewal this morning Office um Thank you ms. Rowe for your extra special stationery, um, but my question is the process question would be um after may when the Results are compiled and compared which may go into june the process question would be am I correct that uh thorndike place had their own Consultant that did what they thought was adequate which we Myself and others think is woefully inadequate that this information will go to the conservation commission Um to be weighed against that Um, or which I anticipate the answer would probably be no um other developers of thorndike place sort of agreeing and acquiescing that this is something that should be done and they also Um will will stand by the results of this study afterwards Uh, whichever you want to I think one of the things the last conservation commission meeting the conservation commission Hasn't put in writing to the developer That the wells that one well needs to be closer to tp7 um It's really um, their existing wells are not placed. Well um That needs to be in writing to the developer The developer said that they'll respond once they get that right in writing I know this is a period of transition with dave morgan. Just david morgan just coming back today But um, we're hounding them Yeah, just to add to that, um, technically the developer has not um Put in place continuously monitored wells These t tp here stands for test pit And those are pits that were dug and one measurement was taken a one one on one day And then the test pit was closed up and the measurements that you see on this chart are are one day measurements and not um the results of continuous three-month monitoring I think that the conservation commission is going to request Um, the that the developers themselves conduct Do proper three-month monitoring wells, but given the um Uh kind of haphazard way that the developer has approached the groundwater measurement here We think it's important to have an objective external measurement um pretty much whatever happens and that will be The results of that measurement will be shared with the conservation commission and the developer, you know We our goal is to be completely above board and in presenting the data to everyone um a test pit is is Basically a hole in the ground. It rarely goes um below 12 inches or 18 inches A monitoring well is usually at least three feet deep So in a week like this when there's going to be a lot of rain It's a very different kind of reading and that's why the monitoring wells That we're proposing and also that the town um should be fussing about um need to be in place Thank you,</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mr. Chair, sorry about that happy to support it too, you know And and looking forward to the the study itself at that point, you know, i'll probably have some questions, you know And i'll i'll be on the phone With you to save everyone here time. It'll just be mostly a whole bunch of curiosity questions about the the methodology, you know, is the Is there a report that comes with that is there a report that comes with that, uh Table or there there was one. Um, but that's the test pits not the monitoring wells It is in some of the information that they've put before the monitoring well The monitoring wells were not monitored as it Probably they probably haven't been monitoring them, right? So we haven't seen any data, right? Lately, right. I didn't see any from last spring We need to see some for this spring. I understand. I understand. I mean, i'm just kind of curious as to be what They've written up with respect to this. So if I go to a com com meeting agenda, I can okay great. I'll I'll look I was just looking at the last meeting and I didn't see it wasn't obvious to me But I'll look around some more, you know, so well These water issues are complicated And it's not that we're smarter or anything My son called me today he had a sight problem and he sent me pictures he said what should I do here mom?

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chair. I would just ask if as the board considers this proposal Obviously there's a baseline requirement that the contractor perform a dig safe And mark it out so we can ensure there are no conflicts with underground utilities But I think thinking longer term when whenever the time comes that the wells no longer Have any value or serve a purpose that the land trust be ultimately responsible for helping They be decommissioned or abandoned in place. So there's no future confusion about what exists under that access hatch that will be Installed at grade What we would do is take off the top take the um thing that I can't pronounce And then Put in um, you know gravel Fresh stone And mr. Gorsuch. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to say one other thing this Vote and what we're being asked to approve right now. The conservation commission has jurisdiction Over what is a notice of intent that the applicant has filed This is not an attempt by the board to interfere with that process at all What it is is a request to get more information surrounding the site The more data the better, but we certainly respect the work that the conservation commission is doing. They have jurisdiction over the site They're making their own requests. So Just to be clear to the public. This isn't us trying to interfere in that process It's responding to the request here and I I actually called david morgan today To sort of inform because it's his first day back poor man To inform him what the land trust was trying to do and to talk to him about it. So there wasn't any confusion Thank you. Yeah, thank you for that clarification And uh, you know, I will happily pile on with my support I think this really speaks to one of the very core reasons why this board in the town has had such deep concern about this Proposal from the very beginning and that is the potential to make the the flooding problem And so, you know, I think that I really applaud the initiative shown by the land trust and the neighbors to get better data, as Mr. DeCorsi said. So I think we're ready for a vote on a motion to approve by Mr. DeCorsi and seconded by Mrs. Mahan. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. Thank you both very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. And I think we can take the map down. Here we go. I love test pits now. I'll be dreaming about those tonight.

I'm Ken Lubar. We are pleased to have you. If you could just introduce yourself and just say a few words about your interest in serving. We do have your materials, and we're grateful to have read those. Sure.

I know the joys and pains of living in a historic house, and I'm cognizant of, you know, maintaining historic houses and maintaining historic neighborhoods. Interested in it, don't have a formal education background, but have been studying it, participated and listened into a lot of the historic district meetings, excited about it, and think I could provide some insight into it. Happy to answer any questions.</blockquote>

On top of everything else that you're doing in there, according to your resume, CV, and it's interesting, last meeting and this meeting, we kind of see a common theme with the Trustees of Reservation and the Appalachian Mountain Club, there's sort of a lot of crossover, but I think there's great expertise for people who are affiliated with those organizations that the town can benefit from, and I kind of chuckled. I do not, nor have I ever lived in a historic home, but have many friends who do, and I think it's not a requirement, but it certainly is an extra benefit you have sort of bringing that experience there with you. And obviously, you've had some interface with the Historic District Commission to date as a homeowner, but I assume you're also have been attending sort of ad hoc or? I have attended meetings, I've applied, I've been for various changes to our house, I've listened in on other meetings, both in the neighborhood and elsewhere. So I've been a, not a hardcore attendee, but an occasional attendee and hope to hit 100% of this record at the meetings. Thank you.</blockquote>

So I think you will bring me that kind of diversity to the commission, you know. But you had me at this line, you know, however, the urge to preserve everything and freeze the past needs to be carefully balanced with the concerns of creating more affordable housing and, oops, more affordable, sorry, I lost my place, you know, and the reality of maintaining historic residences, you know. So for me, you get it, you know. So we do have to maintain that balance, you know, and you appreciate that and I appreciate someone who appreciates that. So thank you.</blockquote>

I recommend Ken's very thoughtful letter to us that's available in the Select Board Agenda's minutes and page and I guess I'm just going to sponsor that tonight to promote that for the public. But that's where all the good stuff is. But I really do appreciate that sensitivity to, yes, you have to fulfill your mission and that's the purpose of the historic districts, but there are realities of the housing market that we desperately need and especially for affordable housing and, as you say, the realities of maintaining the houses. So I'm glad to know that you go into this as a lover of historic architecture and of history, but also as a homeowner. Yes. So I encourage you to continue with that passionate passion for that balance.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 687</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. So with this particular establishment located at 1323 Mass Ave., I understand there was a change of ownership that took place sometime on or about December of 2022 or January of 2023. At that point in time, the new owner had applied for a certificate of occupancy from Inspectional Services. They had also applied for a permit to operate a food establishment from the Arlington Health Department and the establishment had also sought or applied for initially an application for a common vitular's license at the select board's office. I understand that shortly thereafter, the establishment was placed for a hearing in February of 2023, at which point the applicant did not appear for their hearing and, frankly, the common vitular's license, therefore, was never technically granted. However, the establishment has stayed in operation since that time and shortly after the new year following our renewal period when it was learned that, you know, the common vic license, as we know, it had not technically been issued, select board staff, again, shortly after the new year, began reaching out to the owner to request an updated application material and to schedule a hearing with this board. Unfortunately, the materials weren't submitted in as timely a manner as would be hoped for. Inspectional Services then became involved and started issuing formal letters saying, you know, frankly, this, you know, you need to obtain this license and if you don't, you know, it could lead to issues with your Certificate of Occupancy. So after a few rounds of contact with the applicant, again, the applicant appeared at the select board office and submitted a revised application for the common vitular license and on Friday of last week, signed for the departmental inspection reports that were included with the select board's packet for this meeting. And I would note that nearly each department that submitted an inspection report for this establishment did notice items that were not in compliance, save for the police department who represented no issues. With respect to the fire department, one caveat that I will note that was perhaps not known at the time the fire department prepared that inspection report was that a routine mercantile inspection was conducted by AFD in December of 2023. No violations were noted at that time. I know the inspection report references no inspection since 2021. That was simply a lag in that inspection report finding its way into the software that the fire department uses. But with that being said, the inspection that was conducted would not necessarily meet the same criteria of the inspection that the fire department would conduct for a change of ownership. So that item remains outstanding. There are a few issues with, as noted in the inspectional services report, with signage at the establishment being out of compliance with the town of Arlington's zoning bylaws. So those items remain to be addressed. And then finally, I would note the health department similarly in their report noted that they have been conducting a number of inspections at this establishment since it received its permit to operate at the sort of start of calendar year 2023 and have noted a number of serious but also repeat violations. And in reviewing that report with the director of public health in advance of this meeting, I did learn that the board of, excuse me, the health department has been in touch with the applicant and scheduled an administrative hearing to be held on March 7th with respect to the ongoing repeat and critical violations at this establishment, at which point they would likely enter into some sort of plan that involved close monitoring, outside consultancy, and just developing a path and a plan to bring the establishment into compliance with the food code. And I would say that sort of sums, you know, where we've been and then also where we're at today. And I think that the board, you know, if they sought a recommendation, I think there's a few things that I would advise the board to consider this evening. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 357</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, as I looked at the inspection reports here, and given the history, this is a unique situation in terms of the licensing not, or a license not being granted a year ago. I see a number of things in the reports, and it seems to me that just to be absolutely clear, it seems like something's going to happen this Thursday with the Board of Health. There's an inspection that the fire department would like to undertake at some point, and there's also an issue with your signs. It seems to me, given where things are and what needs to be done, I'd be inclined to continue this hearing until March 18th, but just maybe after the meeting or tomorrow, ask you to either work through our board, maybe through the town manager's office, so that everybody is in agreement as to what needs to be done in order for you to have this license renewed or to receive this license, because there's a number of things. And unlike the last restaurant that was here, every one of the inspection reports was okay. They checked all the boxes, that the fire department had been out, they'd done the inspection. The health department didn't have any issues. There's no sign issues. Here, there are issues. I don't think it would be appropriate to vote up or down on the license tonight, but I think the next two weeks are critical so that if you come back, if the board is so inclined, if you come back in two weeks, we know exactly where things stand with the inspection reports, and hopefully you're in compliance at that point, because I will tell you, without that being addressed, it may be difficult for this board to go ahead with the next step on the license. I would move for a continuance until March 18th, and maybe with a request to Mr. Champa to extend that temporary certificate of occupancy through the date of our meeting, so there's no issue in terms of that expiring on the 15th, and our meeting being the following Monday.</blockquote>

I got you. Yeah, I think I want to, before I turn to the rest of my colleagues, I want to emphasize, and I actually ask the town's attorney a question to be clear, that notwithstanding that this common vigilance license was not pursued last year, and the restaurant has been operating, am I correct in my understanding that it is not legal right now, that there's not, it's not, there's not, well, correct me in the right language, but right now, you're not supposed to be operating a restaurant without this license, is that correct, Attorney Cunningham?</blockquote>

Under the provisions of Chapter 140, Section 19 through 21, establishments are required to have this common vigilance license to serve food or drink, so technically, they are in violation right now, and fines could be issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I just want to make that point. I think that, you know, speaking for myself as a board member, we're inclined to give you these two weeks in recognition that, you know, this has been going on for a year, but it is, it is not legal to operate the restaurant without this license. So in two weeks, I think, I would support Mr. Ducoshi's motion, I won't formally second it, but, you know, if this were to carry, I think that the, what's really important important is that in two weeks, these problems need to be solved and there needs to be criteria I think the board would want to spell out tonight in order for us to, at least for Mr. Gorsy and I, to vote for that license. I think after that point, if the board does not issue that license, you cannot operate the restaurant. So that's how important this is to me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Herd? Yeah, I'll second the motion and just say that, I mean, I hope you are understanding how important it is to take this board's recommendation and the town staff's and the town department's that you work with, because there's nothing that we like to see less than repeat violations and when we see someone comes out and tells you you're a violation and then they come back and you're still in violation, that's a very quick way to lose your business. Yep. I just want to make, it seems like over the last year, this hasn't been a priority, but you have to make sure if you want to continue to operate in this town, that you are making what, everything that is told to you about this business, a priority and making sure that you continue to be in compliance, because even if you get the license in two weeks, if you're not continuing to work with the Board of Health and doing what they're saying, then you're not going to be able to operate your business.</blockquote>

You have, I'm sorry? I have just email. Okay. Yes. Well, you need to get in contact with someone from the town tomorrow, if you haven't already, but maybe like a double check, email tomorrow, because you have three different departments that you need to with the building inspector. So four things to tick off. So if you can contact someone, email tomorrow, and find out exactly which of these four things you have to get done with the fire department, with the signage planning department, with the Board of Health, and then the building inspector.</blockquote>

So you need to contact tomorrow, email, or you can call and just say, what are the four things I have to do? I have to do, yeah. I'll give you that information, whether it's a phone call or email, so that you'll be able to come back. Fine. Two weeks. Yeah. So there's three different parts of the town, three different departments that things signage, food, and the Board of Health, and the fire department. I got you. So if you could just- Where's the first one, sorry? First one? Pardon me? Signage, first one? We have a signage zoning bylaw, so that's under the planning department, and they'll let you know what you need to do to make sure your signs, your signage, are under the law, the bylaw that we have. So it can be fixed, but you have to contact everyone, and they need to work with you. I got you. So when you come back in two weeks, those three departments and the building inspector, that will be all. I got you. So you can be ready to do business, and you don't have to worry, well, you'll always worry, but. Yes. Okay. So tomorrow, you'll contact someone from the town, either phone call or email, and we'll make sure you get all that other info, okay? I got you. Thank you. I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure.

Although we're here for the discrete issue of the application of the common VIC license, the board's consideration of the other actions of other town boards and commissions is entirely appropriate, and this board can consider the totality of the circumstances when coming to a decision on this very discrete issue of the application of the common VIC license. So the board's, I guess, informing the applicant correctly that they can consider these other issues when making a decision on your application.</blockquote>

I'm going to have a hard, hard time voting yes, I mean, in two weeks, given the pattern of behavior, especially the food safety. As Mr. Hurd said, I mean, the repeated violations, I mean, are the killer on this, I mean, especially with food. I mean, we don't tolerate, you know, repeats on alcohol, but food, I mean, food safety, from what I gather, I mean, it's very serious issues, I mean, and so, and, I mean, I don't know how it happened that you went so long without the common VIC license, I mean, I think we partly have to look at ourselves, I mean, but it's just, I just have a real bad feeling about this, you know, I mean, and then when I look at the maintenance program, I mean, it's, there's really nothing to it, which to me just kind of shows a lack of attention to detail, which is really important, you know, in this kind of business, I mean, so I'll go ahead with it, but I don't know if I'm going to get to yes, I mean, in two weeks, because it seems like we'll have to, like, monitor you for, like, I don't know how long, and then when we stop monitoring you, my sense is that we'll find you in violation again, I mean, and so, so that's where I am.

So, so I think, thank you for your patience tonight and for coming tonight. I think it's really important that you understand that you'll come back in two weeks, but from what I, from listening to my other board members, my colleagues here, it sounds to me that you will not, unless all these problems are fixed, that this board is unlikely to grant the license and you would have to close the business.

No, I'm going to do it for, you know, for, I never, for, I have two business for, I always going to do it for, because I don't, it's not played for, you know. Yeah, so we want you to succeed. Yes. You know, we want you to be able to keep the business open to serve the community. Yes, of course. But I think I will echo Mr. Diggins remarks that particularly the health department memo is very concerning to me that they cited repeat foundation and priority violations that continued as late as late in January. So those must be addressed and there must be a plan in place that's acceptable to the, to the health department as well as addressing the sign problems and addressing the fire department inspection as well. All that needs to happen within the two weeks. Yep. I got you. Okay, good. Any other comments from the time manager or attorney?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Sheriff, I could just add one thing is it relates to the signage violations with respect to the two week timeframe. You know, when we're in touch likely sometime tomorrow, what I see the appropriate action being for that two week period of time is actually the removal of the violative signs as they stand and the submission of an application for any new signs. It's unlikely that any applicant would be able to proceed all the way through that process within two weeks. But what I would deem compliance with respect to the March 18th meeting would be all of the offending signs have been removed or those that are not in compliance with the bylaw in at least a submission of an application for new signs and then it could proceed through the process. But that's what I would deem as, you know, appropriate compliance for March 18th. Thank you.</blockquote>

Of course. In the advancement of those objectives. And if Mr. Chair, if I could add to that, at the administrative hearing that is scheduled for March 7th at 10 a.m., it would be expected that some sort of corrective action plan will be devised between health department staff and the proprietor of the establishment and that will generate, you know, essentially a record that will be able to be shared with the board.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's start with Article 7, the proposed bylaw amendment and a betterment bylaw revision. And I'll take it to leave it to Mr. Feeney and team to make the presentation.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 850</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, you know, this article obviously was inserted at my request, but was intended on sort of addressing a few discrete issues that have arisen with respect to different betterment projects that have arisen, at least over the course of the past year. The first of which, and there may be even some representatives from the Tower Heights Association I understand that wish to speak to it, but that was an issue that was flagged by select board staff when a prior project was considered, is that, you know, there are times when a certain grouping of streets, maybe two or three roads within a much larger association may be wishing to pursue a betterment for which they are abutters. But as currently written, our bylaw would require a two-thirds threshold vote for each and every household that makes up that association, and that could be hundreds or a couple hundred households when in fact you're just trying to advance a project that, you know, may impact 10 or 20 households. So to be frank, it makes the amount of legwork that's required for the petitioners almost time and cost prohibitive to, you know, certainly seek out, you know, votes of everyone in that association, frankly for a project that may not impact them in their household. So the proposed changes as written work to address that and have it only be pertinent for abutters for whom are going to benefit from the betterment project. And then secondly, this board may recall that the past few betterment projects that have been petitioned for have been subject to some varying requirement based on the varying level of funding. As of right now, our betterment bylaw requires that a one-third deposit or upfront share be collected for each betterment project. The change being proposed is to flip that to be a two-third deposit to match the sort of two-thirds threshold for folks who need to vote favorably on advancing the petition. And what that would do would allow the town through the board to better project the cash flow and establish a deeper pipeline of the number of projects that can be addressed each construction season. And I tried to address that in the or illustrate that in the materials that were put forth in your packet. In looking at the four projects that we potentially have in the pipeline for the 2024 construction season and the total dollar value of those projects being just shy of $350,000. If the town were needing to remain providing a 67% share for that project, we would need to have just over $230,000 in the bank to approve those projects. Or conversely, if the town only had to guarantee provision of a one-third share for those projects, we would need to have approximately $115,000 to spend. And if we project what our possible funding would be for the 2024 construction season, we have an unencumbered fund balance of $27,000 as of last week. And then we are proposing to again cede the private way fund with a $100,000 warrant article appropriation at this spring's annual town meeting. meeting, which we did for fiscal year 22, but as you can see, those funds, given the higher cost of the projects and the number of projects that are being brought before the board are not lasting many, many years as they had done before. So all that to say, you know, if this bylaw change was looked upon favorably by the board and ultimately town meeting, given the funding that we would have available for the 2024 election season, it would put the board in a position, at a minimum, to approve all four of the potential betterment projects for 2024. So what I also did was, working with select board office staff, pull up the data from the past three years of our experience with private way betterment projects to demonstrate that, in fact, we are seeing a trend towards higher collection rates up front that actually would, at a minimum, meet, but in most instances exceed that which is being proposed for a 67% collection rate. So trying to demonstrate that, in fact, it may not have a meaningful impact necessarily on the abutters with what they are generally paying up front as it is so it doesn't get assessed over the course of five years with interest being charged and potentially impacting someone's escrow payments that people generally are moving towards paying up front, but that in having that sort of up front payment rate or collection guaranteed, then, as we try to look at these projects on a season-by-season basis, we can better project when someone, if they're willing, able, and looking to do one of these betterment projects, we can project which season their project would be able to fall into so that it's not as reactive as it's been over the course of the sort of past year trying to determine if and when the town may be able to support a given betterment project. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. And could you, one of you, address the also proposed addition in Section 6 under assessment costs that would add the words, the deposit requirement shall not apply to petitions or alternate petitions for repairs to private ways to be financed by the town through an instrument of borrowing or debt issuance?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 306</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. I'm happy to address that, Mr. Chair. That was verbiage that I had drafted in trying to think about an instance where that two-third deposit threshold could potentially serve as a barrier to a betterment project. I thought about potentially some sort of massive project that could be advanced by one of our largest associations, maybe a Kelowna Manor or some larger share of the Tower Heights Association where you could get a project cost that is going to be on the order of magnitude of hundreds of thousands of dollars or potentially a million dollars. That would rise to the level of significance where the private way fund would never actually be able to support that as a cash payment, and, in fact, we would need to borrow those funds. And through the Department of Revenue, if those funds are borrowed and if those betterment assessments are paid through someone's taxes, those receipts can be specifically reserved by the town for the payment of the debt service associated with that borrowing or whatever the instrument or obligation was. So for a project of that nature, in fact, the upfront payment or the cash flow is not as critical to the town because a separate borrowing would be conducted. So I was trying to think ahead to not create some other preventative or more barrier issue in the future that might require an association to come up with, you know, half a million dollars up front when it may not be necessary because we would be borrowing those funds. And despite not being able to establish an enterprise fund for this purpose, when it falls under a borrowing and it's for the, you know, the debt service, that we would be able to reserve those receipts and use them to directly pay the borrowing costs.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 234</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah. Thank you for that. I'll just further note for the public's benefit that the town manager was referencing a table which was provided in the published agenda, a very helpful one that shows the upfront collection rate for recent projects. And I'll note that the average of that was 81% of projects going back to 2020. So the average has been 81% of the costs have been actually collected up front. The range is from 67% all the way up to 93%, actually. So I'll stop there. I just wanted to kind of get that out there for clarity. So I think I will do the hearings is first see if the board members have any questions to clarify the scope of this, then I'll suggest open it up for public comment, and then I'll return to the board for further discussion and motions, if that's okay with my colleagues. All right. So any initial questions from the board to further elucidate? Okay. That was quick. So let's now turn to the public. And I think we may have some people in the room who'd like to come up to the table and speak to this. And if you are on Zoom, please raise your hand in Zoom if you want to speak to this warrant article. Good evening. So just introduce yourself and your place of residence and make your comments.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Ross - 423</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Thank you. And I appreciate your considering these changes to these articles. My name is John Ross. I live in Arlington Heights on Stevens Terrace, and I'm a board member of the Arlington Heights Tower Association. And I just have a question about the last discussion regarding the two-thirds requirement of the upfront money and the, I guess, what you were describing as the someone's able to put their costs, what would be attributed to them into their taxes over the course of five years. So does that, if I'm explaining this properly, account for, like if someone commits to doing that, is that part of that two-thirds then? Is that for accounting purposes? How does that work? So what you're describing as the assessment or the special assessment for the betterment would actually be not part of the one-third now or potentially two-third deposit. So the two-thirds is the amount of money that's going to be collected via upfront payments. And the folks who defer making an upfront payment then have that special assessment placed onto their taxes, and it is paid over the course of five years. Okay. So regardless of the overall cost, if it's still half a million dollars, for example, I'm sorry, because I just didn't quite catch how that works in the two different scenarios. So is it? Does it vary with the amount that somebody would pay in terms of the two-thirds upfront if they chose or were not able to do that? It's two-thirds upfront of the total project cost. And then the following third is financed over the course of five years. Yes. So again, just looking at the total project cost and what needs to be collected as a minimum upfront, what we're proposing is two-thirds of the total project cost. And that may be some combination of some abutters not making any upfront contribution, as may be the case, and more likely a number of abutters making a full 100 percent upfront contribution because they choose not to have it assessed over time. But the proposal is to make sure that two-thirds of the project cost is being collected upfront and not being apportioned on people's taxes over time. But that is not by household, but with respect on the aggregate to the total project cost. Total amount. Okay. All right. Thanks. I think I understand that. Other changes made to the warrant articles, I think they're appropriate, and I'm on board with that. So thank you very much for that.</blockquote>

Twenty-five miles, of which something like two miles, I think, are in the Arlington Heights Tower Association. It's almost 300 homes. And so, as referenced earlier, you know, if it's a block or two, you know, with, you know, 10 or 20 or 30 houses on it, that's, you know, a very different ratio of the number of residents that you'd need to get approval from. So, it's kind of outgrown, that the association is coming up on 100 years old, so it's sort of outgrown the initial bylaws, and that this will make it a lot easier, especially as, well, a lot of the general infrastructure continues to age, that the Tower Association has been there to sort of put Band-Aids on these streets over time, but the Band-Aids only last so long, and there's going to have to be some more long-lasting improvements, so that the number of households that would have to approve it would make things a lot easier to get that done. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know we're supposed to have questions before, but if questions is part of my comments. I just want to clarify, because we've done a number of these, and I don't know if we've ever really got into the nitty-gritty of the law when we take these applications, and so I know there's obviously a two-thirds vote, two-thirds of the voters that needed to move the application forward, and it was always my understanding that everyone for every household one-third was due for the project to be moved forward, but are you saying that some residents can choose to put up nothing and just have the whole amount on their tax bill? They don't have to put up the one-third?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 44</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct. The bylaw is silent on requiring that contribution from every household, because if you think about the folks who may have voted no on the petition, if they withheld their one-third, you could actually keep the private way betterment from ever moving forward.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 194</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Yeah. Well, my other question is going to be, how do you enforce that one-third if it's a requirement that each person come up with one-third? That makes the warrant article . . . I'm 100 percent on board with the change regarding the neighborhood association, that makes sense. It makes the two-thirds . . . that new information makes the two-thirds more palatable for me. My concern with the two-thirds was that in the event that someone that was financially not in a position to pay upfront costs, how would that affect their ability . . . neighborhood relations, for one thing, but how that would affect them. But if there's still an option for someone that doesn't have the ability to come up with the upfront costs, it would just be a weighted average, right, so other neighbors would have to essentially come up with 100 percent of the cost in order to move forward. I mean, I'd still . . . I get the intent. I'm still a little weary about two-thirds. I think it's a big jump from one-third, but I'll listen to my colleagues, I guess. Mr. Gorsuch.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I . . . and I appreciate the changes to group of private ways. I do have a question I may talk to Attorney Cunningham after our vote. With the change in Section 4, I'm not sure Section 5 is necessary any longer because you're talking about it butters, but we can talk about that after the fact. I totally get the intent. We saw what the challenge was when you have a group of private ways voting on something, so I'm fine with voting in favor of that for now and then maybe having a discussion. I do have a similar concern on Section 6, and in talking to some neighbors, I live in Kellyn Manor, and the individual in Kellyn Manor who's responsible for the roads is Mr. Jacquard, and we talked about it a little bit recently. And a couple things, one, given the history where you're getting over two-thirds anyway, I understand increasing it from a third. I grow concerned that if we're over 50 percent, it may have a negative impact on the vote, that people will see the two-thirds right from the beginning, and there may be an issue. And let's face it, people who live on private ways, there is a sensitivity to paying for road betterment because it's just been the way it is. People say, I pay the same taxes, but I have to pay for this, and we're past that. I think people understand it when they come before us. But I think seeing two-thirds, even if it's a total project, I just am concerned that we're increasing this threshold where we're hitting the higher number anyway, and I'd throw it for discussion to the Board, maybe using 50 percent. And I get going from one-third to 50, because there is a situation that if everybody followed the one-third, there'd be an issue in terms of the number of roads that can be repaired, and the actual experience suggests that 50, we're always hitting that anyway. But I am concerned about going to two-thirds, so I'd be curious to see what other members think of that.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 99</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the impact is really timing for project planning purposes, because I think we can all agree the data shows that the collections will reach that level anyways. But if we take sort of Old Ham Road, or perhaps the last one we considered, which was, I believe, one of the Montague streets. We don't know when we would actually be able to authorize that project until that project is said and done, and until every final bill is issued in some number of weeks or months past to see exactly how people are going to proceed with payment.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 231</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you could approve one project, and we may not know until the very end of that construction season what the collections are necessarily going to be at a minimum. So in effect, you know, I would agree with Mr. DeCorsi that we know what we're going to collect, but it's a matter of knowing that up front when you're going to be approving a project, or at the start of construction season, versus having to wait until a project is completed, billed, and then seeing what it is that homeowners ultimately end up paying into the fund to know what could then be contributed to the next project. So it could just push, you know, projects further back, as we had seen with Oldham and others who say, okay, if you can meet this down payment threshold, then we can approve and, you know, you can proceed on this date. Otherwise, you'd have to wait for July 1 of calendar year 2024, or at least July 1 of calendar year 2025, and we might have to find a way to, you know, if we've only been able to effectively see this account with $100,000, we might have to find other years where we could potentially appropriate two, three, four, or even, you know, maybe $500,000 to have the adequate bandwidth to fully approve every project that's coming before the board.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 72</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think in response, I would say really any increase in the guaranteed down payment will just provide more stability and clarity as to how far the town, through the board, can stretch the dollars that live within the private way account at that point in time, because it gives clarity to what will take place, even when the project is done, because you will have collected that money up front.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 249</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my recollection probably isn't the best, and I don't think I have a really big sample size because, you know, I've been on the board for less than all but one person, you know, so, but my sense, though, is that the resistance that I hear to the betterments are more like they just don't want their roads to get faster. Now maybe those who don't sign up are resisting on funds, you know, let me rephrase that. Those who we don't hear from are maybe resisting, I mean, on affordability, but usually I'm hearing that people like me, we like our roads slow. If you make it better, it will be faster and less safe. So I hear your concerns, but I don't know if that's going to be a big factor in making it harder for people who want betterments to get it, but once again, I don't think that is, it's certainly not a scientific study, so that's all. I would just respond, just, I don't think in any betterment here, and I'm not talking about anyone specifically, but I don't think anyone has come up and just said they didn't want to pay, so sometimes, I think, I mean, I think generally people would like better roads, and I don't know. I would say that the argument that repaving the road makes it less safe is something that you hear just in lieu of someone saying that they don't wanna pay for their impediment.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 478</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Mrs. Mahon. The question at hand regarding the 2 3rds or 67% or 50%, I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage because I've never lived on a private way or had a close collaboration, association, you know, with the Tower Association, with Kellyn Manor, or upper end, lower end of Montague. So part of me was thinking, okay, if you look at the numbers from 2020 to current, we're getting 2 3rds anyways. But then I also understand that compiled in that, when I looked at those numbers, it's not that all the neighbors are giving 2 3rds, it's, you know, anywhere something over 50% are paying 100% upfront. So that's where, so, cause when I first saw that, I was saying, well, everybody's already paying 2 3rds. Well, it's not that. Some are taking the option of having something assessed to all assessed five years on the tax bill. And then there's someone similar to my husband that would say, well, I'm just paying it all upfront. I don't want it on the tax bill. I don't want to, I don't know if there's interest to be paid and things like that. So I was fine with the 2 3rds, but I just, and I'm not saying this in a sarcastic way or anything, it's just, I have nothing to draw upon. But the point that if we have 2 3rds, 67% versus one half, 50% it could be an impediment that if someone sees the 2 3rds number, that it would make harder for the petitioners, the association, et cetera, to get the necessary support to apply. I guess my thing is, what do we weigh? Being able to better financially plan so more streets can get in the queue and get done more expeditiously if you go with the 2 3rds or the 50%. So I'm fine with either number. I mean, I was okay with the 2 3rds, but if those who have been through the process feel that going out, doing the groundwork, seeing the 2 3rds number is gonna make it so much harder or perhaps to the detriment of the project, they think the 50% is better, I'd really, so I'm still going back and forth on it. I was all set for 2 3rds, but if that's the case, I'm fine with doing 50% and then there's nothing, we don't have a two-year rule that there's nothing precluding us that if we did a 50% that if the following year we decided to say, okay, we can now put it up to 2 3rds, we can do that legally. Mr. Chair? Yes, Ms. Mott. Mr. Chair. So I'd like to see either Mr. DiCorsi or Mr. Hurd or even Mr. Diggins, but I'm not prepared to make the motion. I'll go with whatever you think is best.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good. I'll make a couple of remarks as well to either add to the discussion, we'll see if it's constructive. As Mr. Ames mentioned, I happen to also be a board member of the Tower Association and I'll disclose that just because this applies to any resident of any private way, it's not a particular matter of the association, so I don't feel there's a conflict, but it does inform my own work. I'd actually like to invite Mr. Ross to speak, if you have any thoughts about this, because I believe, sir, you've helped organize an attempt at a project on your street and a couple of others that was one of the circumstances that sort of led to the awareness, the town manager's awareness that we needed to fix the association, but do you have a view based on your recent organizing, the extent to which if you told people that we gotta all together, all of us have to put two-thirds up front versus one-third up front, how much of a difference that would make in the circumstances that you've been in?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Ross - 380</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank you, so you're exactly right, so we underwent, myself and some of my colleagues, neighbors, trying to get a handful of streets to be essentially rebuilt, because they're in dramatic disrepair, and so it's gonna be pretty expensive. We calculated the number of streets, well, the three streets we had sort of collected together. In the end, the cost, and we put it out for, we got three different bids, and it was gonna be about $5,000 per household, and we got good agreement, almost 100% of everyone that we actually talked to was on board with wanting to go forward, but the complication was the way the bylaws were written, we couldn't do all three streets together, but I think, as far as the two-thirds versus one-third versus half, I like the idea that someone can put the whole thing onto their, basically finance it through their taxes over the course of five years. I think getting everyone to commit to at least one-third was somewhat of a higher bar versus someone that doesn't wanna pay anything can be like, okay, I'll put it on my taxes versus the other people that will pay 100%, so I think not having to require someone to pay even a third up front can help people, because there's people that have lived in this neighborhood for their whole lives, and they're on their fixed income, and they don't have, frankly, $5,000 to just shell out, and so I think that helps in that respect. The two-thirds is still pretty high, and when I did see that when I was reviewing the documents yesterday, the day before, that did give me some pause. We can probably manage it. I think if it's going to be the difference between, yeah, we can't even do the project for another couple years because the town can't commit to having that much money to finance. I'd rather have the two-thirds commitment than delay it for another couple years. 50% is better if we can manage 50%, and we can maybe the next year put more money into the pot and revisit the 50 to seven, there are two-thirds, so I mean, I'm not being very helpful because I'm wavering, but that's sort of my perspective.</blockquote>

Thank you for that, and it's a little unconventional, but we had somebody in the room who has been through this so we could get some perspective on that. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks, I appreciate it, and it is, you know, the neighbors are good. Everyone sees the condition of the roads, and so we want it done, but it's expensive. Okay, so I think at this point, I want to see if my colleagues want to make a motion. I will just say for myself, I have a similar tension, and I think that I have a great sympathy for the town manager's instincts towards predictability and financial, and then I also, as somebody who has helped organize these, do have some concerns about just the optics and how much that'll sort of affect getting the vote of if people feel like, oh, we all have to put this up, you know, even if you explain that it's an aggregate, so, you know, I could probably go their way on it as well. I'll also say, too, just getting a motion on the table, I have a technical question or two about the language, too, that I might offer as a friendly amendment when we get there, but it's less substantive.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question, can I ask a question before the motion? Yeah, yeah, of course. Okay, so there's the notion that we could go from 50 to 2 3rds, you know? I mean, we could also go 2 3rds to 50, right? You know, so if we decide, if we went to 2 3rds, and we said, this isn't working out for a reason, we could come down to 50, I imagine. So, but I guess there's kind of, like, the issue of, is it really as easy to come down as it is to go up, or is it really as easy, you know, to go up? I mean, once you start at a lower level, I mean, I could imagine it's harder to come down once you go up, but maybe you could speak to that, Mr. Manager?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Diggins. You know, I'm not sure I would have, you know, a strong inclination one way or the other. Obviously, you know, going up or down, it would just take a subsequent vote of, you know, select board, and then ultimately town meeting to make some further adjustment to the bylaw. But I think what we're really, right, like you're, the board's just trying to strike a balance between ensuring that the town has adequate funds to support these projects that are coming forward with greater frequency, and not having to turn people away or create uncertainty and say, well, check back next week, and we'll see how much the folks from the other project have paid and how much money we have, if we can then put you on, you know, an agenda versus having it appear, you know, like an overly burdensome threshold where it would deter folks from even pursuing. And, you know, I wouldn't venture to know sort of what that experience has been like with petitioners. I just know we generally see people either pay in full for the most part, or people don't pay at all, either because they don't have the ability to pay anything, or more likely that they intend on moving out of the home sometime fairly soon. So they can get to benefit from it, but you'll put it on your taxes, and the next person to buy the home will inherit that special assessment. So we see mostly, like, you pay it all, or you're paying none. There isn't quite as much as, like, paying some upfront, unless everyone was doing the equal one-third, and then sort of apportioning the rest on their taxes. So when it's treated in the aggregate, we see sort of the two extremes, oftentimes. That's it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Jack Hurt, Precinct 2. And as Steve Dicorsi mentioned, I'm the Rhodes Chair for the Colorado Association. So, I've had a number of conversations with a couple of our board members and the town manager. I just want to first thank the town manager for being proactive in working on this, which has created problems over the years with funding and others. But I think, you know, looking at it from a larger project like we have in Kelowna, the two-thirds would be difficult. And just hypothetically, I would say if we did a vote in Kelowna, let's say 80% said they were interested in reconstructing the roads. That means that probably 90% of this rough map would need to put up 100%. And that, to me, would be problematic. And because I think there'll be a number of people, particularly elderly, that are in support of redoing the roads but just can't come up with the, you know, in our case it would be probably $7,000 to $10,000 a home. And they would like to use the five-year plan on their taxes. They're not doing it just because they don't want to participate, but it's just a matter of necessity. So, I think the 50% number may be, certainly it helped the town manager achieve his goal, which I think is a good idea, but perhaps not so difficult for those that may not have the ability to pay. The other suggestion I was going to make is that, and we would understand that in the Kelowna, because we're hoping to do our roads at some point in the near future. I think the understanding that a project that large would likely take more than a year. We would understand that. Maybe it would take three years. And I would suggest that, if possible, the language could require that the, I'm having my camera adjusted here, that the project that large would require planning in the sense of budgeting. So, perhaps if petitioners would be required, for example, at least a year in advance or two years in advance, so that would get you through the budget season so you can appropriate whatever the petitions are for that particular year, you're going to have a rough idea of what you would ask town meeting to appropriate. I mean, it's all funds that would be paid back to the town with interest. And I'm not sure if that's possible, but I think the, I would, again, suggest that a number less than two-thirds may be more advantageous for those that can't afford it.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 380</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. The other Mr. Hurd, would you like to proceed with that information? There's a lot of pressure now. No, I was just going to say, just regarding the numbers that we're looking at where everyone, in the past few projects, more people have come up with the two-thirds. In the past few projects, we've told them that you can't go forward unless you can pay more than the required one-third that's in the bylaw. And I just, I mean, I think there's, I just fear that there's unintended consequences that if we go to two-thirds, there is a group, maybe a smaller association or in a smaller street that wants to do it, but then they see what they have to come up with, and they just don't have, you know, other abutters who are willing to come up with the additional funds, and it prevents the project from happening. And they can always pay more than two-thirds, right? So, if we put it at two-thirds, I mean, more than a half. So, say we set it at a half, someone could pay two-thirds, but if we set it at two-thirds, they can't pay half, right? So, it makes it more restrictive, and so I think from all the discussions that we're having, it makes more sense, you know, where we can, if we go to 50 percent, it doesn't solve the problem, and there's still backlogs of issues and, you know, logistical issues with getting these projects done, we can revisit this into the two-thirds. But I'd rather see the incremental step up to the two-thirds if that's what, and it could be that that's what we need to be, but I think if we step, we do the 50 percent, then we can, you know, like we like to do pilots in this board, we can see how the 50 percent goes, and then we can go from there. This seems like a complicated motion, but. Make it, make it, make it. We'll move positive action of the recommended updates to the language with the one edit whereby the requirement for two-thirds of the upfront cost be paid at the time, before the project starts be amended to 50 percent of the estimated project cost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Stein. I will definitely second that, and I just would say, just in the next anticipated coming years, with the next year fiscal year looking at about a $1 million deficit, I would not be in favor of increasing the $100,000 in the near future. However, I agree with the 50 percent, and I understand the rationale of the two-thirds for better planning to allow more streets, neighbors, associations to come in. I think also if for some reason that does become a detriment, that might be another reason why we do go from the 50 in the following year or years to a two-thirds. But I'm agree, agree with Sally with the 50, but I understand that, you know, the rationale, the way it came to me was, you know, better planning for the future. Otherwise, as we anticipate more streets, areas are going to come in and ask for this. The only other answer to that is putting more than the $100,000 in there, and I don't see how we do that with all the other things that we have in terms of our priorities and our override commitments. So I'm in favor of that, and maybe in year two or three, part of the reason for if we do increase it beyond 50 percent would be because we need to plan better to get more streets done sooner. So I'll second that. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a quick question for the town manager to clarify the question by my colleague, Mrs. Mahan. I mean, $100,000 is significant in terms of the cash flow for the budget in any given year. But just my understanding is that that's not an appropriation by the town, but that would be money the town would eventually get back? It still needs to be appropriated. Oh, so it's technically an appropriation, right, but it's. We appropriate. We appropriate, but would the idea be that that would be paid back with. Gets paid back over the course of five years and essentially gets certified as free cash because it's not otherwise being accounted for.

There's stricken language that say which but all the ways represented by the association. So that's that's the change we want. But the second the sentence that. all of the abutters on all of the ways represented shall be given written notice.

With the final drafts, the votes and comments, I think those issues could be addressed while still respecting the Board's sentiment and not changing the intent, at least as I understand it from the Board, about groups of private ways and certainly moving down to 50 percent allocation. That makes a lot more sense. One final question is something that I've thought about and other people working on this have thought about, is while working on this bylaw and before town meeting, there could be something to be said for the petition being executed electronically.

I spoke to him a couple of times. It probably doesn't, but I think the final answer on that would depend on how that change is implemented. We did try and look at that for this go-around, and it just didn't seem possible. Yeah, I think, you know, to me, I have some interest in that just because I think that the safety valve and all of this is the same one that exists now, and that is that if we're still mailing a notice to all the abutters, they're going to find out. So, you know, if there's anything accidental that happens with an electronic petition that would go wrong, it's not like it's going to go through with people being completely surprised. They're still going to get the notices by the board. I guess I would ask my colleagues if there's any interest or opposition to asking Attorney Cunningham to include that in the final vote. Any objection or anybody excited about it either way? Well, it's hard to get excited about electronic signatures, but I'm happy to include that in the final vote and accept the suggested amendments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Good evening, Julie Wayman, town treasurer. So I believe you all have language from our town council in relation to this article. This is just a small amendment that we are requesting, which is just looking for a little bit of flexibility around the committee makeup. So I'm sure you all already know, but the makeup of the committee is the principal of Arlington High School, the principal of Arlington Catholic High School, and the superintendent of Minuteman High School, excuse me, Regional Vocational School District. So we are just looking to add the language, his or her, or excuse me, their designee to the town bylaw, just to add a little bit of flexibility around the committee makeup, allowing for meeting attendance and participation. So we did have a committee meeting just a couple of months ago and took a vote, a unanimous vote in support of this Warren article. So just looking to see if we have your support tonight. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

I just wanted to note that the section that our town treasurer is speaking about is in section four, to add the designee. That's an option that will be available only to permanent members. And I do note that this proposed amendment is properly forwarded to this board, pursuant to section eight of that bylaw, where it was voted on and approved.</blockquote>

So before the board this evening has actually requested vote of no action, had initially submitted this warrant article on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services when soliciting all department heads for potential warrant articles for consideration, inserted a placeholder into the warrant, but in subsequent meetings, in follow-up after the publish of the warrant to describe potential changes in the potential language, you know, it was not found that there was an actual change that we agreed or wished to pursue further at this session. So with respect to that, I would request the board consider taking no action on this particular warrant article. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Julie Wayman, town treasurer. We are submitting this article in hopes to ask town meeting to support this change to how our trust funds are invested. So this has been something prior to my time that the board of commissioners of trust funds was very much interested in looking to broaden how our trust funds are invested. This is also something that the Mass Collector Treasure Association, the MCTA, was also asking the state to look into for a number of years. And so the state has now adopted this change. And so we are hoping that we'll get your support along with town meetings to look to be able to broaden how we are investing our trust funds. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second one question. Yes, ma'am. It's okay if you don't have an estimate, but do you have, in terms of the trust fund monies, approximately what that number is? Do you mean right now? Or do you mean if we were to change how we're investing? Both. Off the top of my head, no. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Call me tomorrow. On the day after. Sure. So, I'm definitely in favor of this. What is something that you could, what is the vehicle that you could use with this that you can't use now?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Julie Wayman - 238</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, right now, our monies are invested on what's called the legal list. So, it's a much more narrow list of funds. So, it really just doesn't allow for much risk, which is a good thing. But the prudent investor rule still requires you to keep in mind safety, liquidity, and yield. Right. We work with Rockland. They're who actually invests our funds through the trust funds. They, amongst other institutions, support this change as well. But they are still required to keep in mind what we have down in terms of investing policy. So, safety being the number one, safety of our funds. So, you know, it's, they do call it the prudent investor because you are supposed to still, you know, ensure that you are making prudent choices, but allowing for a little bit more flexibility. I mean, even the library commissioners have reached out to me, you know, within the first 30 days of me starting as treasurer to ask about how their funds were being invested and asking about a little bit more, a little more risk, you know, looking to bring in a little bit more, you know, a little bit more in their funds, seeing a little bit more revenue. So, it seems as though certainly I don't think we're going to go, we're not looking to make any crazy investments, but something to bring in potentially a little bit more risk.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins and Julie Wayman - 182</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I wasn't concerned about the safety. I was just wondering what the actual instruments were, are. I mean, I'll maybe have to look at the legislation myself because I know if some people, you say, you say like option already, I mean, they're scared. And if you say sell a short, a shorted option in order to scale into an instrument, they're like, you got to be crazy, but I often think that's the best way to like get into something is like, you know, you sell a short to put option. I'm sorry. I missed that. You sell a short to put option, you wait for it to come down, you know, you snag it at a lower price, but if it doesn't come down, you get to collect that premium, you know. Yes. I don't, I don't, I'm not, I don't think that we're going, we're going to be moving in that direction, but we will work with Rockland when we are, when we are moving. Okay. A little bit more. All right. All right. Yeah. Yes. Attorney Cohen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think that the answer to Mr. Diggins' question lies within section 54 of chapter 54. It talks about securities and other limitations and what it's going to permit trust funds where it can go. So that there are specific, I won't read all of it, but that what, it's in, it's in that particular statute.</blockquote>
