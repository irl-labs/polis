<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Move approval. And then if I could just make a comment. Yes, please. Yeah. Since we're all not rushing out to dinner. But the just relative to the reenactment, a lot of work that's gone into this. There's a lot of planning that's ongoing. We're trying, you know, we've with the 2025 committee, we've been looking towards 2025. But we're really for all the communities that are involved 2024, it's going to be a dry run. And so we are going to have a reenactment that's a lot more in depth than the usual reenactments that we have. So it really should be a sight to see it's going to be the same type of reenactment that we're going to have in 2025. And we're trying to incorporate some sort of a parade in there as well to make it you know, event for people that enjoy the history of the town and for kids that enjoy parades. So it should be a really good event. And I look forward to it and all the planning still in process. But I'm happy to see that on the agenda. And there'll be more information to come relative to that.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 125</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. Do I have? I will second that. And I'll say that I like the logo, you know, especially the little untold untold stories of monotony at the bottom makes me want to hear about them. And also, I can't let this pass without saying, you know, how much I am happy that Melissa, Bobby and Scott Smith are rejoining TACC. They've been there. I know Scott's been there since the beginning, and probably Melissa soon thereafter, if not at the beginning, also, and they are such a valuable resource to the TACC and to the town in general. And so I think between them, I mean, there's probably 100 years of work on TACC. So anyways, I'm, once again, happy to second.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 88</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One comment, Mr. Chair. By all means, Mr. Herd. You wouldn't believe how much time and effort we spent in deciding that logo with a lot of options and a lot of input. And it was a multiple meeting excursion to land on that. But everyone was pretty excited about what we have there to represent the town. I can't believe you, having been through these processes. Yeah, yeah, they're an effort. But no, that's well done. So thank you. Yeah. Well, I heartily second all those sentiments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm glad, Mr. Diggins, that you seconded the motion because I was about to run out of select board members. The logo is fantastic. Actually, I love that I got a magnet, I think, or a sticker with it. And I'm really excited about the work that you've done, you and your colleagues have done on the committee, Mr. Herd, and I really look forward to it. I'm excited about this celebration. So I think all that time you spent on it really is worth it because it's going to be the face of Arlington for an awful lot of people. And yeah, to Mr. Diggins' point about Scott and Melissa, I'm a big fan of the TACC. And I think these individuals in particular have contributed so much. So I'm delighted that they are ready for more. So any further discussion? So on a motion by Mr. Herd to approve the items of the consent agenda and seconded by Mr. Diggins, Mr. Cunningham, Attorney Cunningham, would you please call the roll? Yes, Mr. Chair. Mr. Herd? Yes. Mr. Diggins? Yes. Mr. Helmuth? Yes. 3-0 vote. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving right along to correspondence received, we have the Fox Library Housing Feasibility Study from Claire Ricker, Director of Planning and Community Development. We have a request for speed bumps and stop signs on Appleton Street from Jeff Elias at 384 Appleton Street and a memo from the Town Manager about vacation buyback. Entertain motions and discussion. Mr. Diggins? Mr. Herd can go.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll move to receive and I'll give our new Town Manager the same advice that I think I gave a few Town Managers past and that it's certainly happy to see the hard work that you put in that have created excess vacation days, but we all know how hard this job can be and we certainly encourage you to take your vacation days and I think I've said that to at least one Town Manager before. I don't know if I ever said it to Mr. Pooler, but just food for thought. Thank you. Mr. Diggins?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 211</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to add to that. Vacations stress me out. Sometimes it's like it lessens more, especially when I have to come back to a lot of stuff. Some people say, one person that we met would recently say, when you do what you enjoy, you're not really working. I certainly get the sense that Mr. Feeney is doing what he's doing, but he'll take care of himself. I hear it coming from Mr. Herd. I'm just giving you a hard time. I'd like to see that we'd send that second letter or the second item, number eight, to Mr. Feeney and he can direct it to where he thinks it should go. Also, I just want to say on seven, I'm so happy to see that. The study about the Fox Library, the feasibility of putting more housing on top of it. Every time I walk past Fox Library, I just think we can do more here. I'm happy to see us at least beginning to think about doing more. I'm kind of curious about that technical assistance, that $15k plus meeting on top of the $77k, how that's going to be utilized. I'll just save that for my conversation with Mr. Feeney sometime later. Thank you. Happy to second.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I was wondering if there was going to be a second amendment to that. Mr. Herd, you accept the friendly amendment on the referral of the town manager for the traffic item? Yes. All right. Any further discussion? Okay, so we have a motion to receive with the referral for item eight to the town manager by Mr. Herd and seconded by Mr. Diggins. Attorney Cunningham? Mr. Herd? Yes. Mr. Diggins? Yes. Mr. Helmet? Yes. Three-zero vote. Excellent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. And this brings us to new business. Incepting cases of emergency, the board will neither deliberate nor act upon topics presented in new business. I will go first this evening. I'd like to take the opportunity to thank the voters of Arlington for giving me the privilege of representing you on the select board for the past almost three years. My term is up in April. And I'm very pleased to announce tonight that I intend to ask the voters for another three years by running for reelection in the April town election. So I want to say all to my colleagues that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you, the same to my colleagues and the town staff. I think it is a terrific team. It has been a deeply rewarding experience, at times an exhausting one, but I think that's exactly how it's supposed to be. And I'm certainly, the voters agree with me, I'm certainly willing to go another three years. And I will now move to Mr. Hearn.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 468</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Helmet. First, I am very happy to hear your announcement. You certainly have been a valuable asset to the board in the past three years and done a very good job and continue to do as chair. So that is a very good announcement for the town of Arlington. I want to just mention that we, I think it was last week, we had we had hosted a regional meeting for the four municipalities that are part of the intermunicipal agreement for the 2025 event at the senior center. It was very well attended. We actually had more people than we thought that we had. But there's a lot of work, work was put in by town staff, our economic development coordinator, Katie Lussai and Angela Olszewski on the 2025 committee with me. And it was very well, it was a great representation of the town of Arlington. Um, so that was a great event. Next event is going to be in February. With that, I, in following Mr. Helmet's announcement, you know, I've had a I don't take the, you know, the decision to run for reelection lightly, you know, I had a lot of conversations with family friends, and just kind of looking at my own family situation. And, you know, where I fit in. But I think at the end of the day, what came for me is I still really have a passion for the town. My, we're gonna be here for a long time, my kids are still quite young and going through the school system and using a lot of the town resources. I really enjoy the board that we have right now. I think we have a really good mix of different viewpoints, which really is effective in governing. And, you know, we don't always agree, and that's fine. But we do. So I think I said this about Len one time, we agree that we disagree agreeably. And I, I feel like I have more work to be done. It's been an amazing six years, I think we've accomplished a lot. I even, you know, whether it's a 2025, or just event, you know, issues that are facing the town such that are important to me, such as affordable housing and whatnot. I have the passion to continue on and, you know, based on what discussions I have, you know, I have, I'm going to have the ability to continue to commit to the town and balance my work and my life and my commitment, shouldn't again, the voters determine that they want me for three more years. So I'm happy to announce that I too intend to pull papers once they do and seek reelection for another three year term on the board. So thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I don't think this constitutes deliberation to see how how happy I am, Mr. Heard to hear that news. You served the town well, you do it for the right reasons. And Arlington is lucky that you're willing to keep doing it. I'll now turn to Mr. Diggins.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 339</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you know, I'm happy that we're in zoom, because as you know, we're in the room, I have my mascot. So you can't see me when I'm smiling, but I'm smiling. And I'm so happy that both of you have decided to run again. And yeah, as Mr. Heard said, we're a mix, we're the first mix, but I think we get along, you know, well, and I think particularly so when, when we disagree, and I find it easy to be agreeable, agreeably disagreeable, because I kind of feel that chances are, I'm going to change my mind, you know, if any of you are all disagreeing with me, so it's like, I listened, and it's like, Okay, what am I not getting right here, you know, so that I can learn from that and go on. And that's because I respect you all a lot, you know, and colleagues who, who aren't here. And so it's, it's one thing to look different and come from different backgrounds being that's a diversity in and of itself. But when someone really does think differently and have a different viewpoint, and to be not only tolerant of that, or but accepting of that, you know, it really makes a big difference being and, and, and that's, I feel that we have this in, in this group, you know, and we're also, everyone works on the benefit of the residents so much, you know, and, and so I learned from you all respect that the OML tends to hammer us in a bit, that's the only challenge in this job. And I think I tend to be a little more paranoid about that than than others be. But as I say to folks, it's not so much about thinking outside the box as is maximizing the space inside the box. So, so I'm thrilled, you know, I, I don't have anything to add other than happy holidays to everyone and hope you have a good transition into the new year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Diggins. And I'll turn to the staff for new business. Let's start with Board Administrator Ashley Marr. I think she's probably busy administering the meeting, so I will take that as a no new business. And we'll turn to Attorney Cunningham. Any new business tonight, sir? Just happy holidays to all and remind Mr. Diggins that attention and detail to the OML is a good thing. Never apologize for that, sir. Mr. Feeney, Town Manager. Yeah, no new business. Happy holidays all. Look forward to continuing our good work in 2024. Thank you. I will say, Mr. Feeney, that it remains a delight to all of us that you are serving the town, and I think we all look forward to your first full year of service, even though we've known you for a long time. Thank you again for loving this town and for serving it so, so capably. And with that, that's the end of the agenda. I will entertain a motion to adjourn. Motion to adjourn. Second. All right, a motion to adjourn by Mr. Hurd, a second by Mr. Diggins. Attorney Cunningham. Mr. Hurd. Yes. Mr. Diggins. Yes. Mr. Helmuth. Yes. 3-0 vote. We are adjourned. Good night, everyone. Happy holidays.</blockquote>
