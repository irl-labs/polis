</details><details><summary>Summarize the meeting?</summary>

> The meeting included several agenda items, including approval of Arlington Farmers Market banners and a proposal for a pilot program for overnight parking. There was also an application for a new business, but it was not approved due to missing information. The applicant agreed to come back at a future date to amend the application. The board members asked questions and discussed the various items on the agenda. The meeting ended with a vote on the pilot program for overnight parking, which was approved subject to conditions set forth by the chair and town departments.
</details><details><summary>What is the Senior Parking Permit Program?</summary>

> The Senior Parking Permit Program is a proposed program that would provide parking stickers to interested residents who are age 60 and over. The program would be managed and implemented by the Council on Aging department and would be a two-year pilot. Interested residents would need to visit the Council on Aging either during designated hours or apply by mail or online and provide proof of address, age, and vehicle registration. Vehicles that have the sticker affixed would receive benefits such as not being charged while parked at metered spots or in municipal lots within Arlington and not being ticketed for exceeding time limits along certain streets. The program would not allow for overnight parking in any situation and the stickers would need to be affixed to one vehicle and not shared between family members or people within the same house. The program is intended to be an act of goodwill for seniors and to make it easier for them to participate in community activities without the burden of parking fees or tickets.
</details><details><summary>What conditions did the Select Board require for the Senior Parking Permit Program?</summary>

> The Select Board required a two-year pilot program for the Senior Parking Permit Program, limited to one sticker per address, and interested residents who are age 60 plus would need to visit the Council on Aging either during designated hours or applying by mail or online. They also required proof of address, age, and vehicle registration, and vehicles with the sticker affixed would receive benefits such as not being charged while parked at metered spots or in municipal lots within Arlington and not being ticketed for exceeding time limits along Maple Street and Academy Street. At the end of the pilot period, the Select Board would consider whether to amend the parking rules and regulations on a permanent basis in light of the demand, resident feedback, town department feedback, and other relevant factors. The Select Board also proposed a cost of one dollar a day for the permit and an assigned space in a municipal lot in the event of a weather emergency. Finally, the Select Board required applicants to put the reason for the request on the application, although a reason was not required.
</details><details><summary>What is the Battlefield Memorial Project?</summary>

> The Battlefield Memorial Project is a plan to create a memorial at the Foot of the Rocks Battlefield in Arlington, Massachusetts. The project aims to emphasize the historic importance of the battlefield and tell the story of the Battle of Monotony, which was the bloodiest battle of the Revolutionary War in Arlington. The project also aims to broaden the focus to include the people of Arlington at that time and their way of life. The project includes plaques, panels, and an obelisk, and is expected to cost $900,000. The project is currently seeking funding from local, state, and federal sources and is aiming to be completed by April 19, 2025.
</details><details><summary>What was the discussion about complete streets?</summary>

> The discussion mentioned that the Lowell Street project might be eligible for a complete street project and that it could potentially receive half the funds from the complete streets plan. The speaker suggested talking to the planning department and senior transportation planner about it.
</details><details><summary>What licenses and permits were discussed?</summary>

> The discussion included three discretionary permits for municipal lot parking, on-street permits for people without parking available, and hardship exemption permits. The proposal for consideration was a pilot program that would allow up to 125 permits town-wide for parking in front of or adjacent to the permit holder's residence. The 44 permits issued for municipal lot parking would be included in the 125 permits if the permit holders wanted to park in front of their home. The discussion also included the history of the proposal and the process of approval.
</details><details><summary>What licenses were approved?</summary>

> An all-alcohol package store license for Santa Cruz LLC, a common vitular license for Tate Bakery and Cafe, and a name change for a used car dealership to City Wine and Spirits and Smoke Shop were approved.
</details><details><summary>Detail the discussion about Waste Management and recycling?</summary>

> There is no discussion about Waste Management specifically, but there is a discussion about the town's trash contract and the issues with Republic, the current contractor. The speaker expresses concern about the lack of response from the town regarding the trash situation and suggests exploring other options. There is also mention of complaints about yard waste and a list of streets that have not had their yard waste picked up. The speaker suggests that the town needs to do a better job of responding to these issues and improving the trash and recycling services.
</details><details><summary>What was the discussion about the override vote planned for the fall?</summary>

> The discussion was about finalizing the language for a Proposition 2.5 override question to be placed on the November 7th, 2023 special election ballot. The board voted unanimously to hold the special election and approve the override local ballot question. There were also some updates made to the commitments related to premium pay for workers who worked during COVID, and the board discussed the possibility of making payments to retirees who had worked during that time.
