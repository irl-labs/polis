> 1. Mrs. Mahan: "It's so great after COVID to see under Joe Conley and everyone who works over at the Arlington Recreation Department, how well they're doing, not only in terms of the revenue generated, but if you look behind the revenue generated number at the programs that have come back, as well as are brand new, that really highlight the Arlington Recreation Department and its properties in so many different ways."

2. Mr. Diggins: "I always keep us on our toes. I think it's safe to say that you always keep us on our toes."

3. Mr. DiCorsi: "The quarterly reports are very informative. The year-end report is especially so, because we can see the results of what's happened throughout the year, what's being turned back, where we met expectations."

4. Mr. Hurd: "Just to see the top sheet and to see how well our town is run by the people that are responsible for the finances is really impressive every time we get to see this."

5. Mr. Chapdelaine: "Without getting into specific percentage basis points, I think to answer your question, we are making more in interest than we would be in paying on our borrowings. So we're still getting, we're projecting to receive favorable rates when we go out next for a borrowing as compared to what we're receiving in interest."

6. Ms. Cody: "We had a large amount of cash to build the high school and DPW. We started the year with $100 million, and we ended with like $50 million. This money collect interest in the bank. So that's why. So the interest rates were high. Some of the banks, MMDT, had 5%. So that adds up."

> Christine Bongiorno, the former department head for Health and Human Services, provided an update on the town's efforts to improve its emergency medical response capabilities. The town has been assessing its Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), devices used during medical emergencies, and found that not every town building had one and their locations varied. A plan was developed to install new AEDs in locations that didn't have them and move existing ones to more visible locations. Training will also be provided to building occupants on how to use the AEDs. In addition, boxes containing Narcan, used in the event of an overdose, will be placed in public locations. The plan will be implemented over the next six months.

> The Select Board Report to Town Meeting presented by Attorney Cunningham pertains to a single article for the board's consideration. The article, which was discussed and voted upon by the board in its September 27th meeting, is about the prohibition on new fossil fuel infrastructure in new construction and major renovation. This was set forth by the town's sustainability manager, Talia Fox, and also sponsored by the Clean Energy Futures Committee. The report accurately reflects the changes that the board requested at the hearing. The report also mentions the tie-in with the MBTA Communities Act, stating that a failure to pass an MBTA Communities bylaw by the special town meeting would preclude the town from participating in the state's fossil fuel demonstration project.
</details><details><summary>Provide the benefits and direct long term costs to residential homeowners associated with natural gas for heating and cooking compared to heating using heat pumps and propane delivery for cooking.</summary>

> The benefits and costs of natural gas versus heat pumps and propane for heating and cooking can vary greatly depending on several factors, including the specific energy efficiency of the appliances used, the cost of the fuels in a particular region, and the specific energy needs of the household. 

Natural gas is often praised for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It is a highly efficient fuel source, meaning less energy is wasted in the conversion process from fuel to heat. This can result in lower energy bills for homeowners. Natural gas is also typically less expensive than electricity, and in many areas, it is less expensive than propane. 

Heat pumps, on the other hand, are highly efficient for heating and cooling, and they can be less expensive to operate than natural gas furnaces, especially in milder climates. However, they can be more expensive to install upfront, and their efficiency can decrease in extremely cold climates. 

Propane is a versatile fuel that can be used for heating, cooking, and other applications. It is typically more expensive than natural gas, but it can be a good option in areas where natural gas is not available. 

In terms of environmental impact, natural gas is a fossil fuel and its combustion releases greenhouse gases. Heat pumps, if powered by renewable electricity, can have a much lower carbon footprint. Propane also burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, but still contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

In conclusion, the best option for a homeowner will depend on their specific circumstances, including their budget, their energy needs, the climate in their area, and their environmental priorities. It's recommended to consult with a local energy professional to get the most accurate information for their situation.
</details><details><summary>What does the Transportation Advisory committee recommend for the Downing Square traffic issues?</summary>

> The Transportation Advisory Committee recommends adding advisory plaques to the existing stop signs at the Downing Square intersection. These plaques would provide additional information to motorists at the confusing intersection. The committee's preferred option is to add these plaques to all five approaches that have stop signs. However, there is also an alternative option to add the plaques to only three of the approaches that have the most traffic. The committee believes that these signs would help clarify the unconventional five-way stop sign at the six-way intersection.
