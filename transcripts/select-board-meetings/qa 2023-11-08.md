</details><details><summary>Please, summarize what you know about the Cambridge/Somerville sewer overflow permits into Arlington's Alewife Brook.</summary>

> The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) is seeking to renew a surface water discharge permit, known as the NPDES permit, which was issued 20 years ago. This permit primarily pertains to the Deer Island Treatment Facility, but also specifically pertains to a number of Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs), particularly MWR001, which discharges into the Little River, the head of the Alewife Brook. This is of particular interest to the town of Arlington and its residents. The deadline for any entity to submit comments on the permit is November 28th. The town of Arlington is listed as a co-permittee on the permit, which is a confounding factor that needs further discussion. The town manager and Attorney Cunningham are considering drafting a more robust set of comments for submission. The town has also received feedback from the organization Save the Alewife Brook, which has done extensive research on this issue. The city of Somerville has been cited for violations related to their CSO outfall near Tannery Bay, which may be relevant to the permit renewal process.
