<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. Welcome. I'm calling to order this meeting of the Arlington Select Board on Monday, December 4th. I am Select Board Chair Eric Helmuth. Tonight's meeting is being conducted in a hybrid format, consistent with provisions by the Massachusetts Legislature for remote participation in public meetings. Before we begin, please note the following. First, this meeting is being conducted in the Select Board Chambers and over Zoom. It is being recorded and simultaneously broadcast on ACMI. Second, persons wishing to join the meeting by Zoom may find information on how to do so on the Town's website. People participating either in person or by Zoom are reminded that you may be visible to others and that if you wish to participate, we ask you to provide your full name in the interest of developing a record of the meeting. Third, all participants are advised that people may be listening who do not provide comment. Those persons are not asked to identify themselves.

Tonight's meeting, there will be several opportunities for public comment. If you are participating by Zoom and you want to participate in that public comment period at the time that I announce it, please raise your hand in Zoom when I announce the public comment is open. If you're in the room, obviously raise your hand. In the room, it's even easier. If you do not know how to raise your hand in Zoom, now would be an excellent time to Google for how to do so. Let's see how much of the Town's business we can get done tonight.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 48</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First item on the agenda is to review and approve bond issue and related matters, specifically award the sale of the $18,090,000 in general obligation municipal purpose loan and all related documents required to execute the sale. We have with us Ms. Julie Wayman, our treasurer. Good evening.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Julie Wayman - 220</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. Just last week, we sold $18 million in bonds for a number of capital projects. I'm sure you all know that we work with Hilltop Securities and they work with us on this sale. They let us know that we had an excellent result. We had 11 bids. They were telling us that a number of municipalities have only had between three and five bids, so they were really pleased with our 11. The result was we ended up, Fidelity Capital Markets was the winning bidder. The interest rate is a 3.69% over the life of the bonds. They were really pleased, very happy for us. This borrowing includes $10 million in exempt debt, so that's for the high school project. Then a little over $4.5 million for the DPW, along with a number of smaller capital projects, a couple of trucks. We've got the Bishop School roof replacement. We've got a number of smaller capital projects that are approved annually. As you all know, we've got that annual capital plan, and so we've got a number of smaller projects. For a total of a little over $8 million in non-exempt debt, and then about $10 in exempt debt. We're very, very pleased, happy with the result. We hope that you all will vote favorably for the sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. We do have a proposed vote before us in our agenda materials, and I'll turn to the board for questions, comments, and motions. Mrs. Mahan.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 128</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make a motion. Just a tickle. Just a quick question. Are we voting the bonds of 1890 or the 17290? Let's vote the 1890, and then there's the $900,000 in premiums. Yes, the ultimate cost to us will be $17 million, but we're going to vote the full ... I think the language does suggest that full $18 million in that vote, that motion. Oh, it does, but I saw the $922,000, which brought it down to 17290. It does, yes, but we'd like to vote the full $18 million. Okay. Thank you. I just wanted to check. If I could, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move approval of the sum of $18 million and $90,000 in general obligation municipal purpose loans for our 2023 bonds.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 124</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second. I'll answer the question. Yeah. Mr. Herb, may I have a second? Oh, okay. Yeah, no. Thank you, Ms. Weyman, and congratulations on the AAA bond rating, and it is nice to see 11 bids, because I think last year at this time there was only four bids for the issuance a year ago, and the interest rate effectively is a little bit less than it was a year ago, which is nice, too, so that probably comes out of the bidding process, so 3.7 versus 3.77, but we'll take it. We'll take it. We're very happy with it, and I think we heard really positive feedback from Hilltop, so yeah, I think that was excellent. Good. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Dickens.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 111</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Corsi actually asked my question, because I was wondering about the comparison, and I had heard that munis were becoming, well, being viewed favorably again, so there's kind of evidence of that, and so the overall market is good for them, and I think we're benefiting from just our high bond rating, so thank you very much. I am not going to ask the curiosity question I have. I will call you about it directly, but my favorite part about this is seeing the S&P report, so one of these days I'll throw it into a word cloud and see how they all compare, but great. Thank you. Thank you.</blockquote>

It is unanimous. Thank you for your good work. Thank you for coming tonight. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you, Reese. Yes. Thank you, Reese.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next item is for approval, special event request, menorah lighting at Whittemore Park on December the 12th of this year, and I believe we have a representative here or on Zoom to address. Let's see if Ms. Mark can check Zoom. Nobody in the room? I don't see the applicant's name, but if there's somebody there, that would raise their hand on behalf. Yeah. If you're in Zoom and you are appearing on behalf of this, please raise your hand in Zoom at this time. Seeing no hands raised. Okay.

And then if someone does come later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then they would welcome them to speak about and help promote their event. Sure. Sorry. Yeah. I see them, but they've just logged in. Okay. Sure. Yeah. We'll give them a minute. Oh, yeah. There we go. Promote them? Yes. Yes. Sorry. Great. We moved with uncharacteristic speed in the first part of our meeting. I held back. Let's keep it going. That's right. Keep it going. So, our Board Administrator is... There we go. There we go. Good evening. You can unmute yourself and turn your camera on if you like. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Avi Bukiet - 350</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Am I the first on the docket? You are. Nearly. After we approved the sale of 18 million dollars in bonds, a small matter. Okay. So, yeah, no, you're up. Of course, the community knows and appreciates you and your center's work very much, but if you'd like to briefly describe the event, the board would be happy to consider it. Sure. So, I know this is something new that we haven't approached the town officially yet with, but in light of current events, what's going on across the world, and the impact that it's having on many people in the Jewish community that have been impacted and affected personally, we were wondering, we had the holiday of Hanukkah is coming up in a few days on this upcoming Thursday, and it's an eight-day holiday. And we were wondering if we could ask permission from you, from the town of Arlington, to have a menorah, which is a symbol of light, lightness in darkness, and it's something that we believe is beyond just Jewish tradition, but it's more of a Jewish cultural symbol that is beautiful and warm, that lights up the public on these eight days of Hanukkah. And we were hoping to see if that would be something that you may consider for us to set up a nine-foot menorah, it will automatically, with bulbs, and will automatically, each candle, each bulb would light up every 24 hours until the eighth day of Hanukkah. And we were hoping that that would be something, it could be on any public property. I don't have in front of me, I believe we asked for it to be placed on the green that is in front of the museum there on Mass Ave and Pleasant Street. But it's really, it's just anywhere on Mass Ave in a convenient place. We thought that might be something, a nice symbol of hope and light. And so that's what I'm asking permission for. And we would greatly appreciate if that's something that could happen this year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. And I neglected to ask you to introduce yourself, even though you're well known to us. If you would do that for the public, please, for the record.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Avi Bukiet - 137</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, sure. My name is Avi Bukit. I am the Executive Director and Rabbi at the Center for Jewish Life here in Arlington. We've been serving the Jewish community in Arlington for over 10 years. We have, as many of you know, we have experienced, we've experienced a hate crime multiple times in 2019 from a white supremacist, white supremacist group. And then, of course, what has happened over the past couple of months, many of our Jewish community members have been impacted. Many of our teenagers who are in the community have been at school. And the remarks and the comments, there's been a lot of sentiment, anti-Semitic sentiment, political sentiment. And I just, I felt this was an appropriate time to come to the town and perhaps, you know, bring up this idea, this proposal.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth    - 125</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. So I just, I want to just get some clarity on the application so that the event permit application that we have on our agenda that was published and before us now is just for a one day, a one-time event of three, two or three hours on December the 12th. So I think that the board will have to contemplate, you know, if we would want to make any change to that, to, I think, if I'm interpreting the request, it would be, you know, not an attended event, but would be an unintended display appearing, you know, over a period of time. And that's, you know, probably that's a different kind of request, I think, than we have here.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Avi Bukiet - 153</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay. So I might be confused here. So the executive, the director of programming filled out the application that it could be that that request was for, we have, we've been having an annual menorah lighting at the Arlington Fire Department. We have like a gelt drop and it's attended by hundreds of people in the community, Jewish people and non-Jewish people alike. And it's been a very big hit and the fire department has been amazing. And we typically just, we light the menorah with the firemen, with the chief of the fire chief for an hour or so. We take, we put the menorah together, take it apart and we're done. So perhaps that was the original request. But what I'm asking is obviously for something longer that we could just leave there and it could be shown, it could be on, you know, in public display for eight days.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth    - 109</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you would still, you're still asking for the permit to do the initial event that's near the fire station is now asked for in Whittemore Park, right? Yeah. Okay, good. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for that clarity. I think I'm going to turn to Attorney Cunningham because we did, this was something that we discussed and I think we wanted to be sure to kind of be prepared to help the board think through what the options were. So Attorney Cunningham, if you would like to offer some context and some advice about these different requests, I think the board would appreciate that before we begin deliberating.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 489</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely, Mr. Chair. Michael Cunningham, Town Council. This request, the one we had before the board was part of the materials, was just for the one night for two hours. But to the extent there is a request before the board orally at this stage for something beyond that, I could just go into briefly what that type of request involves. The First Amendment is plainly at issue here. This is an open forum, specifically the property in front of the Cutter House. So the public has some right to meet there, express views, various other activities. But the government can place reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on those activities subject to significant government interest and as long as it's narrowly tailored. The concern that I think that this might raise, to the extent that it was an eight-day period with unattended menorah, is that that may give the impression to a reasonable person that that's some sort of government speech, that the Establishment Clause would be implicated in that case. It's similar to a case that the Town of Lexington Select Board considered in 2001 where they had an application from the Knights of Columbus who wanted to set up a crash for a three-week period. The board, after approving that for many years on the battle green, decided that that was an appropriate amount of time and was going to allow them a one-day permit to construct the crash but not allow it to remain unattended. The Knights of Columbus didn't like that result. They sued. It went to the First Circuit. The Town of Lexington's actions were affirmed by the District Court in Massachusetts. That's still good law today. I think there are some legitimate concerns about any unattended structure for whatever, whether it's religious or secular, because the reason for that is not only a potential violation by the town, the Establishment Clause, but also these types of regulations have to be content neutral. To the extent that this board would consider allowing an eight-day permit for one group, that would have to apply to other groups that would come before this board. You cannot discriminate based on content. In that case, Lexington faced requests from various groups. I think there was a Jewish faith group. I think there was a Christian faith group. There was a group related to the sun god Ra. There would have been a collection of items unattended on that particular area, which affected the aesthetic value of that public property. The court considered that and wanted to determine whether that was a significant government interest. That considered in conjunction with the concerns about the Establishment Clause, the court determined that the select board action in Lexington was appropriate in denying that application. I think those are the issues that the board should consider as it looks at a prolonged period or an unattended item on this public ground.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. I'm going to ask the town manager if he had any further thoughts or comments on this before the board begins the discussion.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 98</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Jim Feeney, town manager. I think the board grappled with a related challenge pertaining to the flying of banners on this very building in the near future. I think that in thinking back, though, I didn't sit in this chair at that time. I understood that the board made a hard decision to discontinue that practice at that time given the concerns that Attorney Cunningham laid out as to locking yourself into future precedent with decisions that may be presented before the board. I just wanted to raise that as a somewhat related matter.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth    - 11</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I appreciate that. Oh, sorry. Ms. Mahan, yes, please.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 157</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to let Rabbi Buket know that right before you zoomed in, I did make a motion to approve the December 12th request. That would remain my motion for the December 12th request. Everyone knows I'm a process person. I'm not going to repeat what town council or town manager said, but I know approximately 15 or so years ago, the board, and this is before the last year policy statement, made a policy that any unattended events, that we would only do events, one-day events. There was quite a bit of concern because for many, many years, we had had a nativity scene at the exact same site. We directed that group to go to an appropriate church that had volunteered, several had, to host that. It's a process question. I'd like to stay with that. I'd just stand by my motion to approve the December 12th, 2023 event request.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 35</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Herder. I have a follow-up question for Attorney Cunningham. Is there any open meeting law considerations? for us even to consider something outside the four corners of the request that's in front of us?</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 121</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But potentially, Mr. Hurd, but I think most likely the board has the discretion to edit its, if they wanted to accept the edited request, it could do so at this time because the issue related to the placement of Menorah at this particular site, although not for this time period, was on the agenda appropriately within 48 hours of the meeting. However, I think it's probably best practice for the board to not engage in that type of process as I think Ms. Mahan is talking about. I think the best practice for the board, and again, it's up to the board, not to me, is to consider the materials it has before it at the time of the meeting.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 206</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, I'll certainly second the motion. I'm happy to support the event. You know, we've been through this with, I feel like, a myriad of issues with the limited public forum in the past couple of years. We have a very proactive citizenship or residents that have a whole host of causes that are really important to people in this town. And I think, while I certainly support the putting up of Menorah, I would love to see it. I think it would be a beautiful sight to see, particularly in these times. I think it's really an important practice for this board to stick to just allowing individual attended events. And I would anticipate that if we approved leaving Menorah up for eight days, in our next meeting we'll have anywhere from 10 to 20 requests to put something else in Woodmore Plaza. And as Attorney Cunningham mentioned, we really have no, once we approve one, we really have no discretion to say no to anything else. So, I think, as a best practice, it just, it's in the interest of the town to stick to our current practice of just approving limited engagements that are attended by individuals, as opposed to permanent structures.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 80</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I will give Mr. Hurd the second. So, and I'll add, you know, I see that no police detail is, that box isn't checked. You know, I would say, I'm sure that we are going to make sure it's a safe event. I mean, whether or not, you know, that box is checked, I mean, but to the extent, I mean, we need to consider that a little more, I mean, then let's do, so that's it. Thank you.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 49</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Feeney. Thank you, Jim Feeney, town manager. Yes, Mr. Diggins, we would ensure that any and all necessary security was provided for the event. And I know that the Arlington Police Department worked closely with the rabbi and his team. Great, thanks. Mr. Gorsuch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth    - 228</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I support Mrs. Mahan's motion. And this was what was before us this evening. And for the best practices that Attorney Cunningham spoke about as well, so I support the vote in the second. Thank you. And, you know, I'll do the same, and I want to be very clear that, you know, this really is the board's responsibility is to think about the big picture, to think about precedent, to think about what could happen next, and not to make these decisions because of any lack of support and empathy for what the rabbi's community is going through right now. That's the furthest thing from our minds. I think that we just, we have the responsibility to really protect the entire community and think ahead about the big context of these decisions. So I am also comfortable with that. And also just out of an abundance of caution, given what we did notice on the agenda for this being a one-time event, I think that's the better practice this year. So any further discussion from the board? Okay, so we have a motion by Mrs. Mahan and an inherited second by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Is unanimous. I look forward to the event. Good luck. Thank you very much. I appreciate your consideration. Thank you very much, sir. Good evening.</blockquote>

And we are here for the annual tax classification hearing, a meeting that I have attended many years before becoming a member of the board. And it's, I think, one of the most important sessions that the boards together hold. Joining me tonight before the board are our talented director of assessments, Dana Mann, and the other two men, also equally talented members of the board, William Sageta, Bill Sageta, and Mary Wynn-Stanley O'Connor, who you've all seen before in previous sessions. This is my time. This is my year to have to do this song and dance. So basically, the end result of tonight's meeting is you'll be voting for a tax rate and for voting for a factor. And we provided a, the director has provided you with a, the annual set of information. And I'll leave it with Mr. Mann to take you through that. And after he's concluded, he and the board will be available for questions. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. Dana Mann, director of assessments. Thank you for your time this evening. Does everyone have a copy of the assessment booklet? Yes, thank you. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to start by recognizing the other three members of the assessing team. Our manager, Mary McMakin, Jennifer O'Rourke, and Mitchell Suarez. I couldn't do this without them. And hello to our town manager, town council, Ashley. We can, we're going to start by discussing what makes up the tax rate. We're going to go through some of the components. We're going to look at what the single tax rate is. We're going to discuss the options behind classification. Classification presents an opportunity to shift parts of the levy, which would create different tax rates for different classes of property. We'll then go to discussing the two other options related to classification, and then we'll look at the actual numbers for this year, the value of the town. And then we will conclude by looking at what changed from last year to this year. And please, if there are any questions, please don't hesitate to interrupt, and I'm happy to address any of your questions. So starting on page 1, and the pages are numbered this year. It just gets better and better, sir. So to calculate the tax rate, we look back to last year, and we take the fiscal year 23 levy limit. We add to that 2.5% for Proposition 2.5. That's the 3,383,913 number. We add to that new growth. This is, growth would be the value of new property to the town that we're taxing for the first time. We would then, this year, we don't have an override thanks to some proper budgeting. We'll push that to next year. And that develops a, the fiscal year 2024 levy limit, 140,020,933. We take that number and add the excluded debt. In this case, it's school debt of 13,830,576 dollars. And that gives us what's called the maximum total to be raised. That's the 153,800, I'm sorry, 153,851,509 number. And at the bottom, we give the actual calculation for the tax rate. We take the amount to be raised. Actually, we take the total taxable assessed value. That's 14,523,850,398. And we divide that by the amount to be raised, the 153,807,575, and divided by 1,000. And that gives us a tax rate, a single tax rate of $10.59. The difference between the maximum total to be raised and the amount to be raised is called the excess levy of $43,934. So moving to page two, we look at the current makeup of the town in terms of class, class of property. And once again, the town is significantly residential. The residential property comes in at 94.6555%. The total, what's called CPI, commercial, industrial, and personal property, comes out to 5.3445%. And you can see the makeup of the individual classes there. Turning to the next page, we are provided with some numbers by the DOR, which gives us the target numbers where we're allowed to shift some of the tax levy either direction. But generally, it's increasing the CIP levy and decreasing the residential levy. But it's an option. So the number that we want to look at there is the minimum residential factor, 97.4766. That lets us calculate the minimum residential share. That's the number below that, 91.98. And from those numbers, we move to page four. And this is what gives us the range within which amounts can be shifted. The, what's called the CIP maximum share is calculated at 8.0168%. The single rate share is 5.3445. So that, those are the two numbers within which we can shift. And on the next page, at the bottom of the page we see the totals. These CIP share of levy, this is the amount of the tax levy that's borne by the CIP. And the maximum CIP is the 12,330,510. So within that levy amount is the shift opportunity. And on page five, we see what that shift would do to taxes and tax rates. So if we follow along at the top, the top line is what a single tax rate would do. And then if we were to move 5%, you can see the effect that that has on the tax rate. The tax rate moves on the residential side by $10.56, down to $10.56. And on the CIP side, $11.12. And that would mean a difference, a reduction in the residential tax amount of $14.95, compared with a increase in the CIP tax. And this is per $500,000 of value. That increase would be $265 on the CIP side. So a significant disproportionality in that amount. And then you can follow down that chart the various other percentages. Any questions on that? OK. Also within this classification options is what's called the residential exemption. This is an option that's used by cities and towns in the Commonwealth that have a large percentage of non-owner-occupied properties, where they would see an advantage compared to owner-occupied properties with higher values. I want to stress that the levy does not change in these circumstances. The difference in the tax rate is to bear the cost of providing the exemption to owner-occupied properties. And it's generally done in communities where there's a large investment pool, where investors are buying property and renting property, or in properties or towns that have a large non-resident or second home property ownership. The DOR has allowed the maximum exemption amount of 35%. Very few communities move up to that level. I've provided some examples of what this exemption would look like at various exemption amounts. And it's in a percentage form here. You can see the 20% amount would create a tax rate for the entire residential class of $12.70. And that would be borne by a fairly small percentage of non-resident properties. We calculate that at about 17%. And we also calculated what's called the break-even point. This is the home value where a qualified resident would see no impact on their tax bill. Values above that amount, even though they're qualified, would see an increase in their taxes. And properties under that would realize some discount. Any questions on the residential exemption? The small business exemption, which is another option under classification, would be very similar. The tax rate would be $10.85. I'm sorry, that's not in your booklet. But we did calculate that. Moving on to page 7, we see a history of the single tax rates for the town. And on page 8, often referred to as the LA-4, which has been submitted to the DOR and awaiting our certification, we see all of the values related to all of the different classes or property types on the left-hand side and their total values moving to the right of the form. And at the very bottom, in the bottom right corner, we see the real and personal property total value. This is the total taxable value of the town, $14,523,850,398. On page 9, we have what's referred to as the LA-13. This describes and indicates the abatement amounts that were allowed by the board in the various property classes. And that would be column B. In column C, what we have is the new growth that was generated in each of those classes. And the totals are listed at the bottom of the page. Column E is the total growth amount for the town. That's that $1,280,500. We saw that on the first page. Okay. This is a little more fun, at least for me. Moving to page 10. We can see what we did in producing values for this year and how it is different from last year. So we start with the single family class code 101. Values in that category increased by 11.26%. And I think we've all seen that in the sales. The assessing department looked at over 730 sales to develop these values within DOR standards. I say that just to indicate the amount of work that goes into producing these value numbers. We don't just look at Caldwell Banker and come up with a number. So I won't go through all of these numbers, but you'll see in total all classes are up 9.1%. And you can see the residential is slightly higher at 9.29%. And then at the bottom of the page, it gives the actual totals for each class.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask a quick question? Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I know all the codes stand for various residential and commercial properties. And I wouldn't expect you to know this off the top of your head, but just all of them seem incrementally similar. I'm just curious, and it's close to 12%, so that's near the 9%. What code 504, 550 to 552 is?</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 29</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. 504 is utilities that are actually valued by the state. So that would be things like NSTAR, electrical utilities, gas utilities. And 504, you said? Yes. Thank you.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 44</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, only because the rest I can see what's commercial space, open space, residential. And that was the one percentage-wise that had sort of the biggest jump. And I was like, well, what the heck is that? Utilities, that's a big jump. Thank you.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 216</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And it's also, we've always assessed the utilities. But recently, the DOR has enacted a different method for calculating value. They're looking at it a little bit differently. And so far, it has produced higher values. So we've seen, for the last three years, significant growth in that area. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Meehan. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. No, no, no. Any other questions on that? Okay. So this page is similar to the first page, but it gives us some good percentages. This is page 11. And we can see, year over year, going back to fiscal year 2020, the various components of the tax rate. What I'd like to point out, you can see that under Proposition 2.5, the amount of that value and its effect on the tax rate has decreased. And that's due to the increase, the overall increase in values. So as values go up, we're spreading that amount over a larger value. The other thing I'd like to point out is the levy increase percentage. That's about in the middle of the page there. 3.33%. That's before taking into account the exempted school debt. This is not in your booklets, but when you consider that increase after the debt exclusion, it's approximately 5.1%.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 10</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that 3.33 would be the 2.5% plus new growth?</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 282</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Okay. Thank you. And finally, I want to point out the average assessed value of the single family homes in Arlington. We've broken the million dollar mark, and the average single family home is now valued at $1,015,162. And you can see how that's grown from 2020, when we were at $825,000. Significant growth in residential properties. Now, how does that affect the average tax rate or tax bill? The average tax bill this year at the single tax rate of $10.59 is $10,751. That's an increase of $523 over the previous year. And just a reminder that all of these numbers are subject to rounding and DOR certification. On the next page, we get to compare that tax bill to what we call our peer community. Unfortunately, I was not able to get the data for these communities as they only recently, Winchester, did have their rate approved on Friday. But I was unable to get that data into the report. But I will, as soon as we get that information, we'll get it into this form. And it's located on the assessor's website. So just pointing out quickly, the new average tax bill for the town is the $10,751. And just a note, that does not include the CPA tax. Significantly lower than our three peer communities, who last year were all over $16,000. For the benefit of people at home and in the room, this material, all this materials are available on the select board's agendas and minutes page. But I'll just name that the three comparable towns here are Belmont, Winchester, and Lexington. And they are all over $6,000 or $7,000 more than we were last year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Mr. Dickens, do you have a sense of how we compare for CIP? In other words, the average tax bill for commercial, industrial? So we can look at that.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann and Len Diggins - 121</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other communities? Yeah. I'm sorry, I don't have that information. Okay. All right. That's what I was going to ask for other communities. Okay. All right. Thank you. I can certainly get that information on the booklet and for future classification hearings. Okay. Great. Great. Because it'd be interesting to have a sense of whether or not we're competitive and what potential effects that have. Because that could also, since the balance can be tipped in either direction, you could imagine that a very small increase in the property for non-CIP could have a really big effect on them. And if it made us more competitive, then that could be an argument. That's why I asked. All right. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the presentation. It's always good to get these numbers once a year and get reminded why we don't have residential exemption, why we don't have a two-tiered tax system. One question that came up early in the presentation, and after six presentations of this, I probably should have asked this five years ago, but what accounts for the excess levy in that I understand we're asking for less than the maximum total that we can raise. Is that just a budgeting issue? No. Where we always talk about the constraints of Proposition 2.5, you would think that you would ask for the dollar figure exactly of what you can ask for.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 66</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. So if we look at page 11, we produce a number called the penny on the tax rate. And you see that amount is $145,235. If we were to increase our levy, we can't have a tax rate with three decimal points. Right. So we're actually levying as much as we can, and that excess means we can't add another penny to the tax rate.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth    - 333</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes sense. Again, thank you for the presentation. I think every year, not only does it remind us why our taxes are what they are, it shows us what we need to do. I know Mr. Diggins likes to talk about new growth, and new growth is really the key to stopping overrides, and these are the figures that show this to us. But it also does show, if you look at the comparable towns, it shows that we've always said we get a lot of bang for our buck there. I think some of these towns have higher property values, but Arlington's certainly getting in the mix when it comes to property value, and they all have similar services. Interestingly, the same four towns that were in the Arlington Winter Classic hockey tournament last year, Winchester won. I was going to say, don't say who won, it was Arlington. But it just jumped off the page when I saw these four towns. But again, we have significantly lower taxes for similar, if not better, services than the cities and towns around us, and that's something to be proud of, and that's good administration, good fiscal management from the top down, and it's always good to look at that, and it makes you feel a little bit better as taxes go up. Thank you for all your work. Thank you to the board for all the work that goes in all year on these valuations, and we like to say we take a lot of heat, but I know the Board of Assessors can take some heat from some residents as well. I mean, no one wants to go out and get taxed higher, but we do thank you for all the work that you do to put this together each year. Absolutely, and I'll remind the board as we continue our discussion at some point, we'll need a motion for setting the tax rate. Mr. Gortz, did you want to go?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Mann, for the presentation, and to the members of the Board of Assessors for being here this evening, and as Mr. Hurd said, it's always very informative, and I'd really love to pour through all this. Just a question, and maybe for an observation, I know your count on condominium units has gone up by about 82 units. The number of two-family units has gone down by about 40. Is that what you're seeing for conversions?</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 27</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. We had just that amount of conversions. I think there was also one three-family that converted to two condominiums, but that's exactly what those numbers show.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 57</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, and then on the 111 to 125, but 112s in particular, which is apartments, eight units or greater, I see that's up by one. Is that the beginning of the MIRAC development, and I don't know. It seems like we'll have some growth this year, but perhaps more in fiscal 25 from that project as well?</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 57</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly, so we're required by the DOR to assess the percentage completion on projects like that as of July 1. I'm sorry, July 31st. We have to have that percentage of completion, and we determine a full market value, and we take that percentage of completion as the assessment amount and the growth amount from that.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth    - 310</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, and again, we don't know what growth is going to be like next year. It seems like you have a few things. I know Mr. Feeney had said building permits are down more recently, and that usually gets reflected a year or two out, but you've actually achieved more than a million dollars in growth the past two years, and I know it's a lot of pressure. Hopefully you can find another similar amount or a little bit growth there, but that's just encouragement, and hopefully there's enough activity. Just two more comments if I could, Mr. Chairman. On the tax rate, and again, this is reflective of values going up in Arlington. By the table you put in here, the $10.59 is the lowest tax rate I think we've ever had since it's been reported, $10.61 back in 2004, so again, that just shows that relationship between value and tax rates because we're going to grow 2.5%, but values are continuing to rise here, and the last thing I would say is on the exempt count, and thank you. It looks like there's been a real large increase in the value of exempt property, which we don't receive any revenue on, but it looks like it's about 7% of the overall, which I think compared to some other communities is probably on the low side, but it's always helpful just to see that relationship, so thank you for the comprehensive presentation and for all the data. You want to make a motion? Yeah, I'd like to make a motion, Mr. Chairman, and I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Mann, but by adopting a single rate, what the motion would be is to adopt a residential factor of one, and we're not going to do anything on the resident, I'm not moving anything on the residential exemption.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 14</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't have a small business exemption, so just that single vote, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 43</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second. All right, Mr. Dickens. Yeah, I had a couple questions. I had my fingers up because I saw Mr. Mann leaving, and I was like, oh yeah, there for him, you know, so quickly, is there a pattern to the new growth?</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann and Len Diggins - 156</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a difficult question. There's several factors. There's the general economy that you would consider. There's zoning issues can have an impact on growth, but yeah, we tend to follow a general pattern of the economy. People are investing in Arlington. They're adding to their homes, they're building new homes, and all of that generates growth. But it's individuals investing, not corporations or anything like that? Well, we do have growth in all of our class, well, not all, but in the commercial end as well as the residential side. Okay, and actually what I was getting at is in terms of the residential investment, that's from individuals opposed to companies. Yeah, what I mean by investment in Arlington is the interest in buying houses in Arlington is generating competition, which raises the value of the homes and interest in the new homes that are being built and increasing those values. which in turn increases growth.</blockquote>
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins and Dana Mann - 192</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got you. I mean, and the reason I was asking about that is that I think MAPC just recently released a study being on speculation, I mean, and for them, I mean, the speculation is, they define that as investing or investors. And so, I was just trying to understand, I mean, if we're talking about the same type of thing. So, I'm just trying, you get what I'm getting? Yeah, I do. Yeah. And I wouldn't classify it as. I think we're using the same term a little bit differently. I know, that was confusing when they did that. It's like, people are like, what do you mean? You know what I mean? So, okay, great. And I would be interested in the data on the small business exemptions. I mean, is that on the website or is that something I have to ask you for? No, I think I can provide you with those figures. Okay, great. And then we'll look at incorporating it in the booklet in the coming years. Not that it would even remotely affect me, my feelings about the motion. All right, thank you very much.</blockquote>

Oh, it is a public hearing. Sorry. All right. Thank you, Mr. Mann. This is a public hearing. So, if anyone would like to, before we vote to set the tax rate, make a public comment. If you're on Zoom, raise your hand on this item or if you're in the room, please raise your hand in the room. Okay, I think we're good.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Sure, and thank you for raising that point. I actually have been in touch with some of the folks from Montague Street about exactly the same thing, but given the large number of betterments that have processed through the board, and as you know, many folks choose to pay up front for that, but there's at least a handful every time around that do not, so we're not collecting those funds until quarterly payments are received over the course of five years. So it takes, we contend to deplete the account faster than it replenishes with collections unless and until the town, through town meeting, takes an action to sort of seed that account with money and with the number of betterments that we processed and the size of some of those betterments this year, we've sort of stretched beyond what we could afford in this fiscal year unless, of course, the residents were able to provide additional funding beyond the one-third required up front and as was done with the last betterment that approved so that it could proceed on a faster timeline. Thank you.</blockquote>

We do have the signatures to start the upper part of Montague, but we're waiting for it from the engineering department to give us the technical details. So we can send it to the paving companies for them to give us a quote. If this only starts in April, maybe by then we can have a full Montague fixed because as my neighbor is there, he will attest there's a huge problem coming from Upper Montague, so to speak. There's a potholder comes from underneath the water and creates like an ice rink in his house. So we would like to have that fixed as soon as possible. If we cannot have the full Montague, at least 50% of Montague fixed.</blockquote>

So I'm in it. Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Mr. Dickens. So I'll notice that the one person that's missing lives at zero Montague. So I think it's the typo. I was thinking I've never seen a zero for an address. You land. It's an empty lot. Okay. All right. Somebody, a trustee or a trust fund tried to reach them with no reply, so. All right. Well, that explains that then. I was wondering that myself. All right. Yeah, I couldn't resist. I said it wasn't, but I couldn't resist that one. Okay, any further discussion?

Previously, Rick Fenton, who was on our committee on the Board, served on that committee. He passed away earlier this summer, and I've been getting to learn a little bit more about some of the processes and things from him for that.

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Andrew Hunter - 950</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, absolutely. I'm Drew Hunter. I serve as the Executive Director for High Rock Church and the Mill Cafe. Your question about what 504 was, and his ability to answer just like, without even looking down at his page, was absolutely amazing. I wish he was here to like, hear that, but that was incredible. I'm meeting with him on reclassification. Okay, well, you let him know, right? That was a jaw-dropping moment. As somebody who's produced a lot of reports, and like, tried to defend them in public, I'm just like, whoa. That was amazing. Anyway, be sure to pass that on. Thank you. Thank you. We'll send in the video clip. Great, great. Attempts to curry favor by flattering the Director of Assessments will be favorably looked upon. Oh, there you go. There you go. It's a sincere moment. So let me talk about the Mill Cafe, and just cast a little vision about it. So, High Rock redeveloped the property at 14 Mill Street from the garage, and the sporting goods store, and the auto body repair on the second floor and the auto parts on the first floor. We're talking about that space that was the auto parts on the first floor, which we've opened up all the windows, as you've probably driven by or walked by, and you can see into this space that is the lobby of the church on Sunday. And what we've been developing over the last few months, since we opened on Mother's Day in that space for our first service, is to have a cafe that's open to the public in that front space that looks out onto Mill Street. So the cafe is going to be open, ideally we're going to open it for five days a week, but we can't staff that yet. So we're opening initially in our soft launch for Thursday, Friday, Saturday. And we'll be open to public in normal business hours. We're trying to make a space for the community, so we have a large space there that's kind of unique in Arlington. And we've bought a chess board with two foot pieces and big connect four, and we've made a corner that has space for kids to play in. But it's not really about that, it's about the fact that parents and caregivers need space to connect to one another. And the high school students seem to have a hard time having a space they can just be after school or do work or hang out with each other. And we have enough space for that to happen. But we want to be hospitable in that, so we need to have great drinks. And so we have partnered with Counter Culture Coffee, and we are offering espresso drinks and some basic baked goods and some pre-made sandwiches, and pretty much a grab-and-go menu for people to come in and to enjoy, to stay, or to go. I think it's a really great space for that. I'm really excited about what that can do for the community. In addition to that, we've been partnering with the high school and talking to them about their disability program, the way that they're serving the students with disabilities. We have several in our community that are part of that program. We want to see what's the need there, and their need has been for job placement. And so we've got two students lined up that we would like to hire in January, and the cafe offers that space that they can get a job outside of the high school and get something on their resume so that they can then get the next job. I don't think they'll work for us forever, but that we could be that interim step. And as we've talked with them, now we've talked with other organizations in the surrounding communities, and this need is huge. And so initially, we're staffing it with our team to learn, because we've never opened a cafe before, but come January, we're going to begin employing people with disabilities and making this a space that creates community for Arlington, but also is community-serving. And we're excited about that. It's a non-profit. We're not looking to make money. All the profits from the cafe will actually go to support other non-profits, including... So the way we're doing that, to help people understand that, is that every time you buy something at the cafe, you get a vote. And we'll have three opportunities for you to vote where our profits go to, should we make profit. I know a lot of cafes don't. But if we do, then what are we going to do with that? I think that's important, because if you're going to come into a church like ours, and you're going to go to a cafe, you might have reservation about, what am I supporting here? So let's be really transparent about it, and let you have a choice in that. So we've had Food Link in our basement for a long time. We've helped support them, and they've been a partner for us for years. So we're going to have that be one of our options. And we have an option that serves families on the border of Mexico and the United States, and an option that's international. And you can choose. Where would you like? And then we'll just divide any profits we get among them. So I've not seen anything like this, which is just fun for me as a dreamer and an entrepreneur in this space, to bring this to you. And so I'm asking for approval. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

And that creative idea about the participatory element of determining where the profits go, that's good. That's really good. I really, really like that. And also, I like that you are trying to help those who are disabled get employment. And so I don't know if that also includes people with Down syndrome, but they tend to be very good workers. My one concern is on the pest management. You indicate that you're using First Strike, which is a S-G-A-R. So those are kind of bad for raptors. So we actually passed a... We had an article in our last warrant that really is trying to discourage the town from using them. And so on the town side, which we can control, we are no longer using them, or at least we're transitioning to not using them. We can't really affect businesses, but we can let you know that it is a big concern in town. But I mean, I really appreciate the transparency, well, not transparency, but that you're letting us know that you do have pest management, but I just wanted to flag that, all right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mahan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I wish I had a PREV-CODE 504 question to ask you. Everything's pretty explanatory here, and I do appreciate, as my colleague Mr. Diggins said about having employees with disabilities, but it not only, as you know, not only helps the individual. It definitely helps the community to, you know, see, you know, everyone says, oh, diversity and transparency, and I'm not saying that in a sarcastic or negative way, but first and foremost are actions. And I think it's, I like it to be able to see it here in our Arlington community versus, you know, a Facebook story out of Norwood or Bend, Oregon. I'm going to get my town wrong or anything like that. But it really is reciprocal, as someone who, you know, deals with that, as we all do to varying degrees in my family life. So I thank you for the opportunity that you're giving to those two individuals and future, but even more so for the Arlington community, high school, all the way up to, if you can make it to 110, 120 years old, God bless you, you've got a place to sit and hope your backpack's not that heavy.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kristen Anderson and David Stauff - 553</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Kristen Anderson, and I live at 12 Upland Road West. My name is David Stauff, and I live at 88 Fairmont Street. All right. And you can proceed with your presentation. Tonight I'm presenting on behalf of Gene Benson and Save the Ill Wife Brook. Gene is unable to be here, and he asked me to speak on his behalf. Gene Benson and David Stauff drafted the language for House Bill 886. The bill was filed by Representative Dave Rogers and Representative Adrienne Madaro and cosponsored by Representative Sean Garbley and seven others. We are extremely appreciative that they filed this legislation. As you know, Dave Rogers represents Arlington and Cambridge residents along Ill Wife Brook. Representative Madaro represents a neighborhood in East Boston, and his family lives very close to a CSO. This legislation addresses the CSO pollution problem head on. If passed, it would require CSO treatment or a higher level of CSO control, what the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority refers to as economically achievable virtual elimination. This would affect not just the Ill Wife CSOs but all CSOs in the MWRA's system. And to be clear, under this legislation, CSOs would either receive disinfection and screening or they would be engineered to discharge only in large 25-year storms. And 10 years is more than enough time to implement either or both of these changes. Next slide, please. So why is this legislation necessary? It is because 38 years after the legislature created the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to end the dumping of sewage and sludge into Boston Harbor, and 25 years after the Deer Island Treatment Plant started treating the region's sewage to end Boston Harbor pollution, dumping of untreated sewage continues. Fifty combined sewer overflows discharge many hundreds of millions of gallons of sewage, which is human and industrial waste, annually into Boston-area rivers, streams, brooks, water channels, and the Boston Harbor. And 40 CSOs dump untreated human and industrial waste into our waterways in larger and smaller storms without any treatment whatsoever. Six of them are in the small, flood-prone Ill Wife Brook. This legislation would affect the 40 CSOs in the MWRA system, which have no treatment. Next slide, please. This slide shows CSOs in the MWRA system and highlights that in 2021, 1 billion gallons of CSO sewage was discharged. Ill Wife Brook is treated very unfairly, but this is a regional problem, and Boston must do better. Next slide, please. So will federal law fix the CSO problem? The answer is no. Federal standards allow CSOs to continue to dump untreated sewage, and MWRA has made it very clear to us that it has no intention of doing anything beyond the bare minimum as required by law. This legislation is necessary and essential to ensure that the CSO entities do more than is minimally required by federal and state requirements for CSO control. Without it, very little is likely to improve with the Ill Wife CSOs, and we will certainly not see a 25-year storm level of CSO control. And last slide, please. So now is the time for the legislature to act, and together we can address the unfinished business of the Boston Harbor cleanup. We ask for your support of H.886 and act relative to combined sewer overflows. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair, Acting Chair, and thank you, Ms. Anderson. Mr. Stoff, who's been at this for decades, I want to thank Save the Ill Wife Brook for this work and other work that you've been working in concert with the town, and whether it's NPD's permit, MWRA, CSO, et cetera, we've gotten invaluable comments and expertise and insight from you individually, Kristen and David, as well as others, and I do appreciate that. I would like to move approval of H.886 in the 23-24 year session, and Kristen already outlined the reasons, you know, why this is important, but basically, as was stated, MWRA is going to do the minimum and nothing more. Yes, there are protections under the Clean Water Act, but the town council can correct me if I'm incorrect on this, but there's nothing forbidding us or preempting us from requiring through the state that its entities, whether it's other cities, towns, or authorities, don't do just the bare minimum. But do more, and especially when we're talking about combined sewer overflows, this is something that I think will go a long way, and where we do have momentum at various agencies and in the statehouse, I think this is worthwhile, and it's not just an exercise, not that anybody has expressed this, of just spinning the wheels and doing something. This is something that will definitely, I think, be looked at very seriously and has a really good chance of success. And I would ask that, along with our support, if we vote that way on the motion, that a letter from this board addressed to the co-chairs of the Joint Committee on Environmental and Natural Resources, copied to the Senate President and House Speaker, our delegation at the statehouse, and as well as Governor Healy, I think would be appropriate. A worthwhile endeavor, because it would also give the people that are continuing to work on this, whether it's our legislative delegation, our citizen activists, our town manager, town council, something when they go seek an audience with those various individuals themselves or collectively, that they'll already have sort of noticed that we're on our way in. So thank you, I apologize for being so wordy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Joukowsky? Thank you, Mr. Hurd. I'll second Mrs. Mahan's motion, and thank you for all the work that you both have been doing all along throughout these years. And certainly, the more we learn about this and the more we hear about it, and we spoke last meeting about just what happened on August 8th, 2023, and in a relatively short rainstorm, the amount of untreated sewage that entered Alewife Brook and into the walkways, I mean, it's just something that's unacceptable in this day and age. And so we're happy to support it, and I would support as well a letter coming from the board, as Mrs. Mahan outlined, and we'll keep talking about this and try to get it done right. So thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I am fine with supporting a letter from the board if it's signed to the board. I support the initiative. I do have a kind of philosophical position about bringing these kinds of issues, not issues, supportive legislation to the board. As you have heard me say several times, I did this, I think, in my second year in supporting the real estate transfer fee bill, and as I said, I regretted doing so. I did so because the group that I was working with, the Real Estate Transfer Fee Coalition, asked me to do so, and we had passed an article in support of that. But in retrospect, I felt that it wasn't the right thing to do. because I didn't have a reason for doing it for the bill I supported versus any other bill like this one. And also, I felt that there were more effective ways to go about getting that support. And I'll give you an example because it's interesting that one of the sponsors or the main proponents of the bill is Senator Maduro, a town meeting member, I'm not pronouncing his name correctly, he brought before us an article where he wanted support for community college, the ability for any high school student, even if they're a migrant, to be able to attend a community college. And the board, we decided to vote no action on that article because we felt it was kind of out of the scope for Arlington's town meeting. And I said that I would, I told him I really supported the idea and I would come back to him and see what I could do to help with that. I got back to him after the special town meeting and asked him how things were going and he said it is part of, it was part of the governor's budget and so now they're getting that support. I was curious as to how that happened and so I went to the legislation and I saw the exact language that was in Maduro's bill in that budget and so I try and backstab him. So what was the mechanism by which that happened? He hasn't gotten back to me but now Maduro, I think, knows. My whole point is that I think there are ways to really get what you want and I'm willing to work to see how we can move this along. And so I'm going to reach out to Representative Rogers and Garber-Lee and also Senator Friedman because I didn't see what her take is on this. I didn't see her sign up for it and so I'm kind of curious, yeah, well, actually it's not for me to direct it to you but we can redirect it. So I really want to work this from some other angles and see what can be done to really help it get passed or at least probably become part of another bill. I think there's going to need to be monies behind this so either that becomes part of another budget or maybe part of a bond bill. I don't know but I'm willing to—my abstaining on this doesn't mean that I'm not supporting it. I'm just explaining my kind of philosophical position. And also I have to add one other element to this is that I know that the new coalition for real estate transfer fee is wanting me to do the same thing again and I've already told them I'm not going to do that. So I just need to be kind of consistent across that. All right, that's it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I'm happy to support this. I think a letter of support can be very persuasive. I think we've done it a number of times with the MBTA assessment and a whole other host of issues and it certainly doesn't preclude all the other avenues that are available to get this legislation passed. So I think it is very worthwhile. I know we'll have some good language to work off of that we can encrypt from our own work of recent letters that we've drafted. So just for clarity from the board, is the intention that I work with town council to just come up with a basic letter, send it, or do we want to come up with a draft, present it at a further meeting to the four members of the board voting in order to approve that letter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm comfortable with you just working with town council and the entities that I outlined and I guess it will be the three members. I'm really saddened that Mr. Diggins is going to abstain on this because the CSO issue is really important and when people ask, you know, what can we do and what are you doing, this isn't just a letter on a piece of paper and I'm not going to comment on when you asked for it, we gave it to you on the real estate issue. But this is one of the main issues in East Arlington and your abstention, meaning not supporting it, you know, will be noted but I know that others of us that are supporting it will make sure we contact not only our legislative delegation but also the other representatives and senators that we have interactions with and I'm really dismayed that we can't speak with a common voice on this. I'm sure MWRA is kicking up their heels as well as, and I understand you're on different boards in the state with MAPC and MBTA and others and it's probably good for you that you abstain on this but I'm really upset that you're doing that and I would say this is something you should be doing as a member of the board and to not do it is my personal experience and we'll be friends when we walk out of here but I think it's negligent of your duties to this very important issue. Thank you.</blockquote>

I think I will be more effective this way because I will come back to probably everyone that you all, the board will contact and to the extent that they notice that I'm not there, when I come back and make communications with them, I think it will make an even greater impact. So there are multiple ways to support things and so I'm making it clear that I do support this effort and I intend to be visible on it but I do have my philosophical position which I'm going to stick with for now. It could change but also I do want to make it clear that even though you all did support that request on the real estate transfer fee, I have said numerous times that I regret asking for it because I felt it was the wrong thing to do and so that was for me on this one but like I said, I have a position and I appreciate you saying that we'll be friends after this and I also appreciate your expression of your disappointment and that means a lot to me and I will take it into account in future.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 William Andrew Breckwoldt and Alana Westwater - 275</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Will Brickwold. Both of us moved into 12 Brooks in August. Ireland to residence for just a few months. Yeah. Alana Westwater, 12 Brooks as resident. And she owns the car. And car owner, I guess. Awesome. And I guess the situation is, we are renters. Our landlord lives above us. We have tandem parking, and we have a two-hour limit, nine to five, Monday through Friday. So essentially, we are kind of constantly shuffling cars so folks can go to work or the gym or wherever. And just to dodge this two-hour window, or else we may get a ticket. And we've gotten a ticket for going five minutes over before, so it's kind of a real threat. And from what we've seen living there a few years, even though there's soccer games and things going on, there's not a lot of cars parked there. It's a pretty quiet end of Brooks Ave. It's not that close to the school. It's the far end from that. So it's not unreasonable to expect that there's going to be a parking spot that would be nice to use it. I think with us working from home, it would be very helpful with, we don't have a place to put the car when we move it out. We don't drive off premises. So the shuffling will happen, and it's a very common place to be in meetings for both of us from probably 8 to 11, oh, 10, and then you get a ticket. So it would be nice to have a little bit of flexibility, and that's really what we're looking for out of this.</blockquote>

Seeing no hands raised at this time. And I will further note in researching this that credit to the applicants for reading our parking policies very carefully, because we're not sure that we've ever considered one of these, and I won't be ashamed to admit that I didn't even know about it. So that's a compliment, and I think now we have to decide what to do. So I will now turn to the board for any questions, comments, motions. Mr. Hurd.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 319</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah, I mean, you know, I think a couple years ago I would have said no to this application just because, but we've been going through this whole, you know, kind of change in, you know, how we had thought of our parking policies, you know, the next item, if you want to stick around, talks about overnight parking. The, you know, the two-hour parking is in place there at the request of many residents because of commuter parking. I don't, it sounds like that's not an issue where you are. I mean, I would be more comfortable, and I don't know if it's within the request or if there's a way to even carve this out in our traffic rules in order to just repeal the two-hour parking in front of the one particular resident, but I don't know if that's the right avenue for this. I think, you know, it's in the rules, so, I mean, if we're allowed to create a parking space for one individual, then great, I think, but there's something about that that gives me a little bit of pause where I think while you were the individuals that found the rule that was already in place, I think when others hear it, they're going to say that they want, well, hey, that's the solution to the commuter parking is to just create a parking space in front of my particular house just for my car. Again, I don't know if town council has any thoughts on whether or not as an alternative we can just repeal two-hour parking in front of this one particular house, or, I mean, that might be a enforcement nightmare for police. It just, I mean, it does give me a little bit of pause to just designate one portion of the public way for one individual. Through the chair. As always, yeah. Mr. Chair. Thank you.</blockquote>

I think this individual application pertains to this individual, not necessarily the street itself. Okay. Mr. DeCorsi.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to congratulate you as well. I noticed that seeing you here tonight, I realized it was the two of you. I almost looked at this not so much as the spot in front of the house, and I realize Attorney Cunningham said that, but it seems to me that anywhere on Brooks, as long as that two-hour, you don't necessarily have to be in front of your house, do you? I mean, so what was the... So in other words, there's a stretch of Brooks Avenue. I'm just concerned at some point people are going to start going back to Alewife to get into town, and that's going to become a problem in terms of parking there. So I would be reluctant to remove that restriction because I see that as an area that people are going to... The red line never becomes more reliable. You're going to see more people, more people going into town. So I see that potentially as a problem. You might find what's going to happen is there's going to be cars in front of your house before you even pull out of the driveway, because that was the experience. That's what led that restriction to go in prior to the pandemic. And so just asking you if you had, ideally you'd like to be in front of your house, but if it was a sticker for daytime use, would you care if it was anywhere on the street? Yeah. I mean, we really weren't thinking of removing the two-hour parking in front of the house. The way it's written, I don't know exactly how to interpret it, but yeah,</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Dickens. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, to be clear, when we evaluated this request, it was... This would be interpreted as what we call a dash pass. So you would be getting an 8.511 piece of paper that lists your license plate and exempts you from two-hour parking on Brooks Ave. So this would not be consideration of a physical parking spot located in a specific space on the street. Hopefully that's helpful. Thank you. Mr. Jernigan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chair, just to back that up, and I think Mr. Hurd alluded to it earlier, I think that to do something otherwise and why my interpretation is what it is, is it really creates an enforcement nightmare. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So I think that that's... That factors into how I interpreted this particular regulation. Mr. Jacobson. I don't want to jump in in front of other people. So I... Given new information, you know, we learn something new every time in these meetings. We try to be prepared, but it's hard with everything that we have on our plates. So as... You know, I guess I had in my mind envisioned this like a reserved handicap space in front of somebody's house. And if that's not the case, then it is, you know... It's definitely more palatable for me because, you know, essentially someone is parked in front of your house. I don't want to knock on the door and say, hey, get out of here, this is my spot. It does create issues of, you know, other neighbors that might say, hey, this car has been parked in front of my house for eight hours, so I would... If we do approve this, I would recommend, you know, kind of spreading out the burden a little bit if he can't be in front of your house. But I mean, I guess my suggestion with the two-hour parking was just relative to an idea that we're putting it specifically in your house and kind of granting you a little piece of town property all to yourselves. So with that, I would withdraw any requests to explore, you know, repealing two-hour parking just in one particular location.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My process and all the P words that I like to talk about, but I definitely stand by it. To me, you'd have to demonstrate a hardship. And when you say your hardship is, you know, having to shuffle in and out of the driveway, to me that's not a hardship, that's an inconvenience. And what you have to understand is your neighbors came before the board and said, because of the commuter parking, please put this two-hour in effect. And we understand the sacrifice of that, including having people come over to visit if it's more than two hours, but because of the... situation there they ask that and I know there are other streets I'm thinking of precedent what would happen here if we approve this which I'm not inclined to do honestly if if the request was you know it's a temporary thing and you know say I had a medical issue and I have a caregiver coming for two weeks two months whatever yes but because of the shuffle and not wanting to do that and being out on the street I know there are other streets and I've spoken to neighbors on Lafayette and Boulevard because I go nuts in the morning go down there by 630 in the morning completely packed with commuter parking and people like I can't even get out of my driveway we've had to have police come down and try to and you can't find the owners because they're on the L wife so but they haven't taken the step to put up the two-hour parking because they don't want to give up the rare opportunity that they can park on their street so I think for this particular request I would not be in favor of it I would not support it because you do have an option you can shuffle your cars around I know it's a pain you can come by my house 23 Howard Street I have two adult disabled people who live there and I do the shuffle and I have a hill like this which really stinks in the wintertime because you got a sand and plot and shovel otherwise you go into the backyard on Higgins Street so I totally get that but we have to be mindful of what we do here I mean maybe if you go out and canvas your neighbors and say will you support us to repeal the request of Brooks Ave Paolo Marinelli and others which I don't think they'll be in favor of to say to get rid of two-hour parking so that we can do that but to have this one individual so that you don't have to do the shuffle out of your driveway I think it I think it's a really it's a precedent that I'm very leery of so I I'll wait to see what the rest of the board does but I wouldn't support it and I can only imagine what it would open mr. be for attorney Cunningham we grant this what's the is it in perpetuity we're granting it forever is it something that has to be renewed is it something that we can take back if we don't want to renewable yearly okay renew Daniel a mr. idea</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay I I mean I hear all that and I think that's a consideration that we've had I think that's a consideration we had with overnight parking and there wasn't a whole lot of I mean we had the pilot and it was I think a lot fewer people that requested overnight parking permits and I think in the past we've not granted or not particularly we talk a lot about what I'm parking clearly this is a new issue that we've dealt with the daytime parking but you know I think we granted it we were hesitant because we thought it would create this influx of people parking overnight and it hasn't so I guess my mentality is kind of getting going towards not saying no to something because of what could you know relative to parking you know to say all you know all these people could come out of the woodwork and ask for the same thing I think I mean would it be within our discretion if all of a sudden you know 400 people in East Arlington said I want to do that get one of these passes to that to start denying passes and then just say you know when they come up for a renewal say you know we kind of open a can't can of worms and we're not gonna renew any of them that we have out there and then we're gonna go to town meeting and ask men dar zoning bylaws to take out this do we have wide discretion I guess in this area or is it something that if we if we approve one we have to approve a similar application I think mr. heard you would have that discretion the board would have that discretion and I think that the applications would be considered a case-by-case basis anyway pursuant to the the hardship evaluation that mrs. Mahan talked about the traditionally that's that's the type of analysis I've seen the board undertake on these types of applications so there could be applications that the board might deem more or less of a hardship than others but to the extent that there was a wave of applications that it created a problem and the board wanted to reconsider its position at that point and begin denying those applications and then not renewing applications as they came up at the end of a year that would be within the board's discretion okay let me ask a couple questions that I'll turn to my my colleagues to the town manager if you are aware can you give us an idea of how many of these to our parking streets there are like I'm thinking about a potential expansion you know I wouldn't say a precedent because this is already in our parking policies but if we had more people aware of this what would what we'd be looking at that</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mr. chairman yeah I I am comfortable with and I'll say why I I view this as a special situation because of where you live being close to ill wife one to both applicants here work at home and that to me is the condition for us granting you the permit so if your job situation changed or something like that that may come up at renewal time but that to me is the precedent the other thing when I look at our parking policies we have hardship in the overnight parking section this section doesn't mention hardship it just mentions that someone can come in so I view that again I didn't create the policy but I follow try to follow the policy that to me gives us discretion in terms of the the special circumstance so I think proximity to ill wife and it is part of a larger problem that we may be looking at in terms of what type of enforcement we have but I think you're in a unique situation and other parts of town you wouldn't have that worry you could just park all day but because of where you are and because of the issues there I think it makes sense that the two-hour but because you find yourself in jobs that are at home I personally am comfortable based on our on the language of our policy and approving this so on that basis I'm going to move approval thank you</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I'll make a few remarks as well I would also I'll also support that motion if nobody else seconds it I'll second it out of you know I think that I also feel that I'm mindful of the newness of this and you know some of the risks that come with with new but I think the policy is there I think mr. Corsi makes a really fair point that you know that it doesn't mention hardship and and I think the the residents did their homework and you know and made a case for why that might be a fair thing to do I'm also mindful that the purpose of the two-hour parking in that location is to prevent commuter parking at a wife and by definition this would you know this is not not a concern that wouldn't that wouldn't dilute or weaken that in any way if we do get other requests I think we would need to subject to the discretion but err on the side of being understanding of those and I think what would happen would be there may or may not be room on the street you know if they were to fill up with other daytime permits and I'm not necessarily encouraging that I think the board should retain some discretion about if we were to vote to do this about about doing that but I'm just kind of pointing out in my in my thinking that I think it's a reasonable you know there's some reasonable parameters that would allow us to do this if we if we have board to do that so I think we do have a motion by mr. Corsi and mr. heard and I'll second the motion it's similar to mr. Corsi and Selma said is I mean the language is pretty clear and you know we've got a lot of experience with overnight parking permits in six years this is the first one of these has come up and I think you you know what if you get the request approved just know that if all of a sudden 2,000 of your friends and neighbors find out about this that they asked for it as well it could next year it might not happen but for now we have relief that's in our traffic policies and I don't see a reason to not grant what's laid out before us any further discussion oh I would just maybe this is out of scope for now be but I would like us to kind of maybe review the policy at some point soon you know and then yeah and maybe keep it mean change it or whatever you know so because because we maybe also look at the other streets mean that have these time limits and see you know if if let's say me folks aren't working me from home me but they're in made a dense building lots of cars mean and they want to avail themselves of this me will we say yes or no me because right now if the threshold is that you're working well let's make maybe the unemployed or whatever you know and now you know they they have two cars and they don't want the hardship of having to shuffle around you know we just I think we need some way that we are applying this consistently so that it's not looking like we are biased in some way that is less palatable you know that's it thanks</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and because the world runs or the universe runs on irony this would come up I'm sure you're gonna know how I'm gonna go on this speed but I hope you have the data in front of you mean and so when the last time I presented this data we had 60 you know people who had availed themselves we you know the trial mean and it went up to 70 he just just a data point that really means nothing other than to say that we have 70 people that have our party trial made of County East Arlington is precincts one through seven he and the rest of our list is 8 to 21 we have 38 in East Arlington and 32 in the rest of Arlington which amounts to 54 percent you know in the east and 46 percent elsewhere you know this is fairly even split you know and so I asked the chief beat up to give me data that she thought would be helpful in helping us assess the impact of this meet up I asked her that or I said tell me what data you have and then I will make the request I was hoping I get the latter you know but but I got the former they don't have it so for so for her that was the the number of tickets that have been issued and the complaint number now these numbers mean or or townwide you know and she says the complaint number you really have to take it with a grain of salt because you know there's they aren't entered consistently you know and and so so um and I think anecdotally mean for us getting emails I got only one mean that was I guess it before well during during the trial and that was really based on me someone who had who lived on Mass Ave and was apparently parking on another street mean I imagine that's because you can't park on Mass Ave, you know, and also, we, I think one of the things that we did, which I think is a source of tension for me is that we told people that they need to park me like in front of their place or as close to their place as possible, which I think creates this sense of me, that space in front of my house is mine, and it's like, well, it's not, you know, and, but nonetheless, I understand why we did that, and I would say if we, well, if we review things, I mean, later in a positive light, we might want to take that into consideration. And so, I have talked with the town manager, I've talked with Mrs. DeCourcy, and I've talked with the chief, I mean, and chief especially has said that she would be fine if we froze the number of participants, you know, and then carry this through the spring as another trial to see how this works, you know, during winter, because we need to see how people behave when we tell them that they need to get off the street, I mean, during a snow emergency, I mean, and that would give us a chance to come up with maybe a secondary warning system, because right now we send town-wide email to folks letting them know they have to get off the street, but the manager said he thinks it would be not burdensome to create another layer of warning to people, I mean, to let them know that they really do need to get their cars off the street and that they have a space, meaning that their sticker that they bought gave them a space, I mean, and a lot, so I feel that freeziness would be in the spirit, I mean, of what we told people regarding the pilot, in that we're not going to continue the trial and allow more people in, we're just going to now take the 70 we have and base another trial off of that to see how the system works in the wintertime, because I think that's what people are most concerned about, and so if we were to do that, I mean, and I'm thankful that you put potential vote on it, because I told you I didn't want people to feel they need to make a decision now about whether we do this additional trial later on, is that we'd have to determine how long it would last, whether it was through March, April, or longer, but what I would like, if we needed to vote on it, is that we would say no more people need in the trial now, because we don't want a rush, you know, into the trial, given that this would be potentially new information that we're going to allow people who have already signed up need to, they'll have to pay, you know, more, but to continue through the winter as another trial. That's it. Thanks.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 13</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good question. No, the number of current permit holders. Gotcha. Yeah. Mr. Hurd?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 489</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I will say, in full disclosure, there's now 71. 72. 72. Oh, wow. As of today, and there's one sole permit holder in Precinct 18. You know, I actually, I think, I'd be supportive of letting it continue, and I'm almost hesitant to cap it, and the reason, when I look at these complaints, these complaints aren't about the 70 cars, because in a given night, if there's 70 people that have permits, there's 500 cars parked throughout Arlington. If you drive around, there's a lot of areas in Arlington that just don't get ticketed, and I, it seems almost inequitable, especially since now I'm in that group of beneficiaries of this, that, I mean, when we put these permits out, we didn't get a rush, and I don't think there's any evidence that if we continue it, that there's going to be a rush for additional applicants. But I think everyone, when it snows, we all know, we get pinged, and we have to get, not just overnight, we have to get a, for a snow emergency, we have to get our cars off during the day, too. You have to get your cars off the street if there's a snow emergency, so I mean, I think just in general, there is sufficient notice. I mean, I don't want to go against the recommendation of the Chief and what the, you know, what the overwhelming, what the board thinks. I just, my inclination was just to kind of let it roll, because I don't anticipate that whether we open up the number of applications or keep, cap it at 71, that there's going to be an influx of requests, but I mean, I think what I've learned from the pilot program is that there's not an overwhelming desire for people to go out and get the permits. And I don't say that as a negative towards the program. I think it shows us that in the past, where people, you know, we've thought that, you know, if we open this up beyond when we used to only grant overnight parking permits in very limited situations, that our streets would be flooded with permitted overnight parking vehicles. I just don't think that that's what we've seen since the inception of this pilot program. And like I said, you know, up in my neighborhood, people park on the street all the time, every street all around, and clearly given that on this list Precinct 18 has zero permits, they're parking without permits, and periodically you'll get ticketed, and then, you know, the cars will come off and they go back out. So I guess, I mean, the sum of what I'm saying is that the people that are participating in the program aren't nearly all the streets, all the cars that are parked overnight on our streets, and certainly don't account for the complaints that we see listed there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. DeGorza. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Diggins had mentioned, he and I had had some discussions about bringing something to the board, extending the program, and I can, I understand what you're saying, Mr. Diggins, in terms of take the number that are in place right now in December, but we did approve 125 permits, so I'm just as comfortable saying up to 125 permits, that gets extended over the next several months, because I don't think we're going to have much more activity. We did set that as an upper limit back in, over the summer. So I could, right now I might even be leaning towards going up to the 125, but I do think it makes sense to continue through the winter. The feedback I've received has been overwhelmingly positive, with one or two exceptions, and I think we did set that number. I know we set it for summer-type, fall-type use overnight, but I think Mr. Hurd makes a good point, and we've had a few people added recently, and as long as that spot is tied to a spot in the municipal lot, which the 125 allows us, I'm comfortable with it. So I don't know if you feel like the difference between 70 and 125 becomes problematic. Yes, I feel that I need to circle back, meaning to the town manager, but especially meaning the chief, meaning to see how she feels about it. I will say, look, I'm happy to lose this argument, but I need to defend it. I don't know to what extent we have a good sense of the demand, because I feel, I have just some anecdotal evidence, meaning that people didn't avail themselves of this because it was limited, and they just didn't want to . . . in one case, I know the person felt that they were paying for someone else, like a neighbor or something for a spot, or something that they would lose it if they took this, and they weren't sure that they'd be able to get it back. I don't know how many people in that case, but it would be an experiment, right, if we said at this meeting that you have until . . . or you can sign up, meaning we have the cap at 125, and that's our experiment, 125, and then we see how this goes, and then it goes well. We can open it up to a higher number, up to the limited people, up to the limited slots that we have in our various slots, so as I said, I'm happy to lose the argument, but I feel that I really do need to check back with the town manager and chief.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 489</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I just would say I almost interpreted your comments in favor of what I . . . and I say that because you mentioned that we don't have a sense of the demand. Well, if we cap it, we're not going to have a sense of the demand either, and we're not getting any additional data. If we leave additional . . . say, I'm comfortable leaving it at the 125, and if all of a sudden we have 50 new applicants, then we'll know that there's more demand, but if we tell people there's no more . . . applicant . . . that there's no more permits available, then we're not going to know whether or not somebody would come out, so I think just from a perspective of knowing what the demand is and trying to see if post-pilot, you know, the word's out and more people are going to go avail themselves of the permits, I think we need to have some . . . I think the 125 is the correct number because now we'll know if more people come out next week and say, you know, we want the overnight parking, and if it's 200 people, it's going to be the first, you know, 50 people to come out to get them, and then we can assess the data in the spring from there if we want to expand it or contract it or get rid of it. Mr. Gorsuch. Yeah, I . . . just, Mr. Diggins, to me, the win is extending the program, that the scope, whether it's 70 or 125, getting it through the winter, that's the win, so . . . and so I . . . I wanted to ask you about, you know, feeling comfortable about 70 or 125, but when we first started talking about this, we talked about we want data, we want to learn more, and I think Mr. Hurd makes a good point that if we do have that additional capacity that we can offer, and it is a number that we selected previously, perhaps that gives us more information, so I still stand where I am, but I . . . when you said lose the argument, you won the argument, I feel like you've done a great job with this in extending the program. That's a win. What I meant is lose this argument. Yeah. On the scope. Yeah, yeah. So . . . but at least I just have to defend it just for the integrity, my sense of integrity. So . . . I . . . since part of the scope suggestion came from my report of the police chief, I wonder if the town manager . . . you don't have any knowledge of that, that's fine, but did you have any thoughts about or advice to us about the scope, if we extend this?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I mean, though I didn't speak with the chief directly about this, given that Mr. Diggins had engaged the chief in a conversation, I do not believe there would be a significantly meaningful difference between 75 and 125, especially given that 125 at this point is sort of a theoretical figure. We don't know what our actual figure would be. My chief concern was just finding a way to make it a requirement that these permit holders enroll in Arlington Alerts so that there could be no such excuse that folks did not know, but it requires folks to opt in with their cell phone numbers so that we could call, text, email, and let folks know that now is the time to get your vehicles off the road in hopes of making it so there were no issues during the winter. And I think if I could ask a question while I have the opportunity of just understanding exactly what date we would be extending . . . we're through December 31st now, but just to know what that date would be. Yeah, that's a note to my colleagues, similar to make a motion, we would need to discuss that and figure that out. So the question of how much further, how much longer, you know, well, I would say a minimum of April 30th just because I was here in 1997, and I remember April 1st, so it would be easy to say like three months, March 31st, but that doesn't get us through April 1st. So that's why I say April 30th, but then we're in the throes of town meeting, you know, man, so then do we go . . . I mean, for me, it's either three, four, or six months, five is just a little odd. I mean, we did five for the pilot trial because it just took us a while to get to yes, you know, but so . . . so either . . . I mean, my thought about this is I'm happy to do this, and speaking of irony, I was one of the, I think, most reluctant to go for this, and I'm glad it's gone well. I would like to make sure that we, I mean, to me, we should extend this long enough to get a good experience, but also to give ourselves some time and space to really evaluate this, and I think for me, that includes soliciting resident feedback, you know, that if we do this for a significant period of time, and then we go back to the neighborhoods and say, how did this go? Because right now, we're relying on anecdotal complaints, and there's value in that, but that may not be the complete story. I would also suggest that that would give us some time to do some more rigorous data analysis that, ideally, some cross-tabbing, cross-tabulations of the complaints with the density and the locations of the permits. I mean, that would be a GIS exercise, but that's certainly, potentially, theoretically possible. More work, you know, we do not have time to do that here, but, you know, if we allow, if we give it enough time, you know, maybe kick this past town meeting where we're going to be too busy to really, you know, really evaluate this, then we could do, ask for resident input. We could do more serious data analysis. We could see what it's like through the entire season, so I'm kind of in for a penny, in for a pound, I guess. And that sets us up for six months, then it gets us locked in with this fiscal year, you know. We get out of town meeting, you know, sometime in May, you know, so. So that would go through June 30th? Yeah. All right. Okay. I think we need a motion. I'll make. Chairman, I see, I don't know if Ms. Maher, or Mr. Peay has a motion. Oh, sorry. We're just looking for clarity. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Of course. Yeah, before we go. So the date is helpful. Would the same fee structure apply? Just so we know. Oh, yeah. Sort of applying this moving forward. Yeah, dollar a day. Okay. The dollar a day approach, yeah. Thank you. Has a nice ring to it, yeah. Dollar a night? A night. Well, you know. Chair. You just gave them that, you can't charge them a dollar a day.</blockquote>

Yeah. Yeah. No, I do too. I can work around it. Yeah. Okay. So we have the 8th. And then how about the 22nd? Yes. That's good. Because we have MLK Day on the 15th. So that works out pretty well. Okay. And then two weeks after that would be February. The fifth. Fifth. And then now two weeks after that is a holiday. That's the President's Day. So we'd have to figure out. How does 21 look? 21 is fine for me. Yeah. I'll be out. All right. So we'll do the 21st then. And that takes us through February. Do you want to do March? Yes, do March. Please. All right. And so then March. Every Monday should be put aside because we might need it. But you'll probably. Oh, because we'll be in more articles. Yeah. You just don't know. I mean, so. Let's start with two. Let's start with two. Regardless of what we choose. I'll just put it aside every Monday. Set it aside and then we fill agendas. Yeah. That's true. I like that. I like Mr. Hertz thinking here. All right. So I'm sorry. The latest one in February was the 21st. All right. All right, so how about March 4th and the 18th? Sounds good. OK. And I'll just be here by myself with other days. That's right. Interesting. Do you also want to just, I mean. We have to do the April 1st, right? Oh, we have to do the April 1st, yeah. I mean, April 8th. We have to, because that's. The 1st. I have it written down as that, so at least the 8th. May as well. But you know, we're going to have to do April the 8th, because that's the right after the town election.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 59</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, new business. Accepting cases of emergency, the board will neither deliberate nor act upon topics presented in new business. Ms. Maher. No new business, thank you. Attorney Cunningham. No new business, thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Feeney. Nothing to report, thank you. Ms. Mahon. I've had my fun. No new business. Mr. Hurd. No new business. Mr. DeClerk.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, I'm breaking the streak. It's very closely, very closely. It's a good thing we're not playing this late. I'm not going to have another opportunity to do this. And I have to do it because of timing. So I have the latest double poll figures. And we had 80 on May 1. We're now down to 58. In November of 2020, there were 149 in town. So we're down to 58. I do still have some questions on the completeness of the list. And I talked to Mr. Feeney several months ago. I'm going to follow up with him again to perhaps schedule a meeting with Verizon. But this certainly is a very positive trend. I will note I did receive word from Mr. Schlickman about a double poll on Chestnut Street that he says is a doozy. So we'll be sure to follow up on that. But down to 58. So that's progress.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good job. I would congratulate you if that did not constitute deliberation. I think it doesn't, in the judgment of the chair. Mr. Dickens. I do not have another business. And I do not have any new business. That concludes our regular business.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 183</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now are going to move to executive session to discuss strategy with respect to litigation against Eltron Incorporated. And I'd solicit a motion and suggest perhaps that that motion include the provision to adjourn this meeting at the end of the executive session. Traditional nominator. I'd like to move that we go into executive session to discuss strategy with respect to litigation. Such a discussion in public would be detrimental to the select board and the town. And that when we adjourn out of executive session, we will come out into public session to also adjourn. I can't talk. Does that work? It does. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. OK, I need a second for that. A second. OK. And it's a roll call vote for this, right? Yes. All right. So on a motion to move to executive session and then to adjourn thereto, by Mrs. Mahan, seconded by Mr. Diggins. Mr. Attorney Cunningham, if you would call the roll. Mr. Hurd? Yes. Mr. DeCorsi? Yes. Mrs. Mahan? Yes. Mr. Diggins? Yes. Ms. Talmoth? Yes. 5-0, unanimous. We are in executive session.</blockquote>
