<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. And if I could, I'd like to invite up Alex McGee, Deputy Town Manager and Finance Director. Excellent. And I was thinking for ease of broadcast, I would probably join him at the table if we're going to be going back and forth. Excellent. We have a presentation come up on the screen. I know you've just missed the hot seat, Mr. Feeney. Do the forehands up the middle here.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening, members of the Board. So, as the Chair mentioned, we have the budget presentation for you tonight for fiscal year 2025. Next slide. So, for an overview, we're going to speak a little bit about the budget process that was followed, the budget overview itself at a high level, some of the highlights of the budget, a discussion of the long-term outlook, and finally, the next steps. I think before delving into the specifics, I would just say it's already been sort of an interesting budget season so far, you know, with we're starting to get different figures in from different entities. You know, health insurance is coming in, in terms of premiums, higher than expected or projected. The GIC is looking at growth anywhere estimated between 8 and 10 percent. As folks know, we often carry a 5 percent growth projection there. So, you know, that will come into further focus come March when the GIC finalizes their numbers. But that, given it's such a large budget amounted to about, you know, a $1 million swing as compared to what was projected. Also, the pension projection, the actuals are coming in a little bit over 6 percent, and we would normally project around 5 and a half percent. So, that certainly was not favorable. And then finally, which we'll allude to later, the biggest change since you received your FY25 budget book was the change in state aid. We had believed to have been conservatively estimating state aid, i.e., Chapter 70 for education to grow at approximately 5 percent. And it, in fact, grew at only 1 percent. So, with respect to the previously approved long-range plan, given that debt, you know, we're now showing a deficit of approximately $1 million in FY26, but we will discuss some options tonight that we're going to look into further as the budget season progresses to address that shortfall. I will say, though, it wasn't necessarily all bad news. We did get good news from the Minuteman School District that for the first time in some time, our community allotment is going to be going down by approximately $350,000 in FY25. And then, in fact, there was a surplus in our FY24 appropriation that all of the member communities earlier this winter voted to use to fund the outstanding debt for the building project that was previously debt excluded here in Arlington. So, that means there was a balance to be financed that was coming due via a ban that will no longer need to be issued as a bond, and Arlington's taxpayers will not see the Minuteman School Building Project show up on their tax bills again. So, without further ado, I'll turn it over to Alex to talk in detail about the process and some of the revenue and expenditure figures.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 981</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Thank you, Mr. Manager. So, you guys are all very aware of our process, but to enlighten some of our viewers at home, we'll talk about sort of this is not just a one or two month process. It takes, you know, many months to get through. We're probably about 65 percent of the way through the budget process at this point, maybe a little more. Really, we start in earnest. As you all know, our fiscal year starts July 1st of every year. In mid-to-late August, we issue our tax return. And that's a little bit more than a year. It's a little bit more than a year. It's a little bit more than a year. It's a little bit more than a year. It's a little bit more than a year. In mid-to-late August, we issue our capital instructions to all of our department heads. Capital requests then come in and are considered on a parallel track starting in November. We do the same thing for our operating budgets. All of our department heads receive instructions and they make operating requests to us. And then, at that point, we sort of have two parallel tracks running, one for capital and one for operating. The months of November and December are spent in a frenzy getting the budget recommendations put together, which is then delivered in January of every year to this board. Starting in January, in earnest, and running through town meeting time is when the Finance Committee is doing their budget review procedures. They're in the middle of that right now. Many of our departments have already had their meetings with their Finance Committee subcommittees. In March, the financial plan will be put together and delivered to the select board and FinCom. April, the Finance Committee's report will be put together and delivered to town meeting. And then, in April, or hopefully May, you know, hopefully not beyond that, town meeting will vote and adopt a capital and operating budget. And then, in June, fiscal year ends and then we start the process all over again. So it really is a long cycle to get through a budget. Next slide, please. So... Thank you very much. I just want to do a quick tech check because my Zoom connection has gone down. Are we still online as far as you know, Ms. Marr? As far as I know, yes. Okay. Great. Thank you. Please continue. Okay. So high-level budget revenue figures coming in. Our property tax is showing high growth. That is due to the override. So that's a 7.6% increase. Normally that would be comprised just of new growth and 2.5%. On top of that, local receipts, sort of our standard 4% growth. That's still a relatively conservative figure there. State aid, we're coming in just at a modest 1.3% growth. Free cash, we're looking at a larger number here. That is due to a likely higher 10-year trailing average compared to our last year. And our other funds, we're going to see a huge drop there. This is because we no longer have the ability to appropriate from ARPA towards revenue replacement. So we'll be seeing a drop of about $5 million there. And then override stabilization fund, we'll see significant growth there to offset and balance our budget at the end of the year. Next slide, please. This just gives you a visual sense of where our revenues are coming from. Big, large, Pac-Man-looking shape is property tax, makes up 75% of our revenues. State aid is the next biggest, the gray slot at 13%. Local receipts at about 5%. And then a smattering makes up the balance of about 6 more percent. Next slide. Expenditures. So after a very thorough process of putting together our budget, our expenditures are showing about a 6% increase next year. Municipal departments, those are showing a 3.4% increase, but that really is lower than ‑‑ it's more like 3.2%, which is in holding with our override commitments. There's an additional $250,000 added to offset some of our solid waste and recycling costs in there. Other significant changes, as Mr. Feeney mentioned earlier, Minuteman, we're seeing a reduction in costs there. The school department, we're going to see an increase, and this is, again, part of our override commitments, so they're rising to the tune of about 8%. Our non‑departmental, so this is health care and pensions, we are taking some big growth there, unfortunately. Capital and debt service, this is growing steadily with our budget. Warrant articles, that number fluctuates annually based on sort of what sort of warrant articles we are anticipating. And then the reserve fund as well, when our budget grows, that accordingly grows with it. Our bottom line expenditure budget is anticipated at $218 million next year. Next slide, please. Again, this is just a graphic representation of what we just looked at. The large orange section is our Arlington public school department. Minuteman is the gray slice just next to it. So put together, our education costs roughly 48% of the town's expenditure budget. Our non‑departmental sort of unclassified costs make up 19% of our total expenditures. Those are the yellow slice over there. Our sort of town hall operating budgets make up around 20% of our total expenditures. Capital makes up about 11%. One thing I'd like to note, that's typically a 5% of our budget as our capital plan, but we have a fair amount of excluded debt that we're paying for the high school project, which brings that number up. And then the balance is paid. We reserve $600,000 in the overlay for abatements and unpaid property taxes. Little over $2 million, which is just 1% of our revenue number for the finance committee's reserve fund. And then again, about 1% for our warrant articles. Next slide, please.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 1914</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to you, Jim. Sure. And one other thing that I would note on the prior slide, though it's not necessarily a big part of the town's budget, if you see the elections line, that is growing significantly in FY25 because it is a presidential election year. And then the following years would not require the same appropriated commitment. With respect to what we'll call the highlights, Alex noted before that there's a hair over 6% of expenditure growth. What we have here for the board's edification is just noting that the override commitments, as you will, that arrive from the long-range planning committee and that are adopted by this board is the town's budget is growing by 3.22%, save for that one-time bump via the override in the solid waste and recycling budget. And then same thing for the school budget is growing by $4,073,000 and change, which is a blended growth rate of 4.56%. But then there will also be the $3,100,000 override commitment being added to the school's budget in addition to the agreed upon growth rates. So what we'll speak to now is sort of the town's operating budget or the municipal departmental budgets. So Alex outlined a pretty extensive process. So what that process brought from department heads was 38 new expense requests totaling $830,000. To date, and what was approved for inclusion in the manager's proposed FY25 budget was 20 new expense requests totaling approximately $270,000 of added expense to the town's budget. So on the next slide, we'll go through some of those line by line, but at the highest level they respect to a pretty big increase in utility costs. The town is now in a new year of our agreement for supply charges, and we are seeing approximately a 40% increase to what we had been paying per kilowatt hour. In this year's Eversource winter rates saw the distribution and transmission side of our bill rise approximately 10%. So electricity costs are hitting us pretty hard. In the facilities department, there are also increases with respect to our ongoing building maintenance contracts. So we typically procure three-year deals, and with each year there are particular escalators for growth within those contracts, whether it be for custodial cleaning, elevator maintenance, roof maintenance, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC services. Those are all scheduled to grow contractually each year. In the Department of Public Works budget, we're infusing some more money for street light repairs and replacements. Believe it or not, our LED street lights are now more than 10 years old and have exited the warranty period. So for the past 10 years, when they burn out, we were able to make a warranty replacement call and get them replaced. However, now the town will be bearing that cost in less than until we're able to do another sort of wholesale replacement and get them back under a warranty period. We will own those costs. Similarly, for field maintenance noted at the bottom, that is another contract that's competitively procured for three years at a time. Between year one, year two, and year three, we see a particular growth pattern, and this line is to fund that growth. What I would say with respect to sort of new services or adding services are the two lines in the middle. So in the IT department, we had to make some investments in a new internet service provider line that would be brought into the police station on Mystic Street to support the future body-worn camera program. That would require a significant amount of data, given the video footage that would need to be uploaded daily and should be on its own trunk line. We would also be proposing to make investments in cybersecurity. I think holistically, we've seen that no longer are public entities, including municipalities, school departments, water utilities, and other public business offerings sort of no longer subject to cybersecurity threats. We are now facing sort of a growing and evolving threat on an almost daily basis. We're seeing new and more sophisticated phishing threats and attempts to implant malware or ransomware. We have seen other communities in Massachusetts fall victim to their networks being compromised. So we're looking at finally making an investment in cybersecurity on the town side, but that, of course, would benefit the organization as a whole, as well as doing some annual penetration testing, a little bit of disaster response and preparedness work, but also looking into an endpoint detection and response platform that would basically live on the entirety of our network and regularly crawl looking for embedded threats and be able to take immediate response to them. So a pretty significant investment in cybersecurity, something that will benefit the entire organization, as well as a proposed GIS or graphic information system platform modernization. We've been on the same platform for a number of years. It is no longer meeting our needs operationally, nor is it fully supportive of the public use of our GIS information. So we'd be looking to move to the industry standard ESRI ArcGIS platform that is better supported, more robust, and has a larger suite of tools that we could avail ourselves to for asset management, work orders, and is, again, something that serves, you know, the school department as it relates to, you know, drawing districts, the town, whether it be. planning and community development, engineering. Any number of departments use that platform, so it's a wise investment because it will impact a number of departments' operations. Mr. Chairman, just while he's on this point, because that was one of my two questions, on the cybersecurity enhancement, I know when I was on long-range planning about two years ago, that was a conversation that came up, and the gentleman from powers and Sullivan and Mr. Foskett, myself and others, definitely highlighted that as a really pressing need. Are you saying that, and I agree, it should be, so when I saw the cybersecurity enhancement only at 5,000, to me that doesn't even scratch at it, but from what, from your remarks, are you saying that to address that particular folder of concern, that also the monies for endpoint detection and response applies to that, or are you saying with the new IT director and the IT staff, we have the 5,000K plus that? Because I think we need a lot more, and I know it was identified two years ago, and I haven't been in the past two years because it's chair and vice chair that goes, so. But I also don't want to be like laying out my whole hand of what our cybersecurity A to Z point plan is. So is there like a short answer to that, or should I call you tomorrow on that? I would say the short answer is yes. Those two lines taken together would outline what is proposed in this fiscal year 25 budget for enhancing cybersecurity. One other thing I will note is that we were just awarded a state grant for fiscal year 24 to enhance cybersecurity awareness and conduct training throughout the organization within the current fiscal year. And frankly, that training element is one of the most important pieces for our staff and to help, you know, protect the organization. It's about, frankly, not clicking the links. So we will undergo training this year, but those investments are the first step that we're making next year. In the enhancements, on the town side, of course, I'm concerned about everything, whether you're paying a bill online, whether it's the actual software of what we need to run a town, whether it's the GIS or the body camera systems, does that also envelop on the school side or do they have a separate software IT department and allocation to address their cybersecurity enhancements that they should be making? So with respect to that question, I think this is one of those elements that when you do make an investment, it has a benefit to the entire organization. So these tools that we would be purchasing or any testing that we undertake would sort of be available on the town's entire network. So it's not just the 5K, it's the 47, it's the grant you spoke about, and anything else in the future. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Sorry to jump. I just didn't want him to have to go back to that. Thank you. So, and just to sort of close out, this side, obviously, you know, the town's budget doesn't just grow, oh, excuse me, I forgot one other item. In terms of personnel, the one proposed addition with respect to personnel on the town side's budget is one that totals approximately $18,000, and that is to introduce one part-time circulation librarian at the Robbins Library with the intention of finally restoring Thursday morning hours at the Robbins Library that were discontinued some, I believe, 20 years ago. So this would provide the necessary staffing to make that change, but also support the fact that we, you know, the Arlington Library System has the fifth highest circulation in the state. It has grown by over 25% since 2019, and our programs are the 10th most well-attended library programs in the entire state. So with that and with the growing and interesting library of things we offer in terms of the complexity of those items and the number of items as those grow, it requires a little bit of circulation support. So the one proposed addition in the general fund budget is for one part-time circulation librarian. And as I started to say, the remaining funds available to the town via its budget growth would be put into the salary reserve for future collective bargaining agreements. So each and every one of our collective bargaining units is up for bargaining. So, you know, our last contract cycle ran from fiscal year 22 to fiscal year 24, so we will now be entering bargaining for a prospective three-year contract running for fiscal years 25, 26, and 27. You know, a couple things that I will call out in terms of budget reductions that were made, we did cut $20,000 from the town's postage budget, and that was via agreement with the school department in terms of right-sizing who was paying for different postage and mailing services. We eliminated $7,000 from the IT budget for some phone lines that were no longer necessary, some related to cell phones, but some also related to hard lines for, you know, that aren't necessarily any longer at certain school buildings. So we right-sized that. And then not shown yet is a nearly $3,000 reduction on a software platform that we are continuing to phase out with respect to our water meter system. So we still have old software for the time being that allows us to access old data from an old metering system, but that we're hoping over the next few years to fully phase out. So the next slide is just a rundown of sort of all of the expense requests that, as I said, total $270,000. We talked about most of the substantive ones, of course. There are occasional lines for, you know, software subscription increases for $3,000 or advertising and printing lines going up by $1,000. But I think we spoke to the largest increases. And then with that, I would turn it back over to Alex.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 442</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, Jim. So very important to our budget is maintaining the override commitments that are made to, you know, by this board to the public when considering an override. And so this budget achieves that. And we'll just run through these points briefly. Maintaining the commitment in regards to fiscal discipline, this maintains sort of the growth caps within the sort of areas that were stated. So 3.25% increases on the town side, 3.5% on the general education budget, and 6.5% on the special education budget. Maintains the board's commitment to responding to ongoing school enrollment pressures. This includes a 50% per student increase on the Department of DESE's annual per student funding level. Maintains the commitment to building an Arlington future. So this maintains certain commitments annually during the years of the override to make targeted investments. Separate from this budget, but already planned and have already undertaken an example of this, you know, looking out for our seniors is the senior circuit tax breaker legislation that the town supported. And it maintains, and this is very important to me, to keeping a 5% financial reserve for the duration of this plan, maintaining our AAA bond rating is of paramount importance. Next slide, please. So Jim mentioned our long-range plan revenue shortfall. And we'll look at this in a little more detail now. This is basically tied to a, our Chapter 70 aid coming in at a lower level than we had anticipated. We anticipated based on our, the continuation of the student opportunity act that we were going to be growing our Chapter 70 aid at a slightly higher level than we have in the past. That was not the case under the governor's budget this year. We came in at just under 1% in growth. And so this created a little bit of a ripple into our out years of our long-range plan. And so when this ripple is compounded over two years, FY25 and 26, it creates a roughly $1 million deficit in FY26. And so, next slide, please. This is likely too small for you to see up there, but this gives a snapshot of the long-range plan as the governor's budget came out. So this is after the town manager's budget book came out. You'll see that really what's important is that the bottom of our FY26, you'll see a red number down there. And that just shows an imbalance. We're heavy on the expenditure side in FY26 to the tune of about $1 million. And so we're going to look now at some potential budget adjustments that we can use to help fill that gap.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney and Alex Magee - 914</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Jim and I will probably tag team this a little bit. Should I take revenues? Yeah. So, you know, first we should look at the revenue side of the ledger. One thing that we are comfortable in recommending to grow in terms of our projected revenue is our ambulance receipts. As this board knows, we collect our ambulance revenue differently than we had in the past with less money going into our ambulance revolving fund and more money going into the general fund, which is a local receipt. And so because of that, we are, we're currently budgeted at about $500,000 for FY25. And we're confident that we could increase that number by some. To give a sense of the last two years, last year we came in at a million dollars, just under a million dollars in total revenue in FY24. And this is through November, actually, we're at $522,000. So we anticipate landing probably just over $1.1 million, somewhere in that range for FY24. So there's a little bit of room there. Annually, we request surplus appropriations from the overlay reserve surplus account. Currently, that account is at about $3.1 million. As you all know, we're still in the middle of a fiscal year. And so the board of assessors has other items that they are considering, other abatements to grant, et cetera. So, but the town manager, the director of assessing Dana and myself have met and discussed this concept. And there is likely a little bit of capacity to go after there as well. And then new growth. We're budgeted at $700,000 right now. The last two years have come in just over $1.2 and almost $1.3 million. And with what we know is currently in the pipeline in FY25, there is likely some room in there as well. So we're looking at these and other areas to potentially bolster our revenue figures. And what I would say with respect to the last two, given that they are within the realm of both the assessor and the board of assessors is just a reminder that, you know, that's sort of an annual process where, you know, these figures get reviewed with not only the director of assessors, but the board. And it's obviously up to the board of assessors to determine how much, if any, of the overlay reserve surplus they're willing to dedicate to sort of the revenue side of the ledger. But it is the case customarily in Arlington that every few years there is, you know, some more significant drawdown of that account to ensure that it is right sized. You know, one other thing that I would mention with respect to the revenue side of things is, you know, part of obviously Arlington's long range plan relies on the use of override stabilization funds. That fund has a significant balance in it currently. And interest rates were, you know, held steady by the Fed last week. So rates remain high. And one thing that we're monitoring almost monthly is the actual balance in that account, given that it's generating over $100,000 a month in interest. So as the months pass and we're not yet to draw down, due to draw down from it, it does create a more favorable outlook in terms of the long range plan. Great. Expenditures. So expenditures. There is potentially some capacity to use some ARPA funding with respect to some of our warrant articles. There are very rigid rules of how you can and cannot use your ARPA funding. And so we are looking into exactly what may or may not qualify. We're confident that there are a couple that we can fund with ARPA and we're still kind of dotting our I's and crossing our T's with respect to that. So specifically the master plan is something that we're looking at. There's a warrant article beginning sort of the sort of revisions of the master plan. On the 250th celebration, there are questions whether we can fund that with ARPA as well. And then there are also a couple of targeted capital projects that we had slated with paying cash that we could consider funding with ARPA. So we're looking at how to supplement our funding with sort of our grants that we have available as well. So the underlying logic or premise there being, you know, you have these one-time funds, you really only want to use them to offset what would be one-time expenditures. And there are some new expenditures, especially via warrant articles, that aren't there year after year that may be ripe for potentially offsetting with ARPA funding and helping the town's general fund sort of cash position. So I think, you know, those are just some things that we're already talking about internally and evaluating so that we can begin modeling. But of course we're expecting, you know, much more discourse with the Board of Assessors as well as the Finance Committee, as well as, you know, in the coming weeks, you know, bringing the, what I understand to be called like the Revenue Working Group or Revenue Task Group together and then seeing where we land with that and then reconvening the Long-Range Planning Committee to ensure that we have a plan for presenting a balanced budget, not only for fiscal year 25, but not showing any deficit through fiscal year 26 either, as was committed to Arlington's voters during the November override.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So thank you. Very much. I'll lead off with a couple of questions and then turn to my colleagues for questions and discussion. Just on that last point, do you know approximately how much ARPA funds, how many, how much ARPA funds we have that are not committed or otherwise obligated?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 36</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's around $9 million right now. All of that funding must be what's termed committed by the end of calendar year 2024. And what committed means is we need to have contracts in place.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 175</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So we can't just say we're going to spend it and have it in a document. It needs to be, we need to have it contracted by that date. And the second one is a question of the timing of the process. So, you know, the Governor's budget is out and, you know, we all know that the state budget cycle that, you know, the next thing we're going to hear will be the House's budget in April, the Senate in May, and then we'll see when it gets enacted. Obviously, you have to go to town meeting with the budget, you know, much sooner than that. So am I correct that for better or for worse, even if the Chapter 78 were to increase, which my recollection is that usually is what happens to some degree in the final budget, even if that were to happen, we need to start with this lower than expected number that we've got now with respect to that and maybe the higher than expected number with UGA.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 161</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Agreed. And I would just point out for the Board's benefit, for also those watching, we are presenting a balanced budget for fiscal year 25, which is the one that would be, you know, voted upon by the Finance Committee and ultimately town meeting. You're right. We're going to have to watch that closely, but we need to be taking steps now to evaluate all the things that are well within our purview currently. Right. We'll just, you know, continue to monitor. Yeah, that is important. I mean, obviously things are tighter in FY25. It may queue things up to be difficult in FY26 with respect to less left over, but I mean, the takeaway I've got is that you've identified some areas that we need to pay very close attention, but also some areas where some good news may well come in and some of it's likely to, you know, based on past experience and some opportunities to look.</blockquote>

And I want to also, you mentioned the Board of Assessors, I want to acknowledge the Chair of the Assessors is here tonight in the room and I appreciate Mr. Jamieson being here because they certainly are a critical partner at all times, but I think now especially when we need to really count all our chickens, it's good to have their active involvement for sure. That's all for me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hurd. Thank you for the presentation. I had a couple of questions, but now I have a comment that just arose, can we add an expenditure in here to flush out the steam pipes in town hall? So we can have a meeting un-interrupted. We need to electrify town hall. That's right. All right. Relative to ARPA, being that you mentioned the ARPA revenue loss and it's not carrying over to the next fiscal year, is there a reason why we can't recover for our revenue loss? Was that phased out, our ability to do so?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reached the maximum extent allowable by treasury, which in our case was $10 million and that was done $5 million each over the current fiscal year and the past fiscal year.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 59</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So now we'd have to look at sort of one-time expenditures. Okay. And the increase in expenditures at 6%, where did, I know with inflation everything is going up, where does that number lie within increases over the past, let's say the past couple of years? Is that on the high end or is that what's expected normally?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 74</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's higher than normal, but it's worth mentioning that in FY25, there are two sort of additional expense increases, $3.1 million for the schools and $600,000 for the town that are tied to the override. And so, those are embedded in that 6% number, they're sort of part of it. And so, that drives that percentage way up. And on school enrollment, I know during COVID, the increase had leveled off a little bit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you know, this year, the school department, again, added students. It was in the single digits. Okay. So, compared to before COVID when it was much, much higher. There was a period during COVID where enrollment actually declined, but it is, you know, back rising. But, you know, this year, you know, the data that we have indicates it was, you know, in the single digits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then, my last question, since Mr. Diggins isn't in the chamber with us, I'm going to embody him and ask a curiosity question that just jumped out at me. What is the expenditure for mosquito control? So that... There's awful specific numbers. So the town, because it's via assessment, right?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 110</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a number that's given to us. So we belong to the Eastern Middlesex Mosquito Control Project, which is a grouping of communities in Eastern Middlesex County that all have sort of a joint agreement to perform mosquito control activities en masse. So that is the treatment of our catch basins in some other areas in town. It's to undergo all the surveillance testing sites we have. So that is a very specific figure because it's prescribed to us via the state and said, you know, here's based on what the cost of those services is going to be in the following year. You need to program in your budget.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 107</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. We've been a part of this program since, frankly, I worked in the Board of Health. If I could just add to that, every year, the way that we determine exactly what our state aid is going to be is something called the Cherry Sheets. And we receive our Cherry Sheet estimates over the fall and winter. And that is... That shows all of the revenues that we can expect. On the flip side of that, there are also Cherry Sheet assessments. And so the mosquitoes is one of those assessments. And those bundle, they total around $4 million this year. All right. That's it.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 187</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. DeCorsi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, Mr. Feeney and Mr. McGee, congratulations on your first budget submission. This is... I believe you started last March, Mr. McGee, so the budget had already been submitted. Of course, this is your first budget, Mr. Feeney, so congratulations on getting through that now. Some comments. So we had talked about in your original budget submission, I think there's been a lot in the news about what at least is in the governor's proposal on Chapter 70 and the so-called UGA, unrestricted. And there was some statements the governor made in the news that UGA was going up 3% this year. And for us, it's, as Mr. McGee said, it's just below 1%. I wonder if you could just comment just a little for the public's benefit. Those are the two main sources of local aid, but just the magnitude of each, because if you were to have a greater increase, you'd much rather have it on the Chapter 70 side than the UGA side. But if you can just maybe elaborate a little bit on those amounts.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 222</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Yeah. I will note, while Alex pulls those exact figures, the UGA stands for Unrestricted General Government Aid, and that did in fact go up 3% this year for Arlington. And we had only projected 1% growth, as we're usually fairly conservative in that estimate. So that actually resulted in a, obviously a, you know, some excess in terms of state aid for the town, but with respect to its size and magnitude with the other makeup of state aid being Chapter 70 education aid only growing at 1%, it actually results in that $650,000 revenue shortfall. But if you want to speak to the percentages. Yeah. So Chapter 70 is, I don't have the exact number, but it's somewhere, I think around $17 million is sort of our, think of it as like our principal. And if we had anticipated that growing at 5%, it's one number. When it comes in at 1%, it's a lower number to the tune of about $650,000. For UGA, it's in the neighborhood of, I think, $9 million, $10 million. So that's what our general, unrestricted general aid is. And so when that comes in at a higher percent, it's a lower dollar amount threshold, right? And so that's the sort of, those are the, those would determine the numbers that we're looking at.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 121</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And sorry, I wasn't looking for the exact numbers, but just on the order of magnitude, the Chapter 70 is twice as UGA. So a lower percentage really hurts in that ripple effect, as you mentioned, we feel in the next couple of years. Just to comment on Minuteman, because this is something that we had talked about last year when we were deciding on the override amount, and Mr. Feeney, you mentioned that that assessment has gone down, and it was a big concern over the past several years. By my spreadsheet that I have here, we had seen double-digit increases from fiscal 21 through 24. Now we're down about 4%. So it's good news in the short term.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey and Jim Feeney - 476</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't completely offset everything. I still think it's something that we need to probably have the Minuteman representative in it, just to see what's going on, because I know there were some changes on foundation budget amounts for other members in the district that actually helped Arlington this year in terms of what its net assessment was. And then just on the, and more comments than questions tonight, but we had mentioned the increases for the town and school budgets as a result of the override, and the school increase this year is to help them fund their strategic plan, but after fiscal 25, I believe more than 50% of that five-year plan will be funded through a million-dollar increase in 24, $3.1 million in 25, and then lower amounts after that. So let's hope the House and Senate increase the Chapter 78, and thank you for the comprehensive presentation. This is not additional comments. Would I not have some? No. I guess, starting with Minuteman, I agree, I'd love to, I shouldn't say I'd love to, leave it to the Chair to schedule our Minuteman rep, as well as if we could get an update on the superintendent search, my understanding is they're nearing the finalists, they're doing the background checks, which was a very important issue raised by many parents who came before us last year, so maybe sort of a dual Minuteman budget and Minuteman superintendent update, when the Chairman and the Representative says that's a good thing to go to. And that is great news on Minuteman. I know last year we were asked for a one-time six-figure fee for, I think, Minuteman field maintenance or something to do with fields, and they said they may be back, and the Board said that it was just a one-year approval, if it happens again, we'd like to see them come back, but it seems as though everything on that vein has really been taken care of, which is really, really good news, especially since, like our Arlington Public Schools, our Minuteman schools, first and foremost, is education of our students that go there, and so that's good news all around. Staying with my school comments, I don't expect answers on this, because this is the school side, but I anticipate by the final budget, which I think you said was March, to the Select Board and Finance Committee, that one of my questions is, are they still using, on the school side, if you could let me know when I talk to you during the week, are they still using their projections according to the McKinnon report, which, just speaking for myself solely, has been a total waste of money for that. My other question on the school side would be, when will we get the actual numbers of actual student growth?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 23</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know for 24, they have it at 108, and then for 25, 26, they have it at like three, four, and five.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon and Others - 1497</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason I raise these points, also, not saying my colleagues agree with me 100 percent, but with the budget's projected shortfall, with the special projects that the board and the manager has outlined, whether it's PACAV corridor, Broadway, Chartil, you do have union negotiations coming up, and DPW, police fire, DPW is so below and low, it's a joke. It has nothing to do with anything except that that's what it is. I know going forward, you'll be looking for that. When we can get actual numbers, because that 108's not an actual, we're looking for a person who grew up looking for penny, nickels, and dimes to add up to a dollar, because that's sort of what we're doing. As the manager said, I think at our last meeting, the last time I got a report from the previous town manager, Mr. Pooler, you can take it for what it's worth, the number he presented to the board. Again, you can take it for what it's worth, it was 9.9 million of OPERA funding that wasn't committed that needs to be. If it's not that number, if you could just give a brief explanation why it's only nine versus 9.9, and if it's not that number, I can kind of figure out maybe why it's not, which has nothing to do with Mr. McGee or Mr. Feeney. I want to thank you, Alex, Mr. McGee, for saying special education. That's something that was a tickler with Mr. Pooler and some previous people. SPED, really, is, you know, it's not as bad as the R word, but it's, you know, and I mentioned that many times, it never seemed to stick, so it's a little thing, but it means a lot to a lot of little people. Am I correct that right now, or am I incorrect that we don't actually know our free cash has not been certified yet? Our free cash has not been certified this year. It will be at some point in the spring-summer time frame. Our last certification was done over the summer, and it was at 17.88 million, I think. And then, so as everyone, as you all know, and everyone at home, we have a policy where we use 50 percent of our last certification in our next fiscal year as a revenue source. And then, I know we always look to every year certification by DOR, and a large part and parcel of that has to do with the Assessor's Office and Board of Assessors, and a couple of years, two, three years ago, there was a delay in that because of something that didn't follow a timeline. Has that all been, everything that needs to be submitted to the Department of Revenue, been submitted, and have their numbers come back certified yet, or is that just not in the natural course of time it's coming out? We have submitted our new growth figures for FY24. I'm not certain if they've been certified. They will certainly have been by the time we're doing our free cash numbers. We won't have our final free cash until we have our, the close of FY24 done, and we look at what sort of money was unspent by departments, what money can be turned back, what money needs to be encumbered for, that has been promised in 24 for an ongoing sort of expenditure that will trail into 25. And so, sometime, like, probably early July, we should have a real good handle of what our free cash will be, and then it will be certified sometime thereafter. We should have a pretty strong estimate at that point. Okay. And then, I know it's not a big number, but it's six figures. The previous town manager, Mr. Chaptoling, sort of had a policy or protocol regarding the Municipal Building Trust Fund, and how that would be applied. I'd be interested if you could let us know by, like, March, if the formula that Mr. Chaptoling had been using for the Municipal Building Trust Fund, if you're going to continue with that practice, or if it's something that... I would ask you to re-look at it. I'm not saying how Mr. Chaptoling applied it as a practice or a policy. It usually runs anywhere from $600,000 to $700,000, and I don't know what the interest, if any, does on it. But if you could just review what his policy was and say if you just want to continue with what he had done with that, or if there's something else, especially, again, where you're going to be looking to close that $1 million capital improvements in budget negotiations. Did you want to... I would just say, as of right now, we are projecting to hold what had been the underlying commitment to the Municipal Building Insurance Trust Fund of growing it at around 2% annually. And then, I know what's embedded in here, and we won't know until we get further in the fiscal year, but I, myself, believe, under inspectional service building fees, that that will continue to over-project. I think the town... I call it a three-down conservative financial plan, and I've said this before, that if you see something that comes in at 150, 200, 300, 400%, and continues as a trend, that that's not necessarily a good thing. But I do think, and we can't know it until we get further into the fiscal year, but I think under building fees, inspectional services, similar to the Fire Department Ambulance Program, and I know there's been some talk about the marijuana cannabis calculations, and those seem to be sort of spiking a little bit further down, so that's another thing we have to take into account. And I'm assuming that... Or can I ask the question, just because it's in here somewhere, and I just don't have the expertise to find it, but regarding the Ellington Recreation, what I call Capital Improvement Plan relocating to the Parmenter School, the cost for that, is that already embedded somewhere in the budget under capital planning? Is it already embedded and or out of Ellington Recreation Department budget, or is that another number along with the million dollar shortfall, townside negotiations for contracts, capital improvements that this board has discussed, that that's another thing you are going to have to balance? No, that is already accounted for in the Recreation Department's enterprise budget. Okay. So, if you could, maybe by March, find out on the school side, which I don't expect you all to know, if they're using the McKinnon report numbers, I'd rather have Ellington Public School report numbers, and what that actual... It's not 108, what that actual number is, because, again, that'll give us some funding there. And as my other colleagues have said, congratulations on your first budget presentation. One of the things I always say, it can never be too long, because it's a really important item, and sometimes a town meeting, when we kind of get bogged down in four or five different cogs on something else, and the budget comes up, and it's done, sometimes, in under 20 minutes, I'm like, ah, because to me, that's something that warrants the time and attention, and for anyone watching at home, it may seem like we're really dragging this out, but this is something, in terms of, especially for the town hall staff, that, and moving forward, with the override commitments, but especially with town services side, which the override didn't really, in my opinion, contain really that much money, but the residents of the town, as well as the town administration, have a certain level of service that, not only do they want to continue, but in some areas, enhance. And I know that's a brand new dance for both of you. This is sort of your first flying solo year on that, so I do appreciate the time that you've put into this, you've given to us here tonight, and as I said to Mr. McGee about a week or so ago, and Mr. Feeney knows this, I'm certainly going to be scheduling some time, not at the select board meeting, just to go a little further in depth, maybe the beginning of March, if appropriate, to save everybody sort of the background nuts and bolts of this, but in light of the projected shortfall and some of the other commitments that I know we're really going to have to find a way to balance, I really do feel encouraged and glass half full, or in my case, I'm just happy to have a glass, you know, if there's anything in there, that's a bonus, but I feel very well taken care of under the steed of our town finance director, deputy town manager and town manager, so thank you, and thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mrs. Mahan, and our colleague over Zoom, Mr. Diggins.</blockquote>

This takes us to item six and seven. Both of these are public hearings. And we have the community development block grant. A performance update for the program year 2023 and 2024 is the first one. And this is Mary Mazinski, community development block grant administrator. It's wonderful to have you this evening. Thank you. I hope I got your last name close to right. It was perfect.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Mary Muszynski - 619</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Well, good evening. I'm Mary Mazinski, the community development block grant administrator, or we call it CDBG, with the Department of Planning and Community Development. So first, I'll present the mid-year report and a summary of applications, and then a summary of applications for the upcoming program year for the board's endorsement. Then the program year 50 applicants will have the opportunity to present an overview of their proposed programs and activities. This currently is the 49th consecutive year that Arlington has received HUD funding through the CDBG program. We are currently in year four of our five-year consolidated plan. Arlington is on track to meet the CDBG goals the community set to accomplish for this five-year plan period. The goals for economic development have already been exceeded. There are a wide range of uses that benefit Arlington residents, especially households with low and moderate incomes. Over $1 million has been allocated to the affordable housing, public parks and infrastructure, and public services just this year. Some highlights from the mid-year report by category include, for affordable housing projects, Housing Corporation of Arlington is using grant funds carried over from previous years to continue capital improvement projects within their affordable housing portfolio. HCA's program year 49 projects are at midpoint and on schedule. HCA's projects completed so far this year include window replacements and a replacement of a failed chimney. Arlington Housing Authority has undertaken a large capital improvement projects at Hauser Building at Brick Village. The program year 48 roof replacement project is expected to be completed this spring. And the program 49 building exhaust fan project will go out to bid this month. Caritas communities projects have been delayed due to staff turnover and supply chain issues. Their program year 47 capital improvements were completed in September. And their program 48 improvements, which include a kitchen renovation and seven bathroom renovation, are expected to be completed this month. And then for public service programming, which provides essential health, recreation, employment training, after school, and transportation services, CDBG public service goals are measured by the number of low to moderate income participants who have benefited from their program. At midpoint this year, 617 Arlington residents have benefited from CDBG funded public service activities. This represents about 46% of the collective goal for public services for program year 49. All public service activities are on track to accomplish their goals by the end of the program year. Notably, the Boys and Girls Club scholarship program has already exceeded their goal for the year. Arlington Youth Counseling Center, Arlington's Council on Aging Volunteer Coordinator program, the Recreation Department scholarship program, and Fidelity House's Mononomy Manor Outreach, and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs programs have achieved more than 50% of their goals by midyear. And then for public facilities and improvements, the Robbins Memorial Flagstaff Plaza at Town Hall project was completed in October. Food Link's solar panel project was completed in July, and their new solar panels went live in August. And Robbins Library ADA accessible restroom project is being prepared to go out to bid. And then under planning and administration, that's our final category, the Department of Planning and Community Development manages a number of CDBG funded projects. The Planning Department is in the preliminary stage of the town's master plan update process, working to develop additional plans for the Arlington Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and conducting analysis to advance recommendations for Connect Arlington, Net Action Plan, and Affordable Housing Action Plan. And then lastly, Envision Arlington released the annual town survey in January, and the survey is available to take online until March 4th. So that concludes the CDBG midyear report. Do we have any questions or comments?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much indeed. Mr. Hurd. Just one question. I don't know if you know the answer, but for the scholarships for the boys club, how are they exceeding the anticipated? Are they reducing the amount of the scholarships that they're giving? They must have, because their initial goal, or it was configured differently, because their initial goal was to assist, I believe, 55 individuals, and they wound up assisting 77. OK. Yes. Seems like with a set amount of a scholarship, you can't go over that, but I'm sure they figured it out. There are several different programs too, so it might vary that way as well. OK. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Mary Muszynski - 358</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. We'll continue on with the overview of the program year 50 funding requests. So in recent years, Arlington has received an entitlement grant of just over $1 million. We plan to receive the grant of this size again this year for program year 50. We estimate the program income for the upcoming year will not be more than about $12,000. The program income funds that have been trending downward, as there are only eight remaining Arlington home rehab loans generating interest. So the grant awards will be budgeted accordingly. So for this application period, we received 18 applications, including new and returning applicants and projects. The full application portfolio is included with tonight's meeting materials and available for review. We received applications for two new public facilities and improvement projects this year. One is a green infrastructure project to complete a flood resilience design for the Lower Mill Brook and a project to redesign the Foot of the Rocks Parklet at Mass Ave and Lowell Street. And then the Department of Planning and Community Development requests for funding includes CDBG program administration and a portion of the planner salaries while working on CDBG related activities. These activities involve data gathering and analysis, survey creation and implementation, community engagement, land use planning and zoning activities, and affordable housing studies and plan implementation. Planning objectives for program year 50 include long range planning for housing and community development studies to help in the creation and preservation of affordable housing, to help provide other benefits and to help provide other benefits to low and moderate income population of Arlington. And then also, of course, the development of a comprehensive master plan update. So the next step in the application process is for the CDBG subcommittee to meet again and then to draft a budget recommendation which will present it to the board for endorsement. I want to thank you for your time. I'm happy to answer any other questions. And at this time, I'd like to request that the public hearing be turned over for applicants and they'll be invited to share a brief overview of their proposals. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Lisa Urban. I work at Fidelity House. And I'm noticing this chair. I hope it doesn't cause me to talk longer because I'm a little more comfortable, which you might be finding with, I guess, a lot of people. I just want to thank you for your past support and also for the opportunity to ask again this year. I know it may seem similar, oh, she comes every year and asks. But the program itself addresses it's new every year. Like, we're going to get kids that it's their first time coming. It's not new. It's new to them. It's not same old, same old. And then even the kids that come back that we're trying to help are at a different stage in life that they were a year ago and have different needs. And hopefully are a little bit more active in becoming a part of the community. One thing that we do, a couple of things. I put two applications in. One is for our outreach program, Menominee Manor Outreach Program. And it's threefold. We do an on-site program for, and it addresses a little bit younger kids, too, that can't come to Fidelity House or can't get there. And also parents who may not want their kids traveling. So it's a chance for us to meet the kids right in their neighborhood. And then during the school year, we provide scholarships for all our different programs. So whatever their needs are and interests. And then during the school year, or sorry, during the summer, we have a day camp. And we really, we provide the transportation. We go down. We bring them to Fidelity House. And then they go to our summer day camp, swimming lessons, nature. You know, it's an old-fashioned feel. It's archery. It's being with everyone else and learning and being a kid. And then we make sure they get home by transportation also. And we found that transportation and just experiencing camp has been huge. And we've had a great amount of kids that do it every year. And if I could, I'd ask for double the amount. Because what we're finding is we're getting a ton of kids. And we can only give them each a week. Because, you know, do you give one more to some kids than others? We want to make sure. So we're getting the quantity, but we really are trying to get a little bit more quality, too, where they're here longer. I mean, 100% want to come to camp longer. And I don't blame them. It's fun. It's great. But reality is what it is. So I did put in a request for $21,000. And then we have that Jobs, Jobs, Jobs program that doesn't seem like it addresses a lot. But those staff that we are able to get really have an impact on the kids and really on the families. You know, the funding that they get, they really use to help their family, too. So it really is something that benefits us, benefits the kids, benefits the family. So it may seem like it's, oh, it's a small thing. But it really has a big impact. So I just want to say thank you. And hopefully it happens again this year. And thanks for your time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the work you do in the community. And do we have anybody else in the room who wants to comment? Come on up. Reset my three-minute timer. That was exactly three minutes. Well done. Hello, everyone. I'm Andy Doan with Arlington Eats. Good to be here tonight. We applied for program funding. This is the first time since, I think, 2020. Because I know that the budget is very small for program funding. And there's a lot of great organizations. In fact, all the applicants are partners of ours. So it's a small amount of money. But there's a lot of meat out there. So I felt like it was important for us to demonstrate the need that we're seeing in the community right now. So many of you know that we moved into our brand new facility a year ago. And in the past year, we've seen a 35% increase in the number of families we're seeing. So we're now seeing between 425 and 450 families every week in our market and home delivery programs. And we recently learned from the Greater Boston Food Bank that the number of Arlington residents and households that are food insecure is 20%. That's more than double, almost three times as many as 2021. I mean, we all feel it when we go to the grocery store, right? You get to the checkout counter, you see your receipt, and you're like, how can this be that I'm spending this much on groceries? And so this is even more of a hardship for many of our residents here in Arlington. And that's why we're here to provide services. We spend $300,000 just on food in our annual budget. So we requested $30,000. That's kind of a drop in the bucket to be able to provide the fresh produce and meat and dairy and items that we aren't able to get donated that we do have to purchase. But just lastly, I want to mention that we had a couple of our guests provide letters of support for our application this year. And one particular woman is a volunteer and a board member and a guest. And she is a professional musician. And her small business does not have regular steady income. She gives lessons, she performances, it's up and down. And so she has turned Arlington Eats for a reliable place to get her food. So there's so many of our residents that are coming to us. And we hope that we can find ways to partner with the town to address this need. Thank you. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Schaaf - 773</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for everything that you do. It's good to see you. Do we have anybody else in the room who wishes to comment before we turn to Zoom? OK, so let's start with Christine Schaaf for the remote participants. Good evening, Ms. Schaaf. Good evening, everybody. It's nice to see you all from afar, but good to see you. I'm Christine Schaaf, the executive director of the Council on Aging. And I do also really enjoy being here every year to present our CDBG applications. We rely heavily on the CDBG every year. This year is no exception. We have submitted our three applications. And I wanted to take just a couple minutes to remind you all of the good work that's funded by CDBG every year. A big chunk, two out of the three of our applications, are focused on our transportation program and the volunteers that help make it run, and the staff position that has both of those functions. So our transportation program is an enterprise fund in the town. CDBG every year helps us with a $30,000 grant to offset the income for the Enterprise Fund for Transportation. Just to give you a snapshot, I did include in the materials just one day of what our van schedule looks like. I think it is very telling to see the amount of rides that just two eight-passenger vans that you probably see around town do every day. We provide about 9,000 rides per year. And it was good to see Andy Doan just right before me, but we are the transportation partner for Arlington Eats. And almost 300 rides per week we do for Arlington Eats visitors as well. We have, like I said, the two vans, we have partnerships with the local taxi company for a discount taxi coupons. And we also have a great partnership with Uber as more people start in the older adult age range using cell phones. We help them with an Uber. You don't need to have a cell phone to do that, but we're trying to do that as much as we can for out-of-town medical rides, especially when people need to get there outside of the van hours. We've increased our volunteer drivers as well, because as you all know, there's hardly anything that replaces a reliable person that will drive you to your medical appointment, make sure you get where you need to go, and take you home afterwards with that personal touch. And we also do a lot of things for people helping with their transportation, such as getting their MBTA Discount Senior Charlie Cards for them, and really anything that they need transportation-wise, they call us and we help match them to the transportation program that works best for them. And we try to allow people to have as much choice as possible. We have an absolutely wonderful volunteer and transportation coordinator who's been with us now since before the pandemic, and that position is the second application. She not only manages all of the transportation and volunteers for the transportation, but also an additional 200-plus volunteers that run all of the COA programs throughout the year. So that position is, I would say, vital to us. It's a 28-hour-a-week position, and other staff fill in that need in the off hours as well. Finally, the third application is focused on adult day health programs with our partner, Cooperative Elder Services, Inc., on Broadway. They are a longtime partner of ours, and really the work that they do in their facility is work that we cannot do at the community center through the Council on Aging. They serve people that have much higher needs than we have the capacity to deal with. They do excellent work and excellent programs all day. And what these scholarships do under this application is allow Arlington residents to try out their services for roughly—it's about 12 days of service. So if there was a family that seemed like they'd be a great fit, we would help them and connect them and get them a scholarship so they could try it out for 12 days. So we have a close partnership with them, and there are many Arlington families that didn't know what an adult day health program was that were able to get connected because of these scholarships. So thank you very much for all of the support over the years. I appreciate it. Very good, and I think we'll be seeing you a little bit later. Let's go next to Kimberly Serra, Operation Success. Welcome. Hi, everybody. Thanks for having me.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kimberly Serra - 500</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my name's Kimberly Serra. I'm an Arlington public schools teacher. This is actually year 11 for me. But in the last few years, I've taken over Operation Success from Jana McGuire, and CDBG has been doing a great job ever since Operation Success opened to helping fund school supplies and office supplies for the kids. Our proposal looks a little bit different this year. For those of you that don't know, we provide academic assistance for students that live in Monotomy Manor in grades 6 to 12 Monday through Thursday from 7 to 830 from volunteer teachers that work in APS. And so far since this opened back in, like, 1999, we've been doing that. We've seen success with it. And we shut down during COVID, and since then our numbers have been growing and growing and growing. And one of the things we're asking for this year is not only help funding the school supplies and the office supplies, but we've also seen the importance of having students that live in low-income housing be able to access events that their peers and their friends do as well that are talked about at school. But also part of our ask is some money to go to events and life skills classes, like take them to a Massachusetts-based sporting event or take them to a cooking class or something like that. I've seen firsthand in my classroom what students that cannot afford to do things like their peers, what impact that has on them. And we're trying to really support these kids both academically and socially, emotionally. And we think that's a really big part of making sure they are feeling connected to their community. So, for instance, we did a fundraiser last year, and this year we actually used some of those funds to take the students to a Celtics game last week. And it was some of the best times these kids have ever had. We have great pictures of it. They loved everything about it. And I actually saw the kids the night after we took them, and so many of them at Homework Club were saying how much all of their friends asked about it and how connected they were feeling to kids at school because of that experience. So we're definitely still on the academic side of things and making sure they're getting their study skills, their time management skills, executive functioning. Like, that is our primary purpose. But in addition to that, we're trying to support their social, emotional well-being and their connection to the community. So that's why our proposal looks a little bit different this year. Does anyone have any questions for me I can help answer? Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here and taking time out of your evening. It is literally a school night, so thank you for the work that you do, and thanks for being here this evening. No problem. Thanks for all this work.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Erica Schwartz - 696</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Anyone else in Zoom that wants to comment on the applications, please do raise your hand in Zoom. Okay. Ms. Mark? I see a hand raised. Oh, there we go. A couple of hands raised. Yep. I'm just going to promote that. Let's bring in Mr. Nagel and Ms. Schwartz. And let's give a raise and see who can turn their microphone on first. Let's go with Ms. Schwartz. There we go. Good evening, Ms. Schwartz. I need to unmute. Sorry about that. Hi. Thank you. I'm Erica Schwartz, the Executive Director of the Housing Corporation of Arlington. And we have applied for funds, CDBG funds, for improvements to our existing portfolio. So largely for time-sensitive capital repairs at, you know, we have 150 units in our portfolio, but 102 of them are the older units built between 1826 and 1966. So it's a tricky portfolio because there's so many buildings between, you know, two families, four to five-unit buildings, nine-unit buildings, and then Capital Square, our 32-unit site that's also older. And they all have very different needs, so it sort of takes a lot to maintain that. So in the past, we've done new windows, new roof, chimneys, porches, exterior stairs. When there's unit turnover, especially if a tenant's been there a long time or they've just been a little tough on the unit, sometimes we need to do new flooring or cabinetry, drywall repair. You know, building to building, it can be very different. So we, just for some context, we are in the process of working on a capital needs assessment. And I realize last year I had said the same thing, but I was only about seven months on the job and really underestimated all the demands on my time and the complexity of figuring out how to do a capital needs assessment on a portfolio that's as diverse as ours. It's really, we needed to take a slightly different approach than would be typical because of how scattered site it is. So that is actually finally underway now, and we're really looking at, you know, big picture plans, big improvements we need to make, and we'll be putting together a much larger, you know, financing plan for that. But in the meanwhile, we do have these needs that come up that the CDBG funds are so essential to make sure that we're staying on top of those. So, and we're not just looking to the town, you know, even for these nearer term things or for the larger term, you know, sort of longer term plan. I have some free technical assistance that I've gotten from the National Housing Trust to help us think in particular about energy efficiency. There's a foundation that might be interested in supporting us. They've invited me to submit a grant that might be $50,000. So we're trying to leverage all the money we can because the needs are great. As much money as the town can give, like, we'll spend it. As you can imagine, you know, it's not cheap to do any of these small projects, and they all add up on our portfolio. So, you know, I heard Mary give the report. Technically, from her reporting, you know, we haven't fully expended all the money yet, and in reality, we have a project that's finishing any day now, and we just have to get the paperwork in. So there was a lull in us spending in the past in the executive director transition before I came, and now we're pretty much spending it as soon as you approve it, we've been spending it. So this is really vital funding to keep our properties safe, sustainable for the long term, you know, keep them maintained as we, in this moment, sort of look to make this larger plan where we'll be looking more at, you know, HVAC systems and foundation issues and sort of some of the really big ticket items. But this money in the meanwhile is so essential for these, not necessarily even smaller projects, but significant projects like windows, roofs, porches, stairs, turnover, that kind of thing. Thanks.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Nagel - 464</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent. Thank you very much. Thank you for your good work. And I think finally we have Mr. Nagel from the Housing Authority. Good evening, Mr. Nagel. Good to see you. Good evening. Thank you very much. On behalf of the Arlington Housing Authority Board of Commissioners, I'd like to thank you for all your past support, not only for the, you know, critical capital needs that we need at the Housing Authority to preserve our portfolio, but also for operation success, but also for these other organizations here that directly benefit our residents on a daily basis. The project that we're proposing this year is a repaving project at Drake Village. The current parking lots there are original to when the development was, to when Hauser Building was built in 1975. What we're finding at this point is that the amount of wear and tear at the parking lots has reached the point where patching and just ongoing ways to try to prolong the life of it are no longer working. So what we're proposing is a complete repavement, which will help us not only address some of these health and safety concerns, but upgrade the parking lot surface so that it's accessible for the residents of our developments that greatly need that, as well as ensure that some of the crosswalks that we just added are evenly paved, so it's going to be for those individuals that are crossing as well. One of the things that's unique about this project for the Housing Authority is that it's not only going to benefit the residents of the Housing Authority and those that visit the Housing Authority, but it's going to benefit the greater community. And the reason I say that is that Drake Village is a unique property in that it straddles the bike path, as well as the Arlington Reservoir and Mass Ave. So it's really a vital junction point between these three resources in Arlington. So by repaving and upgrading this surface here at Drake Village, it's going to make it safer for the pedestrians that use our parking lot and roadway on a daily basis. What I'm hoping to do is be able to work with the DPW to figure out when they may be planning to pave the town of Arlington's portion of that road. A great ask, but something I'm definitely going to continue to work with them on. And some of the other things that we'll be working on with this project are any stormwater mitigation that's needed. And one thing we're pretty excited about is looking into adding some EV charging stations, too, and looking at grants to do that. But thank you again for all your past support, and have a good night. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 202</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hurd. Yeah, I would just say we did subcommittee last week to go over the proposals, and in my years on the board, I don't think we've ever had to cut so much as far as the funds that we have available and the requests. It's always an amazing experience to be able to go through these and fund as many programs as we can, because all these programs have an absolute direct effect on residents in the town. And as opposed to the overarching budget that we talked about earlier, it's $5,000, and it's $5,000 that immediately gets put into the community and has about as much impact as $5,000 will have at any municipal level. But that said, we have $1.6 million-plus of requests for about $1 million to give out, so unfortunately we're going to have to tighten the budget. But when we do that, we don't want to cut out any individual program, but everything will have to scale back a little bit, unfortunately. I do thank everyone for coming and for submitting your requests, and we will get to work on this in the next couple weeks to get some recommendations together for the full board.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 549</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mahon. That's the other half. That's the other half of our delegation. On the CDBG subcommittee, I want to thank Mr. Hurd for really taking the lead. I was having some technical difficulties, but at our last subcommittee meeting, as he stated, the $1.6 million in the requests and the $1 million available. One of the things that's really always frustrated me, but you have to live within the pyramid as you're given, is only 15% of that, which means if we only get $1 million, it's $150,000 can go to public services, which we'd love to quadruple if we could, but we're under the limits. Then one of the other things that were discussed that only affected one or two projects, well, one facet was, as Ms. Schwartz outlined in her presentation, questions came up about whether CDBG was the sole funding, and are they looking for other sources and grants and ways to mitigate the costs, which each and every one of these pretty much do. Then the other last two questions that were out there before we meet again, one was sort of a global one, which is the town manager and Ms. Muszynski and Ms. Ricker, the planning director, going back and looking at their budgets to see, similar to what we ask our nonprofits and others, is any of the expense, can it sort of be added on to something else, where we anticipate we're going to have to make such a drastic cut because the monies are going down because the pool of CDBG cities and towns are going up, but the funding has pretty much stayed the same. One of the questions, and I don't know if we can ask the chair to go back and his co-chair of the Community Preservation Act, but in terms of their process, I think they're in their hearings right now. Do you remember, if the CPA Committee sticks to sort of the time parameter that they've outlined, do they usually have, because one or two of these requests are also tied into possible Community Preservation Act, do you know, do they come out in January, February, March? I'm not going to hold you to it, but, or is it as late as April? In past practice, it's usually been early March. Early March. But I encourage you to speak with the chair of the body, who you might know. Yes, yes. Because, like, Foot of the Rocks and some of the other ones. Yeah, exactly. To work out the overlap. And then the manager also indicated, along with his department heads, to see if there are any requests that if we can't fill them, I don't know, I know they're investigating other things under the budget, but also if any of these are one-time requests that could somehow fall into OPERA if we meet the federal guidelines, and that's a really big if. But the manager and his staff did indicate that they're going to really go back and look and try to, because that's a big cut, big hit, you know, 1.65, 1.646 requests in about a million that we have to give out. So, but we'll find a way. We will persevere. So, thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, Mr. Hurd.</blockquote>

Chaplain worked on this I Think there's a feeling As I'll present here that we're being over assessed and have been for a long time and So that the committee the MBTA Communities Act Classifies as an adjacent community Which is in direct opposition to what we are Classified as far as the assessment so that so that that I think needs to be remedied and this might be how how how you decide to do it it could be directly or If I had been more On the ball last month I a home rule petition might might be something that makes the legislature have to pay attention So, let's look at this chart, okay, let's look at the bottom half first These are towns and cities Belmont Medford Somerville and Cambridge that are all in the MBTA communities Related either as commuter rail that Belmont or all the others are rapid transit Which is the highest rating the lowest is adjacent in our neighborhood and then you have commuter rail and then you have rapid transit which can also include bus and and commuter rail as well So if you take those and you do by population You prorate to Arlington you see that the numbers are all about three million three and a half million plus or minus So that that that system seems to work pretty well, but if you look at the top of the chart You see that Arlington is paying as much as Those as it would if it was if it had commuter rail or rapid transit for our bus service which seems to me to be ill advised if you take Lexington's Which has only bus service and it is an adjacent community and you prorate that you get 1.1 million and Winchester is getting away with bloody murder Because they have commuter rail and bus service and they only pay $564,000 if you prorate that you also get 1.1 million dollars for us So this could be two and two million dollars that that we're overpaying every year and I've been here 22 years that's 44 million dollars and we could do a lot of other things with So I think this is something that because of the change with the MBK communities it's worth considering there's obviously the town council will help with the legislation differences and The town manager the board can decide how best to do it. But if there were to be a special town meeting Called this this spring this be a place where that might be a slot and I'd be happy to vote for it</blockquote>

let's now move to traffic rules and orders and other business and we have item 8 an update and a potential vote of approval or endorsement The bike lane design guide from John Alessi's union transportation planner and his team and while they come up to the table I just want to Commend, mr. Lessie for the process. I was fortunate to be invited to participate in in it for a couple of meetings and I thought that you know I learned a lot through that and was glad to see a lot of participation by Lots of different stakeholders from the town in the community. So please tell us what you've got tonight and introduce your guests

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank You. Mr. Chair So good evening select board members. My name is John Alessi I'm the senior transportation planner and the Department of Planning and Community Development I'm joined tonight by the town's consultants at tool design. I have Sneha Adhikari. Yes Stephanie wire here from tool design To present on the recently completed bike facility design guide for repaving and restriping projects Just yeah, just just we can we can take a Gracious pause for a moment while we get our screens ready Just hang just hang tight. Sounds good. Thank you deep breath or Oh Here we go. Thank you. So so this guide will supersede the context and by the way This guide will supersede the context sensitive Bike facility design guide matrix that was developed by the Transportation Advisory Committee and approved by the select board in 2015 This is also a project that was started my by my predecessor Daniel Amstutz and I've had the pleasure of bringing it to completion So I'd like to thank our consultants at tool design who have assisted in the project's development and have helped integrate feedback from residents town committee members and town departments into this guide and I'd also like to note that any project that comes out of this guide Requiring select board approval will be brought before as needed similar to the Medford Street bike lane project That was approved by this board last year So with that I'd like to pass it off to Sneha who's going to speak about the guide and we'd be happy to answer any questions afterward</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Thank you. I'm happy to be here to present The final version of our bike guide and give you a little bit of a summary so I'll go over project goals a little bit give you a breakdown on a Timeline and then do a little bit of a summary of the content in the short shortest amount of time I can I can do it Next slide, please We already on this so John has been our project manager and Stephanie and I have been here at tool design Working on this project next slide so just to orient us towards the goal as John has mentioned the really the real purpose of this guide is to provide Clear indication to town department public works on implementation of bike lanes that is context sensitive and is prioritizing safety of all roadway users now this update was needed So that it would adhere more to recent standards a lot of the state and federal Bike lane standards and guidelines and even funding programs have changed and increasingly a lot of them are requiring preference for more Separated or protected bike lanes and the list of those guidelines and some of the grants are listed over there next slide Another big goal of this project was to ensure that there is more coordination happening And identify how the town planning and community development department can be incorporated into design project projects and some decision-making around that and Finally, we really wanted this guide to align with plans and goals outlined in other planning documents including Specifically the connect Arlington transportation plan So just to give you an overview on what we've been working on since the summer of 2023 So we kicked off the project with John at that time In August we had our first subcommittee meeting and this subcommittee meeting You know really involved a lot of different groups within Arlington including an Arlington parent a back and member Arlington Police Department member someone from everywhere Arlington. We also had mr. Helmuth as our select board member a high school student and a bike rider So we're trying to really capture the experience of a lot of people living in Arlington and a lot of different stakeholders So we met with them in August and they give us they gave us a lot of good feedback on what kinds of things they would want to see in a new bike guide and After that, we developed the draft bike guy in the in the months of August and September We had our second subcommittee meeting on October where we shared the draft. I guide and we also shared it with our the public works department as well as Tack and a back members who reviewed it and gave us a lot of good comments that fed into the final bike guide that we finalized earlier this year next slide Great. So now let's get into the actual content. Hopefully y'all had some time to like look over it So I'll give you a little bit of an overview So really the design guide is structured in in the way that you can see on this chart So at first it gives a breakdown on different bike facility types it then talks about methodology around how you would go about selecting the bike facility and then it gives The actual matrix which has step-by-step instructions on how you would go about choosing a bike Facility and one thing I want to note which you know was on the top of the bike guide was that this is for restriping And we paving projects So we've like made sure that it any recommendations we're providing in here is fitting within that context So just to go over some bike facility types Starting out with separated bike lanes, and I'm showing like a little cross-section of each of the design types on this table as well Separated bike lanes are bike lanes that provide exclusive space for people biking and it's physically separated from vehicular travel using vertical elements Now they may be implemented at street level with paint and flexible delineators So that's what you can see on the chart over there And it can be done as a part of repaving and restriping project as a result of being able to do it using these temporary materials Next up we have conventional and buffered bike lanes. These are also on street bike lanes delineated from traveling with just pavement markings Buffered bike lanes use a buffer striping and that's the image you're seeing on the right-hand side while conventional bike lanes are delineated with just a single line to denote use for bike travel and Then finally we have bike boulevards. These are interesting. They are meant for low volume low speed streets designed to prioritize bike travel They really incorporate a whole host of treatments working together including Signage including pavement markings and traffic calming measures intended to ensure that speeds through these roads are not high So things like speed humps and chicane to really ensure that that low speed nature of the street is preserved while people are biking around the street Next slide So going into the matrix itself so the first question that is asked in the matrix is if the Street in the town is in the town's recommended bike network Now the bike network the recommended bike network was in the connect Arlington plan. It was identified The streets identified on it had gone through some analysis in terms of it being a priority street for biking So definitely if the street is part of that network, you'd want to consider it for a bike facility the other thing that we added was If the street is a primary route to existing schools parks libraries and regional transit That should also be prioritized as for connect Arlington since those locations are important locations to connect with bike facilities The next part of the matrix looks at really understanding the existing characteristics of the roadway So it asks what the vehicular volume and speed of the street is studies have shown that You know speed and volume of the roadway is closely linked to the comfort that people feel while biking and you can probably You know feel that When the volumes are really high and the speeds are really high. It is not as much of a safe environment So you would signal a need for a more separated facility The chart that you're seeing on the left there is from the FHWA Bikeway selection guide and it kind of breaks down what those numbers would look like so in our case here if you have if you're having a street that has volumes over 2,000 vehicles per day and Speeds over 25 miles per hour It really signals a need for a bike lane whether that is separated bike lane or a conventional or buffered bike lane And certainly if the volumes and speeds are exceeding that it You know grants for more separation next line So assuming that you know, we meet the criteria of those thresholds of the speed and the volume It then the matrix will then ask about the curb to curb width of the street And the matrix really compares it to the minimum Separated bike lane dimension and I've mentioned this before but connect Arlington and all a lot of other plans have really Emphasize the need for a prior priority around separated bike lanes So the first comparison that it's doing is with a separated bike lane And if the separated bike lane a minimum dimension is not it is met Then it prompts you to a table that really digs into how Other uses like parking can Go with the bike lane if the separated bike lane minimum dimension is not met meaning the existing Broadway width is narrower than that then you compare it to a Conventional bike lane and the and the widths and if that is met it pulls you to another table Which has a conventional bike lane table, and I know this all sounds like super wordy because it's hard to explain But it is hopefully clearly laid out in the actual guide itself If you go to the next slide It provides a little bit of context around where those numbers are coming from This is taken directly from the guide so you can see on the first row there We're talking about separated bike lane and sort of the assumptions around the minimum widths of the travel lane bike lane buffer And then you get a minimum that's 34 to 36 feet Similarly for the conventional bike lane that absolute minimum is 30 to 32 feet But you know if you are looking to see how parking or curbside use could fit within these both of these facilities Then you're gonna have to account for that additional width and compare it against that additional width Next slide so really the The last one I wanted to mention related to the matrix was that it suggests the need for some reallocation of the roadway to provide a facility that is really safe and sometimes that might might mean to me that we have to make compromises on available parking and As such I know that that's you know a topic that is very very timely and a lot of people care about that So what the matrix does is really recommends coordination with John and town planning department to Address like how the changes in parking could look like and certainly any removal of parking will be studied on a case-by-case basis next And finally, you know the bike I we're really trying to make sure that what the DPW Is looking at what the DPW department is looking for is captured in the guide as well One of the things that they mentioned was guidance around green pavement and how bike crossing should be Designed and we've included some guidance around that. We've also included some guidance around if the roadway width is inconsistent or it's like You know constrained like what are some? Strategies that you could consider so that there is some consistency in the The network that you're providing and finally it also provides some Opportunities integrate facilities with bus transit in the form of like a floating bus stop that could work well with a bike facility All right, so that was my really quick summary, thank you for giving us the opportunity to present here today We're really hopeful that The new guide will provide that clear direction on the implementation of bike lanes that is really looking at prioritizing safety and is forward-thinking and looking to the future</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Thank you. Mr Chair as mr. Alessi alluded to to open the presentation. This is Really a tool that will be used By our engineering division from sort of the get-go as they plan roadway reconstruction or resurfacing projects to understand what the subsequent marking Plan may look like and that happens each year under our capital plan. I think what's worth noting is right this provides a A matrix by which to make decisions obviously those decisions need to be context-specific to wit to whichever road it is is being planned and With that, you know, I would remind the board that as mr. Alessi also alluded to similar to the Medford Street project were there to be a significant change in sort of the width of the road that specific project would be Before this board were to have some Implication on parking for example for the board to consider That particular project in context and to have a say in that particular project at that time</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Heard, thank you. Thank you for the presentation. I will move endorsement That's sufficient. Yep I Mean I think everything in here is very much in line with Arlington's Continued efforts that we've done over the past 15 years starting way back with the Mass Ave project in East Arlington in our continued commitment to Increasing bike infrastructure and connect Arlington, which is very important to residents I think You know, this has been said a few times I think this is this thing encompasses our Designed thoughts for how we want Arlington to look as projects move forward any individual projects comes before the board on a case-by-case basis and Everything relative to roadways is like economics It's a efficient allocation of scarce resources in this town Our roadways are certainly scarce resources And you know, I think we have very smart people who work on these projects that try to put together the best best infrastructure for Getting people to move along for safety and for all the considerations that go along with With our roadway improvements for all residents and people use the town of Arlington. So Happy to support this. I think I like what it does. I think it gives some clear directive and avoids some confusion that can come up sometimes when when we have these projects, so Thank you again for all your time on this</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. DeCoursey, thank you. Mr. Chairman. I'll second. Mr. Hurd's motion and thank you for the presentation tonight just a question on I see in the matrix and in your presentation this evening on separated bike lanes that I do see a picture in there on the floating bus stops there was a two-way separated bike lane is that and but I don't see it anywhere in terms of the analysis is that something based on what you've seen in Arlington that you you wouldn't recommend for analysis like you would just stop on the one way or is it is there guidance there to try to determine that if if the right street came about yeah that's really good question I think that was just a nice picture I found to clearly demonstrate the context it can certainly be done with a bike lane that's going one one way in each direction the way the context in which I've seen that is it really works well when you have parking adjacent to the bike lane so if your parking lane then you have the buffer lane than the bike lane and when you're approaching an intersection we it's it's often a good practice to give some space for visibility for so that parked cars are not like right next to the crosswalk anyway so I can see it in the context where you have a bus stop that's next to the crosswalk and that that parking that one parking space in that buffer space becomes this island that can then be the space that people can which is I think what is shown in the in the guide but it's shown as a two-way facility you can do it with a one-way as well okay all right thank you yeah any other comments questions for the board</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mr. Diggins so thank you mean and I got to see this meet through uptack and through everywhere our little streets one question I didn't ask mean and you mentioned that this has been prompted by you know in different improved standards which back to bike lanes I mean how do you recommend we go about keeping this updated missile I see so that's a good question mr. Diggins so I'd say that this guide was created since the previous matrix was completed almost nine years ago and you know standards change over time I'd say that a good opportunity to revisit this guide would be probably in the next five to ten years depending on the change of guidelines from both the state level at MassDOT and at the federal level I'm not sure if my consultants want to speak to I don't know the change in guidelines that's happening nowadays but I'd say that we're kind of at a point where bike facilities are becoming more you know progressive in terms of design so I would say that moving forward I will you know keep up to date with how guidelines are changing and as appropriate we'll coordinate with my colleagues in the department to update the guide as needed thank you very much I think I think I heard mr. Alessi just say he'd be here for ten years I appreciate this as well I really like I like something my colleague mr. Hurd said which is that this is a really a good depiction among many of the purposes of what we want the town to look like I think that's really important in a big picture and it's a statement of vision and I agree with everything the town manager said and others said that you know we have to make these on the ground these decisions are tight they're tough they are full of compromises we've experienced that that's going to continue but I you know I feel really good that the town is sending a clear message to its residents and to its departments to staff that you know that we get we get this we like having guidelines that are up-to-date we like promoting bicycling as a viable increasingly safe way of getting around town and so I'm real excited to see this work continue as well</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 689</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mrs. Mahan sorry I missed you before no I'm trying not speak unless somebody else asked my question now and I know mr. Hurd made the motion and mr. DeCoursey already seconded so I put if that wasn't already done I preface that so now with this bike lane design guide I know there's different verbiage in there in terms of what the guidelines are and what will be evaluated how decisions will be made and I think in one spot I think it was parking case-by-case basis my sort of process question is with this guide in place who and or what department or departments town manager or select board in terms of the issues that different opinions in the community arise who has the final say I'm not saying that appropriately but with this guide in place only because I remember years ago Alan McLennan who was our planning director at the time came in with a hundred and six page planning open space plan and I advocated against it for many reasons and oh no just endorse this and then there were other things that were totally out of our hands but we had to carry the the buckets of water on it so would you be submissive I'd like to direct that question to the town manager sure I think that's a fair question with respect to where we're going next in the capital plan obviously we have a prioritization program for our roads that engineering develops but with respect to the you know once a location has been chosen and there are actual decisions to be made on the ground I would expect it would be the board that has the final say over you know how that curb-to-curb with is ultimately being distributed as it's been done in the past it's your question yes thank you I just wanted to read the mr. manager saying and I think that mr. heard put it well it's an endorsement by the board to authorize and kind of stand by this matrix this design plan but when future projects come up in a case-by-case basis to mrs. bonds question that will remain within the purview of the board to decide on a case-by-case basis yeah it strikes me that you know similarly to the discussions we've had in reference to connect our line to that when we get down to the specific situation we do have to look at the look at that situation on the ground and you know and understand that that's how it works I think those specific statutory interpretations and authorizations and requests still fall within the board birth boards purview under chapter 40 section 22 mr. Lansing I would just like to note that I'd like to think of this guide as more of a conversation starter amongst departments yes the intention is to have the select board be the final say when we are changing the the roadway itself but I think this is a good first step in institutionalizing an ongoing conversation between planning DPW police so that we can come to a town staff decision on what is most appropriate with approval from the select board so it will be many stakeholders who are feeding into a recommendation that's then presented to the select board so plan to see me more often thank you thank you I'm sorry oh my only other question is and I apologize miss adhikara adhikari sorry you may have said this and the pipe was banging and I didn't hear it I'm just it's just a mr. Diggins curiosity question when you talk about just the I also like the mr. DeGorsey opening preamble is a whole nother thing but anyways but when you speak about green pavement is that Greek because green means so many things is that green in terms of bicycle pedestrian or does that also include environmental flooding top topographical so it's like green paint oh it's literally green all right forget it I can you tell I've been in the CSO world thank you thank you mr. chair</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 245</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank you I want to express some appreciation I think that mr. lessee's comments were really well put to really give some context to this not only as a conversation starter but I think something you said earlier is that this is a planning document to to help the town departments understand kind of what they're going to need to do if we propose a project and I can see that generating a lot of efficiencies and understanding you know ahead of time and that's you know I'm not surprised this came from a planner it is a good planning document ultimately and I think that's it's been good to have this discussion so that we have clarity on what we're signing off on and you know that we still have our the responsibility that we have when it comes down to individual projects but that there's a tremendous value in having an updated document like this that articulates a general vision and provides the ability for the town to act in a more coordinated and efficient way way to use our resources more wisely so thank you very much any last comments from the board so we have a motion to endorse by mr. heard and seconded by mr. de Corsi attorney Cunningham yes mr. hurt yes mr. de Corsi yes mr. Diggins yes mr. helmet yes all right thank you very much thanks for your time this evening and for your good work</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    * Kristine Shah Executive Director, Council on Aging </blockquote>

that brings us to item 9 I believe we're going to have a revisit over zoom from ms. Christine Shaw this is the mid-year update on a senior parking sticker program so if miss Shaw is I don't see her in there we go and bring it in there we go in transit hello again just introduce yourself for people who may have joined late
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Shaw - 1118</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great good to see everybody again I'm Christine Shaw the executive director of the council on aging and it was you know about seven months ago that I was there in the room with over a hundred older adults in Arlington it was truthfully one of the most exciting things that we have been in a while and we were really thrilled when the select board approved a pilot of a of a COA parking sticker program so on that night we promised to roll it out in September so we did as of September 7th 2023 and I'm here tonight to give a mid-year update for your request on how how it's gone and some of the things we've learned and just really excited to share it with you so in your materials I believe you all received three different sheets like I said we started on September 7th we decided after talking to other towns that have similar programs to have one set time a week for people to come in and apply if they wanted to do that in person we also have the option for people to apply online for quite a while it was neck and neck between people applying online and people coming in person which in our demographic is always interesting to see that more and more percentage of people doing things online and less in person but as of at this was just last week when I looked at these numbers we had just over 1,500 permits that had been distributed 614 people had applied online and 911 in person so what we're seeing now is mostly in-person applications every week but we do see some online as well you may remember that the program was approved for age 65 and above at the Council on aging we have programs starting at age 60 and there was some question on if 65 was going to be something that people would talk about or you know ask about and I say it's been very minimal and I'm probably the first one that was a little surprised at that but I was expecting there to be more questions about age 60 to 65 and although we get them we've said you know as of now the programs approved for age 65 so on your 65th birthday come on in and get your sticker we have had people come like the day after their birthday which is which is exciting we also limit it to one per household so if there's two cars and one address we do make them choose which car they're going to put the sticker on again minimal minimal pushback sometimes just some brainstorming I'm like okay well we usually take this car when we go you know to the community center we usually take this car if we're driving during the day when the meters were turned on so I think you know there's some strategy that goes into it but people have had no problem sticking to the one per household and also nobody complains that there is no cost for the program I'm sure you're happy you're not surprised to hear that but it's really really great to have something that people come in the program it's very simple to apply we give them their sticker and they're just really grateful to the town for for running the program I have heard so much appreciation people who you know had never even come into the community center before have come in and they said you know this is a really great thing I it's just so easy and I'm so grateful that I just don't have to worry about downloading the app for the meters little things like that that make a huge huge difference and we've definitely felt the positive the positive commentary about the program so that part has been has been really great we have had minimal issues with replacing stickers there some due to you know weather related problems and ice scrapers and you know things like that and others related to people putting them in the wrong spot and needing to get another one to replace it but out of the 1500 ish there's been 23 due to weather related problems and 12 for other reasons I expected I was a little worried for a while on the weather related problems it was due right after a snowstorm but we talked to the company that printed the stickers and they gave us some recommendations for people putting them on in the future so hopefully that will make a improvement and if not we have been replacing them you know no problem at all there's been the parking enforcement has done such a great job there's been really minimal I've only had three people come in that got a ticket me and the other they shouldn't have with the with the sticker I expected that to be a lot more of an issue just with you know a new sticker out in the community so I really appreciate all that they've done to embrace a new sticker in town and I said a little bit about this before but the last thing I want to mention is we have had hundreds of people come in to the community center that literally said I've literally never been in this building before and while they're there they get their sticker and then they pick up a newsletter and they sign up for programs and so it is a great way and it's somewhat unintended that it gets people into our building and you know they're like wow what's going on here this is great what's that class you know and just getting them to know what we do they otherwise wouldn't have known that so it's interesting and it was at the beginning it was it was a lot of people coming in every Thursday in person it did take a lot of staff but at this point we've now trained two of our tax work off program volunteers to they they they help when people come in in person and give out the stickers on Thursday so it's been a great program that is now manageable enough for it to be volunteer run with of course staff oversight and we're there if there's any questions but that is I'd say the mid-year update and it is a pilot program I believe it was approved for a two-year pilot and you know my ask or recommendation would be that it continue but I'd love to answer any questions anybody has if there are any</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great thank you I will first turn to our colleague who is the select board representative to the thank you mr. chairman and thank you Michelle for the for the report I have to say that was one of the that the better nights I've ever had at select board that the night we approved that with all the people that came in and the interest and it's interesting it did we I was at some of the council on aging meetings and we never thought that having the sticker program would bring more people into the community center so that certainly is a great benefit and it sounds like the visibility on the stickers has worked out fairly well because there's only been three tickets that were given an error and in a small percentage as you said with the weather related problems I mean that's something maybe we look at going forward for all our sticker programs to see if it's sometime in the future maybe we would bring the sticker inside the vehicle as opposed to being outside but I'm really happy that it's worked out I've received a lot of positive feedback I did hear from one two-car household where the person who didn't get the sticker blend himself and not staying informed it is wife beat him down to the community center for the sticker but it was all he always fine with that they've worked it out but I'm glad that this is has been a positive program and thank you thank you mr. de Corsi did you move receipt of the</blockquote>

thank you for the presentation I also was going to mention mish I you can't see the gallery right now but there's nobody in the select board chambers which is a stark difference from when we heard this initially there was certainly a lot of enthusiasm we're really happy to be get the opportunity to support this then and I think you know of the people that individuals that spoke in favor a consistent theme was you know our elderly in many ways support our schools and our children through through you know property taxes and a number of other ways and this was just a small very small way for us to show our appreciation and it's certainly not surprising that there's been excellent reception amongst those who use it but I think it's a really important program to both give back but also to help promote you know 65 plus residents from driving down Arlington Center and make you know that they can get an easy parking they don't have to pay for parking they can go to a restaurant or whatnot and I think it's really important to continue to incorporate our I don't know if the word elderly is, sounds bad, but our 65 plus residents. I will say I was going over the agenda over the weekend while I was at my parents' house and my mother said, oh, we got to go in and get our stickers. So they're certainly excited about the program. And again, thank you for all the work that you do and look forward to continuing this. Thank you.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs. Mahan. Yes, thank you to Ms. Shah and Mr. DeCourcy, our representative. And I guess what I would do is, and I wouldn't expect that you're somehow keeping track of how many people between the ages of 60 and 64 come in, but I would leave it to Ms. Shah or Mr. DeCourcy, whether at the yearly update or any other time in the future, whether there are any facets of the program we want to revisit, you know, including age. And it may be 60, it may be 62, it may, whatever. And I think it's so funny that I've run into several two car households and I've had more times than not that one of the spouses have come to me because the other spouse or partner already went down and got the sticker. And I said, hey, you snooze, you lose, you know? So I'm not asking you, you know, but I'm not saying what areas of this sticker program should be revisited and revised or retuned, but I would leave it to the two of you in terms of whether it's at the yearly update or any other time from there on after. And I do appreciate you providing the numbers because I got, for some reason I had it in my head after our biggest snowstorm that we had that it was a big long discussion on several, I think three different lists that I saw about the stickers and falling off and they don't work. And then when I saw there were 23 of them, which is a little, about 2.2% of the actual numbers of stickers given out, I thought it was like in the hundreds. So I'm glad to see that that's what it was. And I'm also glad that, you know, in the cases that that did happen, that the stickers were reissued. So that's it. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Thank you very much. Anything from Mr. Diggins?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you for the report. I'm glad to see such a nice uptake on the program. I mean, and following on what Mrs. Behind suggested about me revisiting some parts of the program, what do you make of the lack of query of those between 60 and 64? We do have people ask and we say it's been approved for age 65. And, you know, it's just not been something that people have really pushed back on. I think that I try to explain the same way as I do for the two car household is, you know, the town, there's 11,000 people over age 60 in Arlington. So if all of them were able to get a parking sticker, you know, it would be a burden on the program. So we're trying to create a program that is sustainable and good for the town. There's been very few times because of the age question that I've even had to really explain that. And I think we promoted it as age 65 plus from the beginning. So people that have come, it's really only been a few that have actually come and not seen that it was age 65, I suppose. I'm sorry. So I guess my question is really, do you think there is no demand there or very little demand there? Or do you think that if the program was expanded so that the age limit was dropped, there would be demand? You think there would be demand? Yes, there definitely would be demand, yeah. Okay, all right. All right, that's good to know. You seem pretty confident about that and that's good. You know, I mean, so I think I'm just being dense here, you know, but what's the link between the program, I mean, and people who haven't been to the center coming there, I mean, I just didn't get that. I think they hear about the parking sticker or they, a lot of times we're having people come in that saw a neighbor with the sticker, even though I'm a little biased, but when I drive around Arlington, I actually notice that a lot of cars now. So I think it's a conversation starter. People ask how to get it because they'll, and so they come in on Thursday evening and they'll have never been there before. Gotcha, all right, thank you. Yep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hurd. I just want to give, we're continuing, relative to the 250 celebration, but give an update of what, of things that come, particularly this year for, in April. Within the intermunicipal group, we came up with a schedule of events for each town involved for 2025, so we can help coordinate. And so in 2024, it's meant as a sort of dry run. A lot of the towns are going to be trying to launch events that they'll do in 2025. And this year, so for the Patriot's Day celebration, we're looking at more of a week-long of events. There might be some tavern nights. We'll work with individual businesses to have, it's this location on that night, and have revolutionary era themed events on that week. And we're looking at a few other events, and a pretty significant reenactment that's in the works. We're working with town staff right now to make sure that it's feasible and safe. But just look out for things to come, because we're gonna have some pretty interesting and fun events that week. And it's coming up on us. Everyone that's involved in the planning is coming up very fast. So we'll look forward to that. But we'll have more information with concrete plans as that comes together.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Very exciting, thank you for that update. Mr. DeCorsi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, I just wanted to give a brief update. Back in September, we had a Mugar update for the board, and it mentioned that the Conservation Commission hearings would be starting. And there was an interesting development last week at the February 1st Conservation Commission meeting. The Arlington Land Trust had engaged a hydrologist to take a look at some of the test pit results and groundwater results. And that individual submitted a report that was just entered into the record last week. It was done a little while ago. And I'm just gonna read one sentence from his report. Based upon my analysis, the proposed stormwater management system will not work as designed and may result in increased groundwater levels and surface flooding. And of course, we've been looking at this issue since 2015 and opposed uniformly as a community out of flooding concerns and other concerns in the area. And one of the issues that has now come up is that there are seven or eight test pits and the reliability of the measurements on those test pits has now been put into question, had been put into question previously, but more formally through the submission of this report. And it was a recommendation that this individual made that more monitoring wells should be installed so there's more of a measurement period. And I think that's consistent with what we, our position has been as a board that if the project is ever to be approved, every single criteria must be met and every test must be met. And if there's doubt as to whether it's a test pit or a monitoring well, I say go with the monitoring well. It's not our choice here, but I will remind people who are watching that there's not gonna be a building permit issued unless there's a demonstration that there's a separation between the groundwater level and the lower foundation of whether it's parking garage or townhouses. So I spoke to the chair, the chairman about this, and I may ask to come back to the board depending on what the response is to this report for a further, maybe a comment letter to the Conservation Commission from the board. And I will say the proponent that this letter just went on the record, the proponent is gonna have an opportunity to respond to that, but it is considered a major development, something that's consistent. And I wanna commend one of the people who attended that meeting, Mr. Moore, Steve Moore, who attends a lot of our meetings, and he just really captured the essence that this has been the issue, there should be no doubt, and testing, that's something that everybody should be in agreement what the water levels are, and more testing is probably necessary. So sorry for the length there, but I thought it was, given the timing, it was important to update the board and the public on that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, thank you for that update. Mr. Diggins. Well, it's the meeting before Valentine's Day, and we haven't picked up the pattern. That's the day, that's the meeting I always wear my favorite tie. So happy Valentine's Day to all of you. It's always a pleasure spending Monday evenings with you all, so yeah, that's my new business.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Diggins. I also have a red tie, but I think I really can't, it cannot compare, so, and also it was an accident. So I also have a red tie. I'm gonna leave that one alone. I've got a couple of those that could come back out, but anyway, sorry. I think at this point we are ready to adjourn. Is anyone here to make such a motion? Motion to adjourn. All right. Second. We have a motion to adjourn by Mr. Hurd, seconded by Mr. DeCorsi, Attorney Cunningham. Mrs. Mahan. Yes. Mr. Hurd. Yes. Mr. DeCorsi. Yes. Mr. Diggins. Yes. We are adjourned. Bye-bye. Take care.</blockquote>
