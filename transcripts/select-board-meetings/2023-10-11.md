<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 409</summary>

> Good evening, I'm calling to order this meeting of the Arlington Select Board on Wednesday, October 11th. I am Select Board Chair Eric Helmuth. Tonight's meeting is being conducted in a hybrid format consistent with provision by the Massachusetts Legislature. Before we begin, please note the following. First, this meeting is being conducted in the Select Board Chambers and over Zoom. It is being recorded and simultaneously broadcast on ACMI. Second, persons wishing to join the meeting by Zoom can find information on how to do so on the Town's website. If you are participating by Zoom, you are reminded that you may be visible to others and that if you wish to participate, we ask you to provide your full name in the interest of developing a record of the meeting. The same goes for anybody who is participating in person and wishes to speak. We ask you to provide your name in the interest of developing a record of the meeting. All participants are advised that people may be listening who do not provide comment. Those persons are not asked to identify themselves. Both Zoom participants and people watching on ACMI can follow the posted agenda materials found on the Town's website, specifically the Select Board Agendas and Minutes page. So tonight we have a relatively brief agenda and I want to just point out as is my custom the opportunities for public comment tonight and some instructions about how we will do that. Tonight, none of the agenda items in my judgment require a specific public comment period. However, we do have the open forum following Item 8 in which any person can appear and speak for three minutes on a topic of their choice. At that time, anyone in the room, I'll take by a raise of hand. Anyone on Zoom who wishes to comment just needs to raise your hand in Zoom. If you do not know how to raise your hand in Zoom, now would be an excellent time to Google how to do that. Let's see how much of the Town's business we can get done tonight. Before we begin, I just want to note to my Select Board colleagues and the public that prior to the meeting, I removed one of the agenda items that had been posted. It was a resolution offered by Laura Wiener with the consent and advice of the proponents to be considered at a later time.

<details><summary>Review of Select Board Position on Mugar Development</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 147</summary>

> So what moves us to now, what is now Item 2, which is the review of the Select Board position on the Mugar development? And I just want to set the table for this just briefly. At a very recent meeting, we had, I think, a very spirited and informative and very welcomed session in which residents in that neighborhood spoke very passionately and very lucidly about their views of the continued development at Mugar. And our colleague, Mrs. Mahan at the time, requested that the Chair have an agenda item at a future meeting in which the Select Board would have the opportunity to reestablish and revisit and restate in this Select Board's current constellation its view on the Mugar development. And so I'm glad to provide that opportunity tonight for all our members, and I will turn to Mrs. Mahan, my colleague, for further comment.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 242</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. DeCorsi is sort of the lead liaison for the Mugar development, and I know we're all aware and have been following the other boards and commissions, along with department heads that have been interfacing with this project, but also recognizing that the board also has its own sort of piece of the pie defined role. But since we have done this previously, the current development, I think, is about eight or nine years before us, going through different iterations in terms of what it is. And what the board has done in the past, and I wanted to put forth before my colleagues, is just a vote, which would be that the Select Board is opposed to development of the Mugar wetlands. And I'm happy if anyone wants to expand on that, but when we first did this in discussions with previous town councils, the more you get into more language, the more you could go down the road you don't want to. So it's always just been a vote just on behalf of the Select Board. So I would make that motion, and I would ask maybe all my colleagues, and Mr. DeCorsi, if there's something that they're more comfortable with, but traditionally the vote in the past has been that first it was the Board of Selectmen, but now it would be the Select Board is opposed to any development of the Mugar wetlands.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 159</summary>

> Mr. DeCorsi? Yeah, I'll second Mrs. Mahan's motion, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. And yeah, that's what we discussed last time and since my time on the board and going back before then. We have taken several votes to reaffirm our position from the initial letter that the Board of Selectmen wrote to Mass Housing on August 18, 2015, opposing the site. Mr. Hurd wrote a letter on behalf of the Select Board on July 7, 2020. Before that vote, we reaffirmed our position. We also had a detailed discussion on October 28, 2019, where we presented our position. We've been consistent, to my knowledge. We have been unanimous throughout this process in terms of our opposition to the proposed development there, all the while respecting the fact that there is a comprehensive permit in place now, and we covered that at the last meeting. But I support Mrs. Mahan's motion, and certainly support reaffirming our position on this.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 164</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. DeCorsi. Mr. Hurd? Yeah, I think we've allâ€”first of all, sorry for running in late, a lot of moving parts on Wednesdays. I don't want to go in-depth, things that we've said, you know, many times, but I'm happy to support the motion and just continue to join this board as we've done since I've been on the board. And for many years before that, to just say that it's not the right site for development of this kind is, you know, for years has been a great push, and I'd like to create more housing units, but it has to be placed correctly, or else just efforts in general to create more housing will stall if the housing that is created causes major issues in town, and that's what will likely happen at this site. So again, happy to continue to reassert the board's opposition to the project. Anything I would say has already been said, so I support it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 207</summary>

> Thank you, and the only thing I will say is that I welcome the opportunity, and the first time and opportunity I have as a member of this body, to take this vote and to reaffirm that. So, any further discussion? On a motion by Mrs. Mahan to reaffirm the select board's opposition to development of the Mugar property. And seconded by- Mugar Wetlands. Wetlands. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. No, Mugar Wetlands. We have the motion by Mrs. Mahan, and seconded by Mr. DeCorsi. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Opposed?  Opposed? It is unanimous, 5-0 vote. Thank you very much. I missed something important at the beginning. I want to welcome a new person at the table, and with my colleague's indulgence, Mr. Town Manager, perhaps you would like to introduce the individual to your left. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, a familiar face, but worth recognizing this evening, and that is Attorney Mike Cunningham, now serving in the position of Acting Town Counsel following the departure of Doug Himes. So please join me in welcoming Mike to the meeting. Welcome, Attorney Cunningham. Thank you for your commitment to the town. Thank you. I know you will serve us well. Thank you.

<details><summary>End of Year Budget Report</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 41</summary>

> Item three, we have end of the year budget report by Ida Cody, Comptroller. An important question I have, Ms. Cody, is are you of the school of Comptroller or Comptroller in pronunciation? Comptroller. And I stand corrected. Ida Cody, Comptroller.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ida Cody - 498</summary>

> Well, thank you for inviting me tonight to present and discuss the end of the year report, budget report. This is the report for the fiscal year 23, which ended on 6-30-2023. It's a little late, but we pushed it in hopes to get the free cash certified, and we did. This is my favorite report because it's packed, as you've probably seen, with good news and a good start for Jim. I hope you read it and enjoyed all the details. So I'm just going to cover the highlights. DOR has certified free cash, $8,032,011. This is an increase of $2.1 million over last year and the highest in history. For water sewer, we have certified retained earnings, $6,962,689. AYCC, $122,846. Council on Aging, $44,802. RINC, $82,042. And the rec department recreation, $1,342,423. I'm just going to briefly discuss the expenses and revenue on the general fund. On the expense side, we had a net increase in the undesignated fund balance of $3.3 million. And the appropriation turnbacks are a net of $3,704,704. The turnbacks are a combination of... They're actually mostly salaries because they were underspended because we had some vacancies and some retirements, and we didn't fill the positions immediately. We had one reserve transfer this year, and it was for a legal settlement. On the revenue, the general fund, we had a surplus of $6.2 million. This is a combination of conservative estimates and also a favorable economic environment. The main drivers for this $6 million are the building and wire permits. We exceeded the projection by $1.5 million. It's mostly because of the building at MIRAC. And also, we've seen increased requests for permits for solar panel and electrical car chargers. The motor vehicle excise exceeded the projection by $500,000. And this is probably mostly due to the increase of the cost of the cars. We had an increase in fees of a total of $560,000. This is a combination between the ambulance fees because we increased the rates in the ambulance and also the host community agreement. We didn't estimate any amounts on the balance sheet because we're not allowed to per DOR. Also, hotel, motel, and marijuana excise were up $560,000. And finally, the elephant, the interest income, which we've collected this year, $3 million. And we've discussed it a few times. We had a conservative estimate. But we also had a lot of cash in the bank from the constructions of high school and DPW. And the rates were really good. So that brought us an extra $3 million, which close to the free cash. The enterprise funds, not much to discuss here. We were on the nose projections versus actuals. And we certified healthy retained earnings across the board. You've also requested that we report the balances for several funds, the ARPA and the stabilization funds. And they're included in the report. I think this item would be of the most interest to you, if you have any questions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 20</summary>

> Thank you, Ms. Cody. I will now turn to the board for any remarks, questions. I'll go after Ms. Slott.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 415</summary>

> First, I'd like to move receipt. And thank Ms. Cody and everyone else behind you, literally and figuratively. I know there's a lot of work that goes into this. It was one of the things when I first got on the board, and it didn't happen for more than a decade. But to get quarterly reports and end-of-the-year reports is so beneficial. And it's not just something on a piece of paper or on the iPad. It's something that we all watch, look for trends, things like that. I also want to thank that I see with some of the categories, when we looked at expenses and revenues, and they were perhaps out of range of projections, I had asked about with investments with fire services, if perhaps, I was always told a good budget gets you as close to, because I'd say, oh, 237% more, that's great. And then someone said, well, that's good as an anomaly, but not every year. And I do see reflected in here that adjustments have been made concerning fire medical services, because the Mass General Law has changed and has increased those fines. And as far as the investment part of it, people tell me not to put myself down, but I will leave it to the investment minds in terms of, and I know we deal with standard employers or whomever gets chosen every year, but I don't expect to see that reflected in here, but going forward. And one of the things that I'm really happy about that this report allows us to do is, it's so great after COVID to see under Joe Conley and everyone who works over at the Arlington Recreation Department, how well they're doing, not only in terms of the revenue generated, but if you look behind the revenue generated number at the programs that have come back, as well as are brand new, that really highlight the Arlington Recreation Department and its properties in so many different ways. So I definitely appreciate that. And then I just had one sort of technical question, and it may be because it's a school question, you get back to me with the answer. But I know somewhere in here, I didn't highlight it, but it had to do with special ed budgeting collections, and I believe, I don't know if it's the town or the schools that hired a consultant like PCG. Can you give me like four or five sentences on that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ida Cody - 183</summary>

> It looks like it's successful and a good thing to do, if you could verify. So the federal government reimburses us for special ed services. Our school department enters in all the data, all the kids they're servicing, and then this consultant gathers all the data, puts the report together, and submits it, and we get the reimbursement. Sometimes there's a timing issue. When you deal with the state and government, there's always a delay in getting our money back. But, yeah, this is how it works. They look at the reports they gather, the nurses enter, and whatever stuff that's designated to the special ed education, they enter in the data, gets collected, filtered by the consultant, and submitted for reimbursement. And, again, I say that is a positive thing. Having gone through that world myself, that was always the three numbers in special educations. We're so nebulous, and I think sometimes it affects programs if you don't know what it is and how to plan and finance. So that's something that I was really happy to see, and that it's working.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 25</summary>

> Thank you. That one's hard to predict because we don't know how much of the expenses they will accept and reimburse. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 284</summary>

> Thank you. Mr. Dickens. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We have some time, so I'll just ask a bunch of minor curiosity questions and give me really short answers. So the clerk was over by 1%, 2K. I know it's a lot of money, but the clerk expenditures were up. They were over by 2K, 1%. So if you look at the clerk, we voted it together with town clerk election and registers. They are voted as a bottom line. So although the clerk is a 101%, the election is 95% only. Okay. And the registers is 96. So bottom line, they're still within the appropriation. Yeah, I was just wondering if there was something, maybe over time, something going on. I keep an eye on them. Just minor. So the council on aging was also up by 21K, 6%. The same thing. The council on aging gets voted with the Board of Health. I got you. So they can overspend in one if they underspend in the other. Okay, got you. So Airbnb, it brought in 10K. Like how many units were that? I don't get that data. Okay, all right. I was just wondering how much Airbnb business was going on. And whether we had a sense of whether we're capturing all of it or not. Do you have a sense of that? I just get whatever the state sends me, no backup for it. Yeah, just a second. I think that might be in the scope of a different employee. Maybe a question would be good for the town manager to handle just for a more complete answer. You know, about sort of the policy and the procedures of that program.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ida Cody - 117</summary>

> Sure. Thank you. I can't say that I think any of us will be able to accurately predict how much of the revenue we're capturing. I would say it's likely not all of it because I know that sometimes returning guests don't go through the Airbnb platform. And I would assume that we do still have some units out there that are doing short-term rentals in an unregistered fashion. But I do believe, and I'm not sure if we have the information available, that we could at least notify the board of how many short-term rental units we do have through our own local permitting process that may be generating some of this revenue. Thank you, sir.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 104</summary>

> No, I appreciate that. And also, as I said, these really are just kind of curiosity questions. I never know what I'm going to do with it. And since we have the time, I'm doing it. So this is one where I just don't understand. And so a lot of times I will ask questions, put people on the spot, and I say the reason is I just didn't have time to call beforehand. But at the end of, I forget which paragraph, there's a sentence, the balance of $1.5 million was closed to free cash. What does that mean? Where are you looking?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins and Idy Cody - 326</summary>

> Okay, let me help find it. It's just ignorance on my part. So I think you're talking about the collective bargaining. So what happens, let's say we, oh, or is it the reserve fund? So it's on page one, on the other. Oh, the reserve fund. OK. So we appropriate $1.5 million in the reserve fund just in case some departments run out of money and we need to transfer it. If we don't transfer it, everything turns into free cash. It's a turn back. And it goes towards the calculation of free cash, meaning we raise the money, but we didn't need them. Because we didn't have any emergencies, like the legal settlement. So if we don't use it, usually we come here for snow and ice, but DPW had enough money to cover the snow and ice. So it's just usually for emergencies. So then close to free cash means it stays in free cash or it goes to the general fund? It's general fund. It stays with the general fund, yes. I just think it's just ignorance on my part, and I had a chance to ask. So earnings on investments, so it says that some of it was due to higher interest rates, means that we got a higher return, well, quite a bit higher return. Are you anticipating that costing us more in borrowing this upcoming year? We don't know where the rates are going to go. I enjoyed them, even in my personal bank account. But definitely the balance has gone down. We had a large amount of cash to build the high school and DPW. We started the year with $100 million, and we ended with like $50 million. This money collect interest in the bank. So that's why. So the interest rates were high. Some of the banks, MMDT, had 5%. So that adds up. But now we're not going to have so much cash on the books.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 31</summary>

> Yeah, right, right. Because we've been building. And that's in terms of what we're getting from savings. But my question is, are we anticipating an increase in the cost of borrowing?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ida Cody - 19</summary>

> Mr. Jiggins, I think that that's a broader question maybe that the town manager would like to speak to.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 56</summary>

> Sure, Len. Without getting into specific percentage basis points, I think to answer your question, we are making more in interest than we would be in paying on our borrowings. So we're still getting, we're projecting to receive favorable rates when we go out next for a borrowing as compared to what we're receiving in interest.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 137</summary>

> But that's just, again, due to our strong bond rating and being a community who has an attractive issuance when we offer it. So I get that. It's just that there's been, I mean, some people weren't expecting rates to go up as much as they did. And they've gotten a little caught in that. And I'm not saying that we're in trouble or anything. I'm just asking if we're anticipating higher rates, maybe a little higher than we were expecting, which I know is a little contradictory to the word, anticipating. So that was the basis of the question. Yeah, I would agree. Like the next time we borrow, the rate will be higher than the last time we borrowed, for sure. So on Bluebikes, I mean, there's $100,000. I see there's no spending on that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 38</summary>

> Actually, the planning director is working on it. I don't know what is the holdup. I've touched base with her. And she said that she does have the project is on her table. But she hasn't started yet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 85</summary>

> All right, a little bit of a scrappy in town meeting on that one. So I was just curious. I mean, it's good that we got the money. I mean, I was just kind of wondering what's going on. And the last one, a little humorous. So I see that the revenue on cemeteries was a little low. Is that because fewer people? Maybe people are living a little longer?  Well, I mean, we charge, I believe, $2,000 for opening and $100 for foundation.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 43</summary>

> So I don't know. I guess it depends on how many customers we have. I think Ms. Cody is an outstanding accountant. But the expertise for that probably falls on the Cemetery Commission. Right, right. So I'm hoping that we have less reason.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 214</summary>

> So thank you. That's it, thanks. Thank you, Mr. Diggins. I think it's safe to say that you always keep us on our toes. Mr. DiCorsi. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ms. Cody, for the report. The quarterly reports are very informative. The year-end report is especially so, because we can see the results of what's happened throughout the year, what's being turned back, where we met expectations. And here, it's all good news in terms of where expenses came in and where we came in on our revenue estimates. And I would say to Mr. Diggins' question on the Reserve Fund, the Reserve Fund is there for unforeseen circumstances. The fact that we didn't have to tap into that much is actually good news. There weren't unforeseen events during the year that required those funds. So I wanted to thank you. I had a couple of questions. Just one of them was related to what Mr. Diggins said on, just in Warren articles in general, in Warren articles, once they're voted, if you can just clarify this, by town meeting, that money is set aside until the warrants, whatever purpose the funds are spent, unless there's a vote, a subsequent vote to return the funds. Is that my right on that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ida Cody or Jim Feeney - 86</summary>

> So usually, the regular appropriation general fund, they're one year. If you don't spend it by the end of the fiscal year, you didn't encumber it, you lose it. With the articles, we give you two years to spend it. So I always check on them. I see when was the last appropriation. I trace the money, and then I touch base with them. If the departments don't have encumbrances or invoices for it, then I'll just take it away and close it to free cash.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 42</summary>

> OK, great. Thank you very much, and thank you to Mr. McGee as well. I know he did work with you on the report and as the finance director and deputy town manager. So thank you very much. Yep. Thank you, sir.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 183</summary>

> Mr. Hart? Thank you for the presentation. I always, I think I say this every time, but I enjoy these. It's good to get an update on, you know, we deal with so many issues in town. But luckily, I'm able to rely on the finance gurus who run the town financing. So it's never been an area that I immerse myself in. But just to see the top sheet and to see how well our town is run by the people that are responsible for the finances is really impressive every time we get to see this, especially as we go through, you know, we have an upcoming vote to add money to the overrides stabilization fund. And it shows we can go to the town. Some of the townspeople who say, you know, manage your money better and say, look, you know, we're under budget. We're very well run compared to other cities and towns. And this report kind of gives us the fuel to hit back against that. So again, very impressive. No questions. And thank you for the report.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 58</summary>

> Thank you, sir. I will add my appreciation to that. Every time that we do this, I'm amazed how much our team understands this really complex and diverse budget, and particularly Ms. Cody is the guardian of a lot of this. I sleep better at night knowing that your eyes are on this at all times. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 91</summary>

> And I should second that, Mr. Chair. I should second the receipt of the report. Oh, thank you. I was going to say, hurry up. We did not have one. Help a girl out. That's right. All right, so to that end, we have a motion to receive from Mrs. Mahana, seconded by Mr. Diggins, was sort of a bookends of a motion to second here. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is a unanimous 5-0 vote. Thank you again. Thank you. Have a good evening. Thank you.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Health and Human Services Update</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 82</summary>

> And following the string of our outstanding town employees and leaders, we have a health and human services update from Christine Bongiorno, deputy town manager. If you'd like to come up and face the music. And by way of explanation, I think most people know, but for the public's information, until very recently, Ms. Bongiorno was the department head for health and human services. So this made the most sense to give us an update on whatever we think we should know.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Bongiorno - 492</summary>

> Great, thank you. I don't know, Steve, if you wanted to give context to the update?  Yeah, do you want me to start? It's up to you. No, why don't you go ahead. I'll add some comments. Sure, sure. So there were conversations that were happening earlier in this year just around AEDs, which are basically used when somebody has a medical event in a building, in a public place. And those are the boxes that are placed in various locations, entrances of buildings. And what we were noticing in town was that not every town building had one. And where they were placed was different in every location. Who was in charge of the upkeep was, a lot of people were unsure. So what we did was we looked at developing a systematic program across all the buildings in partnership between the health department and the fire department. What we did was we had our teams go out and do an assessment, a basic assessment of what we have, where they're located, what the device model number is, the battery, how often they have to be changed, and really who's responsible in each location. So we did a basic assessment. We determined locations that didn't have AEDs. And we developed a plan to, over the course of the next several years, basically install new ones in locations that didn't have them. And then in locations where they may not be visible, we're planning to move them. Town Hall is a great example of that. The current AED is located right outside the elevator. It may not be as visible or as obvious to people. So the plan will be to move that to a more visible location, while also providing training to building occupants so that they know where the AED is and how to use it. Basically, they may be located on the wall. And people in various offices may not know where it is or even what to do or when to use it. So the plan will be to take the training to building occupants, so starting in Town Hall and then moving out to the other buildings. In addition to the AEDs, we also found that there are these SAM boxes, S-A-M. And these are boxes where they're being placed in various public locations all across the state. They contain Narcan, which is used in the event of an overdose. And so our goal is to have those in some of our more public locations, such as the library, the ice skating rink, as well as Town Hall, and most likely the Department of Public Works because of its location to some sensitive areas, including the park across the street. So we have this plan between the Health Department and Fire Department. And we will be starting to install and move these devices and also provide training to building occupants, likely within the next six months.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 370</summary>

> Thank you very much. Mr. Christie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Bongiorno. I'll provide a little context now on the AEDs. And I want to thank Ms. Bongiorno. First, congratulate you, again, on your promotion to Deputy Town Manager. But we've had discussions since the spring. And this resulted from an experience I had in March. I was at Boston City Hall. And a person behind me, going through security, collapsed. And luckily, there was a defibrillator that was in the lobby. And the security personnel at City Hall had been trained on the emergency medical intervention. And not only did the person who took over starting CPR and actually using the defibrillator is absolutely amazing. But just keeping everybody else calm, because she knew exactly what to do, that calmed everybody else down, but also saved this man's life. There's no question about it. And until the EMTs arrived, and it really looking back as March 7th, a really emotional day when I think about it now. But a remarkable, remarkable act by the employees and the whole team. They were recognized by Mayor Wu after that happened. As a result of that, and seeing that Ms. Bongiorno and I have been talking throughout the spring and summer about, one, making sure that employees know where the AEDs are. Because that was one issue at first. Finding it. But two, knowing what to do in the first minutes of a medical emergency. And that's what I think this training will happen going forward. So critical until the fire department or the EMTs can arrive. Those first few minutes are critical. And I saw it. And the person is alive and doing well that that happened that day because of that experience and the calmness and just having that equipment nearby and available. So thank you for bringing this along. And I encourage people who work for the town, people in the community. The hospitals have that type of training in addition to what the town's doing. It's so important. Because you never know if you're going to be there. And thank God this person was there that day because it was a dire situation. So thank you.

> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Corsi. Mr. Feeney. Yes, thank you, Christina. I just wanted to be opportunistic and add while we're on the topic of AEDs that Recreation Director Joe Connolly recently shared with me that following the rollout of the outdoor AEDs that we had installed at Thorndike Field and Hills Hill, there has been significant interest in rolling out and expanding that program in the community. And the resident who started that program has already made an additional significant donation to the town. And we're already looking at purchasing three more climate-controlled units for, I believe they're going to be designated for McClennan Field, Heard Field, and probably over at the Spy Pond Tennis Courts. So again, great public interest in these devices and what they can do in the event of emergency. And we're looking not only to expand them in our buildings, but also in our athletic facilities. So thank you for letting me share that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 121</summary>

> Yeah, no, thank you. Mrs. Monn. And just a quick question. If we don't have an answer tonight, that's fine. But are all the AEDs pretty much universal in the sense that I know for the sports groups that we belong to, we go through BLS, ALS, AED every two years. And the ones that we're trained on, and if you know, I'm assuming that there's just one type of AED. And the ones that we're trained on in class is first you're trained on how to apply it. And then the AED first tells you if this is an appropriate situation to continue to step two to apply the device. And I was just wondering, are all AEDs like that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Bongiorno - 111</summary>

> The ones that are in public locations are. They're made by different companies. So they may have different pads, or they may look a little different. But for the most part, they're all similar to what you were trained on, the ones in public locations. The ones that are used by fire and police are the professional versions that are used also by hospitals. And so they're obviously different. But the ones that are in public locations will be doing the universal training. And they're generally the same. And so it's a verbal clearance, voice clearance versus if you were on EMS with an ALS. They just look at the readout.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 110</summary>

> OK, I was just thinking of that when Mr. DeCourcy was raising that, and I was thinking when we get trained. And I'm like, is it just the ones we're getting trained on? But they all do that. And I encourage anyone, definitely all my children, two of my three children, once they became parents, with the exception of my daughter Rebecca, because she's a coach, but my son-in-law, daughter-in-law, and son-in-law got CPR training right away, which is different for infants and then for children, and AEDs included, even though I have no AEDs in my home. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. DeCourcy. Thank you, Ms. Magerno. Mr. Hurd.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 424</summary>

> Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. I think I know the answer to the question. But so of the AED boxes that are either in, say, in this building or at the rink, are they open? Like, it doesn't require a special key or anything so anyone can get into the box?  Correct. I know you mentioned there was training at hospital. Would the town, has the town ever considered sponsoring training locally?  Because I coach every day of my life, and I've never been trained. I've done training to run drills for hockey, but I've never been trained with AEDs. And a lot of the training we do now is remote anyways. So it's certainly something, as a coach at a baseball field, like, this discussion opens, and it's almost scary to me as someone saying, well, you know, I don't know if it's the appropriate time. Like, how am I going to go and use these things to revive somebody? I'm not a medical professional. So I assume they are somewhat user friendly once you have the training. But I mean, it would be interesting at least publicizing, you know, when the training's available and when people can do it. And if there was, you know, a couple of times a year that we could do it at town hall or somewhere, where we bring people in and keep it open to the public, I think that would be really beneficial. We had talked about doing the building occupants, so the town staff, and then taking that a step further and offering it to committees, so people that are in our buildings at night, and then also to the sports community. I think we had discussed that, and that could be another phase within our program. And I think where you could put it back on, I went to baseball, to say, just so you guys know, now there's AEDs at these fields. So as part of your training, you take all your coaches, and I went to baseball, I can pay for the training. But just to make sure that all those programs know that they're there, and you could say, you know, put the onus on them to have the coaches train. I just, like I said, I mean, I've, every day I'm somewhere, and I wouldn't know the first thing to do if I even opened up that box. So I'd be interested in getting trained myself, and making sure others are around the boxes, and so. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 343</summary>

> Well, I guess we were on the same wavelength. I guess for me, it was learning about that, with the T, when the guy was killed, with his hand stuck in the door, meaning that someone had pulled an emergency stop, they could have been presented that, you know. And so you probably weren't here in the meeting when I kind of brought up the whole AED thing. So I'm glad that we have multiple people thinking about this. And beyond the AED training is also just first aid training. And a large component of that is just having someone who is kind of taking charge of the situation and making sure, you know, that 911 is called. Because there are more than just, I mean, heart events, I mean, there's choking, which is a big one. And so I wouldn't ask the town to take responsibility for that. But as we tell people to get trained for AEDs, it's like, if you have it in you to even get first aid training, you know, it's really helpful and useful. So thank you for doing this. Thank you for doing this, you know, and yeah. Thank you very much. Just a further question, and this is in the Department of Fun Facts about your select board chair. I'm sorry to remind you that back in the day, more decades ago than I care to think, I was actually a Red Cross CPR instructor, and in fact, an instructor of instructors. But that was long before AEDs were available to the public. And since then, boy, the CPR technique for the public has changed considerably. But that really comes to the point of, with these devices particularly, if someone, a member of the public, were to find themselves in a situation where someone has no pulse and is not breathing and the AED is available, but they have not had training, can they do harm with those devices? Would you recommend that they, you know, use them or not use them in that circumstance?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 329</summary>

> Well, the first step is to call 911. Of course. And then when you open the box, it walks you through the steps, as Diane Mahan had mentioned. It'll tell you to peel off the pads, put them on the body, and it'll tell you if it needs, you know, it'll read the heart rhythm and it'll determine whether or not the shock will be given and if it's needed or not. But while that's happening, we hope that the ambulance is on its way. You know, you should have called the ambulance at that point. But yeah, there's, you know, it'll walk you through very simply what to do. Yeah. That's helpful to know. So, I mean, if I got this right, my takeaway being that, you know, call 911 first. And that it's certainly preferable to have the training because you'll be more confident, but that the devices are designed to prevent you from hurting somebody if you follow the instructions. I think it's an important message to have out there for the public so that people don't hesitate to offer aid, you know, if they're in that situation. Yeah, I'm sorry, and just coming back, but I don't think that can be repeated enough. That day, the person who actually used the ED and performed the CPI, the first thing she did, she said, okay, somebody call 911. And a person was identified, two people called, but one got through, and then she went to work. So, critical, call 911 first. Yeah. And it's a situation where, I think, a lot of people will assume somebody else did, you know, so exactly, just to be, point to somebody, you know. So, we've all had our turn at public health education now, and helping out a little bit, not that you need it. But I want to thank both you, Ms. Barger and Mr. DeCourcy, for your leadership and awareness in building the town's capacity for this.

<details><summary>Consent Agenda</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 144</summary>

> Great. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Moving on to our consent agenda. We have items 5, 6, and 7, a request for a special one-day BRM1 license on October 29th at Buckfield for a fundraiser by Kelly Grealish, request for a permit for a Veterans Day parade Saturday, November 11th, excuse me, from the Department of Health and Human Services, request for a contractor drain layer license, Galway Excavation, LLC, by Anthony Kerwin. Pardon me, I'll turn to the board for discussion and motions. So, motion to approve consent agenda, you know. Second. All right. I can get you some water if you want. Do you want to get some water? Yes. I'm sorry. A couple of us could use a glass of water suddenly. Yeah. Thank you very much. I don't know what it is. Sorry, I have dry air. Mrs. Mahoney.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 278</summary>

> I just wanted to highlight the event down at Buckfield for the Dan Kelly Foundation, Arlington resident police officer. The foundation has been set up in his memory on the 29th. His wife, Kelly Grealish, Kelly, and others have really done a lot of work on this and put it together. But again, I want to highlight Joe Conley, who really has been working with the family and with the event to really expand it. And there will be a beer, not garden, beer truck there, getting all the approvals for that. And it's mostly a family event for the free skate, but then there'll also be a large screen TV because it will be a Patriots game or a football game if anybody wants to stay outside and watch that. So anyone who can make it coming down on October 29th, I believe the skate starts at, I think it's one to five. And of course, any members of the board that can make it down there. There'll be other things. I don't want to call it a photo booth because it's really a lot more than that. It's Chuck Coughlin, who works for several of the news stations and for the Patriots down at Gillette. So it's more advanced. I say photo booth. So it's going to be a great event. And anyone who can make it down for a great guy who I miss terribly every day, along with so many other people. But people have told me, as long as you keep remembering people and talking about them, then they're still there with you, but just in a different way. So that's October 29.

<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 72</summary>

> All right. We have appointments on Item 8, the Arlington Committee on Tourism and Economic Development. And the Nicole Gustos?  Hello. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you very much for your willingness to serve. If you'd like to just say a few words. Thank you very much for your willingness to serve. If you'd like to just briefly tell the board what your interest is and what you're looking forward to.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nicole Gustas - 176</summary>

> Sure. I'm happy to discuss. I have over 10 years of experience in tourism. And I am experienced at working with every iteration of tourism from the small local level and laddering up to the national level. And I also understand how we can plug into those larger organizations in order to promote what Arlington has to offer. In addition to that, I am just enthusiastic about everything that they're doing. I'd like to help out with all of the things that relate to tourism and history in our region because I'm a huge history buff. And I also studied history in college and worked as a historical documentarian for several years. I think that Arlington has a lot to offer and I recognize currently we only have one hotel and a limited number of other things. But I would like to see us leverage that and then see what we can do to build off of that in order to bring people into the community and have them spend their dollars in our great businesses.

> Thank you very much indeed. I will now turn to my colleagues for motions and comments. Mr. Hurd.

<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 276</summary>

> Thank you. And thank you for your willingness to serve. I've been the representative to ATED for a few years and we've been on a recruiting kick and it's not always the committee that people jump up to serve on. But it really does serve a really important function, especially I know I'm sure you've had conversations with Angela about the 250 celebration that's coming up in the next few years that we're working towards. And your experience really drops right into what we're working on for that celebration to try to tap into national networks to get a little prominence for the town of Arlington, formerly Mononomy, during that celebration time because there will be a great influx of tourists at that time. And this committee also in recent years has, in the wake of COVID, really put a lot of efforts towards economic development piece of it, trying to work with businesses and come up with creative ways to support our local businesses, sometimes in town, the interest of local businesses, take a back seat to some other agendas. But it's good to have at least one committee that's really working to make sure that we can support those people that come into Arlington to start businesses. And we transitioned the committee about a year ago to try to put that front and center and to fuse the two ideas of tourism and business development together. So it is a great committee. It's a great group of individuals that you'll get to know very well and run very well by Angela. So thank you for your willingness to serve and happy to move approval.

To our appointee, if you get us some tourists from Australia, you'd get another term, okay? So I'm impressed with your connection to Australia.

Any further discussion? Excellent. Thank you again for your willingness to serve. You bring an outstanding background, and I look forward to your contributions. On a motion to appoint by Mr. Hurd and seconded by Mr. Diggins, all in favor, please say yes. Yes. Oh, wow. I meant to say aye, but you just followed right along. That works. All opposed?

<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 131</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just one article for the board's consideration as part of the report. This is an article that was discussed and voted upon by the board in its September 27th meeting. It's noted that Mr. DeCourcy recused himself from the discussion and vote on this article. I believe that it accurately reflects the changes that the board requested at that hearing. I believe that the terms of the article are correct and the comments were changed in accordance with some of those that were requested. As a reminder, this is the prohibition on new fossil fuel infrastructure and new construction and major renovation that was set forth at the meeting last September 27th by our sustainability manager, Talia Fox, and also sponsored by the Clean Energy Futures Committee.

I did do a control F on that. I'll second. Just kidding, Attorney Heim. We have a second from Mrs. Bahama. I want to thank acting town council for contained in the comments is for the fossil fuel. Special warrant article is the tie-in. I don't know if maybe you can give two or three sentences. I know I've spoken to people out in the public regarding some who it seems like the special town meeting warrant article on fossil fuels, I haven't found anybody that person in the street that hasn't been supportive of it. There is sort of a tie-in or a partnership with the MBTA communities act. I'm thankful that you do have it in the comments. Perhaps if you could speak two to four sentences on that in terms of what the heck is Mahan talking about? This is the fossil fuel. Why is she bringing up MBTA communities,
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 129</summary>

> if I may, Mr. Chair? Absolutely, Mrs. Mahan. Thank you, Mr. Chair. When the town passed its clean heat bylaw back in 2020, the state said you can't do that. We're going to do it as part of a state program. The state passed legislation and invited a very small group of communities, in fact, only ten. Arlington was first to get in to participate in the fossil fuel demonstration project. As part of the requirement to participate in that project, the town or community has to pass an MBTA communities bylaw prior to a certain time. That's why the two are tied together. A failure to pass an MBTA communities bylaw by the special town meeting would preclude us from this program. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 128</summary>

> Thank you, Mrs. Mahan. Any further discussion? I'll just add for myself that we expressed our views, I think, when Ms. Fox came to present this to us at our last meeting. I'm really happy. I think this is a really good summary of the discussion. I was tempted to suggest strongly recommend, but I think I'll just keep my powder dry. I know that there's a strong sentiment on the board in support of this program and support of the values that it represents for the towns and its priorities. We have a motion to approve the final vote and comments by Mr. Hurd and seconded by Mr. and Mrs. Mahan. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed?  Unanimous 5-0 vote. Thank you very much.

<details><summary>Update: Overnight Parking Pilot</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 12</summary>

> Okay. Now we have an overnight parking pilot update by Mr. Diggins.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 478</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Did you all get the PDF that I sent? It's okay. If Ms. Mahan, I mean, Ms. Maher wants to pull it up, that's fine, but I don't think we'll need to. This is just very preliminary, as you can see. It's kind of evenly split between East Arlington and, well, Arlington Heights or non-East Arlington. I kind of drew the line at Pleasant Street, Messick Street, so Precincts 1 through 7 is East Arlington, 8 through 21 is non-East Arlington. And Precinct 3 tends to perform a lot. It does this time. It has nine of the slots. I say that because Precinct 3 is also having three precinct meetings this fall. So, yeah, I mean, there's a little clustering. Nine, three, four, and five, I mean, I think probably have the top, yeah. They have nine, seven, and eight, respectively, in terms of permits. So we see a little clustering in those precincts. But as I said, overall, I mean, they're pretty evenly split across town. Precincts 9 and 15 have none. Actually, 9, 11, and 15 have none. Actually, 9, 11, 15, 18, and 19 have none. But, you know, it's only 60 out there. So that's where we are. I talked with Chief. And as you all know, we're not really seeing any emails. She asked for a quick little comparison of complaints before and after the pilot. Not seeing any difference, meaning not seeing anything really relating to the pilot itself. So that's just preliminary. So what I will ask you all to do is think about what questions you would like answered when we do the final analysis. Because the goal is to do that analysis pretty quickly. Mainly because it's like you wait and things come up. As soon as this thing is over, it's like, let's have the questions ready to go and try and get those questions answered as quickly as possible. So if the chair will permit it, maybe in December I'll ask to see if people have questions. Essentially, I'd like to see if there has been any complaints that are directly related to the pilot. People, of course, are going to have their philosophical positions about it. I don't really expect those to change. But we really want to see are there any complaints or any issues that came up as a direct result of the pilot. So that's it. That's another way to let people know it is going. Another two months. You can sign up. It seems like one person signed up as late as... the fifth, you know, so take advantage of it if you can, if you want. So that's it. Any questions? Thank you. Any discussion or questions from the board? Good. Thank you for your work on this, Mr. Diggins. This is useful information. You're welcome.

<details><summary>Transportation Advisory Committee Downing Square Memo</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 45</summary>

> All right. We now go to item 11, the Transportation Advisory Committee Downing Square Memo. And Ms. Marr, if you would promote Jeff Maxtuz to the panel. He's come over from the TAC meeting and is available, but I'll let Mr. Diggins carry this one.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 185</summary>

> Thank you. I'm just trying to pull up that memo. All right. So it's pretty straightforward. I take it you all have seen it and read it. So essentially it's really adding more information to the signs. And we have two choices, whether we put those additions on all six signs or we put them on three of them, and the three are the ones that have the most traffic. TAC recommends all six. I don't think the cost would be prohibitive in doing three more signs. And so I asked Mr. Maxtuz if he could be here because if there were any historical questions based on what's happened there, historically he's been around for a long time and he could answer those questions about maybe other work TAC has done on that intersection and why we think signs are the better way to go as opposed to trying to do a signal there. So with that, I'll ask Mr. Maxtuz if he wants to add anything. Sure. Mr. Maxtuz, thank you. Well, thank you for joining us, sir. I'm sorry, through you. Understood, yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jeff Maxtuz - 200</summary>

> Thank you, Len, Chairman, members of the board. Yeah, the only thing I'll add is these are advisory plaques, so they would go on, you know, the existing stop signs. So they go on the five approaches that have the stop signs, every approach except Park Ave, northbound, which does not have stop control. So these are MUTC compliant. They're not regulatory signs. They're just advisory information signs. And, you know, we were trying to come up with a method that would give motorists more information at a confusing intersection, but wouldn't create more confusion at the intersection. You can see similar signs at Dow Avenue and the frontage road where it goes under Route 2 there, where there's advisory signs that say, you know, cross traffic does not stop. And there's a similar kind of placard. So, yeah, so there's kind of precedent for these signs. And we think, you know, obviously, if you know this intersection, it is confusing, particularly if people don't know it. So we think it would add some benefit to try to make it clear, which is kind of an unconventional, you know, five-way stop sign at a six-lane intersection. Thank you very much.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 134</summary>

> And thanks, Jeff, for clarifying and correcting me, you know, in a gentle way. So it is five signs versus three, you know, so they recommend the five. Is that a motion? Or you want to discuss it? I just wanted to ask if I could, either through the chair to Mr. Diggins or to our Transportation Advisory Committee member, Mr. Max Tutis. I understand there's the preferred option, which is the five-sign option. And then there's an alternative option of three signs, which I was sort of leaning towards that. So I guess I would ask, but I'm fine. My question is, how preferred is the preferred option? Or is it really a 50-50? Or, I mean, I want to go with what TAC is there. You know what I'm trying to ask?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jeff Maxtuz - 136</summary>

> Yeah, I think one might be, you know, right, what is the strength of that preference? And maybe you could provide some rationale for the recommendation. So I think the only, and TAC preferred the full, you know, five signs. The only question that came up about sign clutter, you know, we don't want to kind of over-sign it. And if we're going to provide two legs that were kind of lower volume, it'd be Westminster for sure. And then Bow, it's somewhat less volume, but it still has moderate volume. So the TAC preference is to put all five signs, but there was an option if people saw that there may be too many signs or clutter, you could back off to three signs. But I think our preference at this point is five signs.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 21</summary>

> Okay. Was that a motion? It wasn't a motion, but I will say, I understand where you're coming from, Ms. Mahon.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 369</summary>

> I mean, I was kind of like interested almost in the experiment of it, meaning like put up three and then add two. But generally, I mean, I understand the recommendation. And also, I'm thinking while we're at it, we might as well just do it all, you know. And because if it were a significant cost, I would say, okay, we'll hold off and add the other two later on. But if we get DPW all set to put up the signs, just go ahead and put up all five, you know, so a little more efficient. Yeah, I'll just add that these plaques, there's no more, there's not going to be any new posts, right? So they just go on the same post that the stop sign. So it's just a plaque, you know, underneath the stop sign. Yeah, I should be more accurate in the way I say things. So, right, plaques. And just sort of a process question, if I may. If you're not from Arlington, I mean, everyone who's been in Arlington for a few number of years gets to Downing Square, can name off the five streets. But if you're not from Arlington, and I'm not looking for more signs, but I'm blanking right now trying to pull it up as a visual in my head. If you're from out of town, and you're coming up Lowell Street, and you see a sign that says, Park Ave does not stop, Park Ave extension. Is there signage there? So people, if they hit that five thing, that they'll know what streets are being talked about, that does stop and does not stop? Do we have street signs there? Because I don't think we do on all five. We do on Bow. We sometimes on Westminster. But why don't we just leave that, and I'll leave it, if I could, Mr. Chair, through you to the town manager, you know, perhaps to ask DPW or someone just to take a peek at that. And they may be, I think with all the construction and stuff we've lost in the detours, we've lost a few, but maybe not. So no need to answer that right now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 227</summary>

> Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair. All right. Still waiting for a motion. I'd like to move approval of the preferred option of the five signs. I think you just got scooped, Mr. Hurd. I'm happy to second it. Thank you, Mr. Mohon. Yeah. I mean, I prefer the five options too. I mean, I understand sign clutter, but they're all on different roads facing away from the intersection. I think if we're going to do it, we might as well provide the information to everyone. I'm having deja vu from about eight years ago. I think when I was on tech with Mr. McIntosh, we were trying to come up with signs for this intersection. I think initially we were trying to see if there was a graphic, some sort of an illustration that would come up with it. And I think at the time someone had suggested just the lettering that just kind of explained where the through traffic comes from. But I think on many occasions, this intersection has been referred to as controlled chaos because it's a little crazy, but there's very little crash incidents at the intersection. But that being said, it's still, it's confusing for a lot of people coming through. So I, you know, I think this is a good idea and I would be happy to support it. Mr. DiCorsi.

> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank you, Mr. Max, taking time from the tech meeting tonight to join us. I support the five signs as well. I'm familiar with a similar setup in Belmont at the end of Bright Road, Washington Street, and the end of Blanchard Road and works very well. In that case, it's only three streets, two out of three have the signage there. And I think, as Mr. Hertz said, it's controlled chaos. It seems to work, but I think this will only help make it safer. So thank you. Thank you. I think with respect to Belmont's three stop sign intersection, Arlington basically says, hold my beer. We got five. Mr. Hertz. One other question, and this doesn't need an answer, I guess now, but just thinking of other intersections, and I know this is sort of the way it sets up reminds me of Appleton Street, as you go towards where there's Appleton and Dow all comes in together. We've had a lot of correspondence about making that safer, and there's only so much we could do just because of the sheer size of the intersection. But wondering if this would be something to think about for that intersection as well, where it's just one street can drive right into the intersection and the others can't, and to let people know if the DPW is creating one set of signs, maybe we look into them creating two sets of signs if it's easy enough. But I'm not putting that into the vote. I'm just kind of throwing that out for food for thought.

> Thank you. If I'm not mistaken, I think that intersection that Mr. Hurd mentioned is currently in the tank for TACC to look at. There's a referral to that. So my request I might make is, in general, because we do hear about that with some regularity on other things, that we welcome updates from TACC in general about projects, even if the news is in progress, so we could communicate to people. But that's a good point, and I think that idea of of streamlining and integration is always good to look for those opportunities, those efficiencies. But we very much appreciate the work, and I was very happy to get this myself. I think we heard, I think, soon after I was elected, I heard from a constituent with, actually, I don't think we ended up sending it to TACC, but saying, you know, could we please put some signs here? So I'm just going to pretend that I made that happen, and we'll be very happy. Mr. Diggins?

> Two things. One is, I don't see a stop sign, I mean, a street sign for park at that intersection on Google Street View three years ago, and I doubt anything has changed. And other is, just to me, I understand why we don't have a light there, but as a pedestrian, I mean, it's just a scary intersection, especially when cars keep going, you know, like which way are they going to turn? And also along the lines of the timing on this, I mean, and this is something that I'll take responsibility for as a member of TACC, but this had actually come, this recommendation had been made a while ago, and it just got hung up, you know, and like I said, I'll take ownership for that, but this could have been before us, I mean, as early as June, you know, or actually as early as May, you know, they kind of came just as I was leaving, you know, my role as chair, and we were going to the town meeting, you know, and so now it's like, I'm going to take ownership of it, which means that I can now solve it, so that I'll just make sure that anything that comes out of TACC, I mean, I'll make sure that it gets placed before, you know, the chair meeting as soon as possible, so any delay, you know, wasn't on the part of TACC. It took a while to study this, you know, but TACC was on the ball, and so here we are. Thank you.

> I appreciate that very much. I know we all do. Okay, so we have a motion to adopt the TACC's recommended preferred solution by Mrs. Mahan, seconded by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Is there a unanimous vote? Thank you very much, Jeff, and tell TACC we said hi, and that we appreciate their work, and that I missed them, and that Mr. Diggins misses them terribly. I will let them know. Thank you. Good night.

<details><summary>Request for 'No Parking This Side' Signs to Extend on Wildwood Avenue</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 194</summary>

> All right. Wow, we are already at correspondence received. Don't change it. Yeah, exactly. We have item 12, request for no parking this side signs to extend on Wildwood Avenue from Amy Duke at 33 Newman Way, and a memo advising the board and the public about the Civilian Police Advisory Commission appointments. So I'll turn to the board for any motions to receive. Motion to receive and direct meeting number 12 to the town manager. That's it. Thank you, sir. Second. All right, any further discussion? Okay, and a motion to receive both items and to refer item 12 to the town manager by Mr. Diggins, seconded by Mr. DeCorsi. Item 13, you mean? I'm sorry? You mean item 13? I do, yes. Thank you. So all in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Unanimous vote. I'm sorry, what just happened to 13? We received both of them. Okay, yeah. Receive both and then refer item 12. Right, that's what I thought. Is that your understanding, Attorney Cunningham? Yes. The guardian of our legal record here. Thank you. Correct, correct, Mr. Chair. That's right. That's always the right answer, except when it's not.

> All right, now we move on to board and staff announcements and we'll start in our usual order from our valued board administrator, Mrs. Mara. No new board announcements, thank you, Mr. Chair. Okay, Attorney Cunningham. No announcements, Mr. Chair. Mr. Feeney. No announcements this evening, thank you. Mrs. Mahan.

> Just leave it to the chair's purview since we're having a special town meeting on and off night. Yes. Usually, when we have a select board meeting, we start at 7. But we can start at 7.15. You set the agenda, but I just wanted to, just traditionally, we start at 7. Very rarely have we started 6.45 and it's usually during select board meetings during annual or special town meetings, the citizens, the open forum usually is an agenda item. But I'll leave that to the chair. But I'm just going to leave in my mind that the 7.15 may be a seven, it may not. I'll leave that up to you.

> Okay, yeah, thank you for that, for bringing that up and I'll make sure I get some clarity on that, particularly for our upcoming meeting. Thank you. No, nothing else. Mr. Hearn. No announcements. Mr. Hearn.

> I am excited to say that I was just re-elected for the fifth term as chair of the advisory council for the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization. And I had just been elected for my first term when people asked me to consider running for select board. And my first question to Mr. Hearn was, can I still do that? Because I was so excited about this position. And as I told my colleagues on the advisory board, I also said, I told this to the town manager and I hope it didn't scare him when I said, you know, I am more idealistic in my, or I'm just as idealistic in my fifth term there. And as I was the first, and I told the town manager, I'm as idealistic about, you know, being on this, be on a select board as I am, you know, for my first term, because I really do believe that government can do good things, you know, and if you work at it, you know, you can really make a positive difference. And I feel that even more so on the advisory council, because another thing you all heard me say a lot is that in any, most other parts of the country, I mean, a location that's five miles, I mean, from a major city would be a neighborhood, I mean, of that city. And it's because of the nature of our politics here in Massachusetts, that we have independence, you know, but we, that means that we all need to work together, you know, in order to make the region work because we sink or swim as a region. And that's what the advisory council to the Boston region metropolitan planning organization is all about. So I'm thrilled, you know, and, and, and so on.

> Congratulations. Thank you for sharing. Okay. And nothing for me other than just to note that our next select board meeting is scheduled for October 23rd prior currently on notice for 6 30 PM. Is that right? October 17th. Oh, so the 17th. Okay. So that is the first night of town. Yeah. The first night of town meeting just to just state that we are in session. Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that makes sense. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So there we go. I think that's it. So adjourn. Second. We have a motion to adjourn. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Aye. Most unanimous. We are adjourned.
