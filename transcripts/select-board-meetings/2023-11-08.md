<details><summary>Remote Participation</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 357</summary>

> Good evening. I'm calling to order this meeting of the Arlington Select Board on Wednesday, November 8th. I am Select Board Chair Eric Helmuth. Tonight's meeting is being conducted in a hybrid format consistent with provisions by the state legislature for remote participations in public meetings. Before we begin, please note the following. First, this meeting is being conducted in the Select Board Chambers and over Zoom. It is being recorded and simultaneously broadcast on ACMI. Second, people wishing to join the meeting by Zoom may find information on how to do so on the town's website. People participating either in person or by Zoom are reminded that you may be visible to others and that if you wish to participate, we ask you to provide your full name in the interest of developing a record of the meeting. Third, all participants are advised that people may be listening who do not provide comment, but those persons are not required to identify themselves. Both Zoom participants and people watching on ACMI can follow the posted agenda materials found on the website of the town, specifically the Select Board Agendas and Minutes page. This evening in the agenda, there are two opportunities in the agenda for public comment. The first will be the licensed hearing for the restaurant, which is item 11, and then following that, the open forum. During the open forum, I'll announce the nature of that, but know that if you are participating on Zoom and you want to participate in public comment, what you will do is raise your hand at that time when I announce the public comment is open. If you don't know how to raise your hand in Zoom, now would be an excellent time to Google for how to do so. Let's see how much of the town's business we can get done tonight. I would be happy to do that. Thank you. Yeah, just raise your hand if I forget. Yeah, I'll make a note. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a general policy. I'm very willing to do that. A member of the public requests. Let's make this a note.

<details><summary>Proclamations</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 122</summary>

> Okay, so we have two proclamations for items two and three. I'll suggest to the board that we dispense with the reading of them. I'm happy to, if a board member would like me to do that. The first one for Bob Sprague, I'm going to be reading at an event on November 15th. I think the proclamation is dated that way. And then small business Saturday will be distributed throughout the, by the town's economic development coordinator and was sent to the small business Saturday association. But leave that to my colleagues. Okay. That is that for attorney coming in? Can we do both items two and three together as a single vote? Or do we need to vote them separately?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 4</summary>

> Separate vote, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 340</summary>

> All right. So let's take up the one for Bob Sprague. So we have Mr. Hurd and Mrs. Mahan. Okay, so a motion in discussion. Motion to approve item two, the proclamation for Rob Sprague by Mr. Hurd and seconded by Mrs. Mahan. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Is unanimous. Item three, the proclamation for small business Saturday. And I'll pause here and say, inform the public that if you do want to see the text of these proclamations, it is published on the town's website and the select board's agendas and minutes page. So small business Saturday proclamation. Looking for motions. Move for approval. All right. Second. All right. Any discussion? That second paragraph was really interesting. I'll be talking to folks about that. They have some really interesting data in it. You know, so that's all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was glad when they, when the association approached me and then I ran it by our staff and DPCD and also the chamber of commerce, commerce lays on this. Oh yeah, we used to do this. And so it's a nice, it's a nice tradition to bring that back to promote, um, small businesses, um, in Arlington, which are really vital to our, to our 1600 businesses in Arlington. I would have guessed half, you know, so, so I'm really impressed. Yeah, no, it's great. It's not, not, not bad for a community of 46,000 people. Mr. Chair, just one thing to add that small business Saturday, uh, is November 25th, 2023. That is worth mentioning. Yes. And we have any, uh, and that's right. And we have a future agenda and coming up while here on the academic consent agenda, um, for that we can talk a little bit about that. Okay. So any further discussion? Thank you for filling that in. So we have a motion to approve a small business Saturday proclamation by Mr. DeCoursey, seconded by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Also unanimous five, nothing votes.

<details><summary>Acceptance of Funds from the Friends of the Robbins Farm Park</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 20</summary>

> All right. Item four for approval, acceptance of funds from the friends of the Robbins farm park. Mr. Town manager.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 240</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the board's consideration this evening, we have a very generous gift, uh, being submitted on behalf of the friends of the Robbins farm park in the amount of $53,000. Uh, this gift is intended to support the renovation project currently underway, uh, at the Robbins farm park playground. And the specific purpose of this gift is to support, uh, inclusive play. So, uh, as is customary, this will be before the board, uh, so that you may formally accept this gift and that will allow us to then deposit these funds separately and spend them directly on the ongoing renovation project that is, uh, you know, designed in such a manner to try to introduce as many inclusive play elements as possible. Sort of the, the first of its nature here in Arlington. So it is a bit of a momentous occasion and on behalf of, uh, the recreation department and the park and recreation commission, I wish to thank the friends for their successful. And as I understand it, ongoing, uh, fundraising efforts that have led to this significant contribution. And if I could, Mr. Chair, I do believe we have a representative from the friends of Robbins farm park, uh, Jim Hampi here this evening, and I would invite him up if we could, please. Uh, we'd be delighted to hear from you, sir. Thank you very much yourself and where you live.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Hampi - 269</summary>

> Yeah, I'm Jim Hampi. I live on Coolidge road in Arlington here. Um, one quick update since we sent that, um, that note to Joe, uh, since that last week, we've actually raised another $5,000. So the check you have there is for $58,000. Um, I presented on behalf of the friends of Robbins farm park board, uh, very happily. And I think more importantly, on behalf of the 350 plus individuals and families who have donated to our campaign. Um, I think it speaks to the incredible support for this amazing park. I think as Jim mentioned, the key issue that I've become very passionate about, I think I speak for the board and have learned the most about is the idea of inclusive playgrounds. And to me, that means not, not only making playgrounds accessible, but making them available for all kids to actually be able to play together. And I hope that we can continue to set the bar higher and higher for what we consider inclusive for playgrounds in Arlington. We're very happy to support that one to say thank you for the town for investing in this amazing park and playground. Thanks to the parks and rec committee and Joe specifically for his leadership and agency landscape and design has created a fantastic design. And then lastly, as Jim mentioned, we're not done. Our goal is 63,000. So we will be back with another $5,000 check as soon as we can. Thanks very much. Another four days. You just came up with three or five since Friday. I'm just teasing. Thank you very much.

<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 431</summary>

> I believe Mrs. Muhammad, I will now turn to the board as I am fond of saying, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Absolutely. Exuberance is, is a very much well deserved. I want to thank you and every person who gave every single dollar and those who continue to do that in the future. And I'm really impressed how you've adopted and endorsed, you know, an inclusive playground as well as I saw a lot of the outreach that you did pre planning for the final plan of what the Robinson playground would look like. And I saw that in there as near the top as item for consideration. I was like, Oh, please, please. I know when Joe Conley, our recreation director, who's fantastic. I think he's also implemented that up at the Arlington Reservoir. And when I see that it's near and dear to my heart. And I know it costs more to do something like that, but it's money well raised and money well spent because all of us, whether it affects us personally or tertiary early, you know, to see something like that and know there's not a hindrance to anyone except for the natural, natural shyness of a kid, you know, that's going to hide behind mom, dad or caretakers, but can't take his left leg until they get used to everybody. But I want to thank you and say that's something that's really near and dear to my heart and the board's heart. And as you said, and as Mr. Conley has done and the town manager want to continue on with that trend as we move forward. But also recognizing it is going to cost more than your traditional playground, but I think it's money well spent. Thanks. And I think for us, raising awareness of the issue is important. And I think one of the things I've learned is, I think I came in thinking there was a bit of a trade off between fun and challenging and inclusive. And that's actually not the case. It has to be fun and challenging for all kids to want to go and get the value of learning to play together. The trade off is I think one of the big ones is the cost. And part of it is that equipment manufacturers aren't currently making standardized inclusive play. So then it's a custom order and the cost go up. Right. So I think the more we can raise awareness and help towns be able to fund it, it's a wonderful cause. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 214</summary>

> Mr. Hurd. Oh, did you? Oh, and I'd like to move approval. Thank you, Mr. Second. And thank you for the amazing contribution and the work. We'll have to get some of your secrets of fundraising. I mean, this Arlington's parks in general are treasures to us, but this one in particular, I think it's near and dear to everyone's heart in Arlington. And a lot of people come in from other towns to come to the Robbins Park. And there's a great look for the town to show that we are taking steps to incorporate inclusive play elements. I can't imagine anything more heart wrenching than seeing a kid sit and watch other kids play. So it's an amazing thing. It's great that that is what you focused on in the improvements, because I think that will really make this park a shining light for other parks and an example for what we do in other areas of town. And I look forward to it. My boys look forward to it. When I was little, we had the long metal slide that shot you about 30 feet across the sand. I thought it was fun, but not the safest. Two huge concrete slides that should be plenty fun. I appreciate it. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 137</summary>

> Thanks. Mr. Diggins. Thank you very much. I mean, and as everyone said, it is money well spent. And as you said, I mean, right now it's more expensive because it's custom. But the more people do it, I mean, then the more it will become standardized. And someone has to lead the way. And I'm glad this community is. I mean, and it is part of our values. I mean, and you have to put your money where your mouth is. So thank you very much. And I want to echo the comments of my colleagues. Thank you very much. And it's just really impressive to see the amount of money that you've raised and what is going to continue to be raised to make an outstanding site that we'll all be proud of. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 228</summary>

> Thank you. I remember, I think it was last summer when the design concepts were being floated in the park because I lived on the street. And actually, with the representative of the organization here, I was thinking to myself, I wonder if my membership's up to date. I mean, I don't know if it's not. But my husband and I have been very glad to be members of the Friends and so grateful for everything the organization does. Not, I mean, this fundraising is incredible. And thank you for that. But also the events in the parks, some of the best event posters in town. And we know who to thank for that. But the work that the organization does to really help the community embrace and enjoy the park is just so valuable. And, you know, easy for me to say because I go walk to the park and I do every day. But I think for the entire community, it's really a joyful place for everyone to gather. And this will make it even more so for all children. So thank you. So we have a motion to gratefully accept the gift of $58,000 from the Friends of the Robbins Farm Park by Mrs. Mahan and seconded by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Unanimous. Thank you. Thank you very much.

<details><summary>Consent Agenda</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 94</summary>

> All right. Now move to the consent agenda. We have the minutes of meetings from September 27th, October 11th, October 17th, and October 23rd. Requests for free parking for local holiday shopping by Beth Locke, the Executive Director of the Arlington Chamber of Commerce, and from Janet O'Riordan from the Arlington Heights Community Association, we have a request for some traffic customization around the holiday stroll in the Arlington Heights on December the 9th. I do, I think we can, with the board's consent, as it were, we can vote all these at once.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Request: Free Parking for Local Holiday Shopping</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 229</summary>

> But I do want to point out on the item for item 6, the request for local holiday shopping. I think that is worth enumerating just for the public's information. So let me just go to that. Sorry, I'm having some computer problems here. So the town has, I think traditionally we've done this, I think every year that I can remember, that we have allowed the parking lot in the center of town to be free during the holiday shopping season. And the proposal before us, this would be the Russell Common and also the Water Street Municipal lot, so the two lots that are there, would have free parking on Saturday, November 23rd, I'm sorry, November 25th. Saturday the 25th, Saturday, December 2nd, Saturday, December 9th, Saturday, December 16th, and Saturday, December 23rd, 2023. And this is a way to really support the small businesses on the holiday shopping season and the residents who are going to be there. I'll also note it in this letter that the first lights in the Whittemore Park ceremony, which is a popular event to kick off the season, will be happening on Thursday, the 30th of November at 6 p.m. at the Dollar Museum as well, right there. So, but that's just for the public's benefit, and I'll leave it to the board for motions, discussion on the consent agenda.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth and Others - 341</summary>

> I'll make a motion. I do note on the last item on the consent agenda, the holiday stroll, did it request a police officer? I didn't see that confirmed, so I just wanted to... Looks like the police detail is checked yes. Yeah. And there's a reference to that. As in that they want that, you know, but it just didn't indicate that it had been granted, you know, so just, so I'm assuming it's gone where it needs to go, but I just don't want to, you know, I mean, I'm assuming that, but I don't think we should assume that, so we just to make sure that, you know, it has gone where it needs to go so that whoever needs to sign off on the detail will do that. I want to ask Mrs. Marr, but, Ms. Marr, sorry. Well, it says in there that they're in contact with Officer Roteau as well as Dan Warren for the police and DPW. I think it says will contact. Will contact, yeah. Is that your understanding, Ms. Marr? That's correct. It's the applicant's responsibility to reach out to the police department for details. Sometimes they can be filled. Sometimes they can't. They are in contact. If the police department is able to fill the detail, it will be filled. Go ahead. Just a question for the town manager on that. If the detail cannot be filled, what happens and what do you recommend would be the action? I would recommend the event still proceed as planned, and if there were any issues, we would call for the on-call sector car. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, thank you for raising that up. Thank you, Ms. Marr. Okay, any other discussion? I think I need a second for the consent agenda. All right, so for the consent agenda items five through seven, we have a motion to approve all subject to conditions by, I assume, by Mr. Diggins and seconded by Mr. Hurt. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous.

<details><summary>Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 40</summary>

> Okay, that brings us to appointments. First up, we have the Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee. Appointee Linda Epstein or Epstein. Hi, come on up. Sure, you're very welcome. It's for us, Christopher Toppins. Nice that we have two chairs, though.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christopher Toppins? - 200</summary>

> He's not able to join, but he wanted to mention that he is aware of Linda's leadership skills, in part because of her participation in the softball team, which I only learned of today, but I've known Linda for some years as a non-voting member of our committee, and I think, I don't know, showing up is a is a key part of the job, and she's certainly been doing that and contributing to our discussions, and I think many of you know Linda through her efforts as a citizen member of the committee on Appleton. I think one of the most challenging things that the bicycle community has faced in my time in our town, and so I think you see her contribution in helping to architect a solution that preserves the safety of all users of the road and meets all the other needs of the town. So we are very pleased to recommend Linda Epstein as the new executive board member for the Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee. Thank you very much. It's a ringing endorsement. Ms. Epstein, if you'd like to say a few words about your interest and what you'd like to accomplish in the role.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Linda Epstein - 107</summary>

> Thanks, Doug. Yes, I've got involved. I'm an avid cyclist. I rode into Cambridge to work for many years, and now I ride the other direction to Bedford. I use the bike path a lot more now, so I'm interested in some improvements there, and the Appleton project was very personal for me because I know I knew the family or I know the family of Charlie Proctor so but I'm really excited to be working with the town and different committees and help advise and help promote safe cycling in Arlington and yeah I'm looking forward to joining the committee in a official capacity so thanks.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 16</summary>

> Thank you very much and I'll turn to the board. Motions, questions, discussion?  Mrs. Mahon.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 120</summary>

> Excuse me, first I'd like to move approval and say thank you so much. I know you're not as has been stated you're not a stranger to the Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee, still ABAC right? Sometimes they change so and to me that demonstrates a great commitment that you have been participating for years and thank you to your family, your husband, because I know it's a sacrifice away from your family once you volunteer because we can't afford to pay you all here in the town of Arlington but I'm very appreciative that there's really no learning curve and you're ready to go on day one and thanks for stepping up to the plate and doing this. Thank you
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 72</summary>

> Mr. Chairman and thank you Ms. Epstein for your willingness to serve and I'm really impressed by your bicycling summary here and a note for the public you've been volunteering for the Pan Mass Challenge since 1997 so well done on that and the list of activities in your experience will really assist the Bicycle Advisory Committee so thank you and if I didn't say second I'll second this is Mahon's motion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 219</summary>

I think they actually belong to the they have a membership on the Regional Transportation Advisory Council you know for the Boston region and so I'm familiar with them and and I would I would very much like at some point in time you know I'm in to talk with you about the experience with the Mass Ave Appleton Design Review Committee you know just to kind of like de-brief on that and understand me how we about that process and how we can maybe make a similar process better you know so so I'm not gonna ask you now I mean for any comments on it but but I just like to talk with you I mean partly as a member of the board but also I mean as the liaison to the Transportation Advisory Committee and I'll just say you probably know about this already that um there is the bike lane design guide that's well underway and I got a glimpse of it you know earlier this weekend looks good so so yeah yeah it's more a lot from that you know so thank you thank you yeah thank you very much yeah
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 167</summary>

> I think mr. de Corsi said your your resume here is it's really really impressive and you know I think you'll just continue to do great things even great things as an official member of the committee and thank you to to the bicycle advisory committee that you know you have been a stable and driving force for improvements in the town for many many years I am personally grateful for it as a born-again bicyclist in my mid to late 50s I have begun to benefit from from those things and now on the ground or on the street as it were nothing like being there yourself to start to under appreciate good and bad bicycle infrastructure and the possibilities so so I'm personally interested but also as a town official and appreciative for what you do so we have a motion to appoint by mrs.

<details><summary>	 Olga Baker - 212</summary>

> sure yeah I'm Olga Baker right on Marathon Street now I'm East Arlington I was very excited about this committee for a few reasons actually took my time trying to pick up the right phone for me my initial goal was just personal trying to get more involved in town operations I'd say Arlington is probably the first place I've lived that is now feeling like my home for the foreseeable future I've been in Cambridge beforehand and my husband is born and raised here so I want to just get more involved in having a small child it's important for me to figure out how I can help out so the economic development and tourism it's particularly interesting just because I have a let's say a fairly diverse and cultured background from living in different places and doing lots of travel I'm also very inspired in my travels to see how different towns and cities operate and trying to sort of draw people in and you know hopefully spend money and just increase activity so I'm hoping to be inspired to do this for Arlington as well and I myself am an entrepreneur small business owner so I think this would be a great opportunity to just meet more like-minded people
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 154</summary>

> thank you very much and I'll turn to the board for discussion Mr. Herb move approval thank you for your willingness to serve I'm on the committee I don't think I'm a liaison I think I'm on this particular committee but it's fun committee we do a lot of good we're really kind of geared towards promoting small businesses in town and then we've a lot of work coming up the next couple years for the 2025 celebration so I'm sure once you jump right in we'll we'll start getting involved with that but it's a good group it's it's good mix of people that have been here for 50 years and people that have lived here for you know just three or four years so look forward to working with you and thank you for stepping up and serving thank you so much all right well someone has to second at some point
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 154</summary>

> second yeah thank you thank you sir your service anybody else before mr. Diggins goes last all right you're up so I am thrilled you know to welcome you aboard me you're young your resume me was a delight to read you know what I liked about it was that it it it gave hints it made you want to like ask you more you know and so so I I will hopefully have a chance to meet and talk to me for a little prolonged period at some point but but just a couple little questions now so one is kind of a little deep into what you you you wrote you you said that you you have worked on a second let me pull it up you promoted grower friendly processes to reduce the burden of data collection on farmers I just I'm trying to understand me what's a grower friendly process
</details>
<details><summary>	 Olga Baker - 889</summary>

> yeah oh my gosh you're taking me back into my corporate world but that wasn't too long ago so so to everybody else the company I was working for it was in food tech I have them as separate masters and food policy so I'm very interested in sustainable food and also poverty alleviation so on but that's a bit of a detour so I was working for a company that was working on carbon capture initiatives you know carbon drawdown working with farmers to figure out how they can farm and do agriculture in a way that's more environmentally friendly and capture carbon in the soil and so when you think about a farmer that's out there working you know 14 16 hour days physical labor but then they're asked by a corporation to collect a bunch of data and have technology involved and you know be part of meetings and just a type of a type of work structure that they've never really done before and frankly don't have an interest in doing because they got to do their farming so grower friendly practices are about how can we minimize the technological burden and take time away from farmers valuable time and make as easy for them as possible to collect and record data regarding the carbon sequestration in their soil I'm glad I asked me so if that was not what I'm expecting but I'm glad I asked because that kind of challenge I think we see in lots of venues me where you have an employee me that has a lot of work to do mean and then they're being asked me well we want this to you know because that will help me the the enterprise function better and it's like well yeah we understand the goal but now I need to do this on top of me what you've asked me to do I'm already really busy and so the kind of solutions that you deploy for that me I could see having applicability elsewhere not necessarily part of what you do on on this committee but still I'm glad I asked me and I do like what you said about you challenge the status quo inquisitively and so I'm kind of curious as to meet an example of where you did that me and and how you could potentially do that with the tourism economic and tourism group yeah so this is I think I did that everywhere I went for for not just my 10 years in corporate but just in my life it's really a personality trait for better or worse I tend to ask a lot of questions and depends on the crowd sometimes that's well-received and sometimes that's just seen as you know nagging time-consuming but that's really how I get to the root cause of problems but you know I it's very difficult for me to just accept that face value a process that's been in place for 50 years or documents that have been used just because somebody created them back in the day I really want to know why everything is in place today and is it necessary you know as a duplicative obviously I'm all about efficiency but also is it benefiting just one party is it one-sided you know so I always just it takes me a good amount of time and every job that I've done I take a lot of time at the beginning to get to know everybody that's involved and ask a lot of questions for how we got to where we are today and I find that just makes the execution of whatever needs to get done a lot faster and easier even though may seem overdrawn at the beginning so that's how I prefer to operate obviously you know I've worked with people in sales and marketing and engineering that have their competing priorities and they're not always willing to do the operational grunt work of with those sorts of timelines so that's where the competing priorities come in but as much as I can get an understanding of what are the principles or people or dynamics that got us to where we are today it's just much easier to think ahead for the future and yeah maybe challenge the status quo because sometimes it's just outdated or not relevant especially at the end it with me thinking about the future because for me meet I'm especially with tourism means and in Arlington in particular I think it's more so that we need to build something that's going to bring people to Arlington yes it has this history a but I think there is more potential in creating something that's going to want to make people come to Arlington and so so just let's think about me what it is that we could do you know that could bring people and at the same time he creates some new growth you know and I think I think you're a person that that would can do that but also would take a lot of joy in doing it so I am thrilled just thrilled me to have you on board I think you're going to benefit that group mean it in the town a lot so thank you

> Thank You mr. chair I think what you said was very salient in the fact that Shaina served well on the MBTA communities working group which was stood up at this time last year in the lead-up to special town meeting this fall so Shaina understands well the amount of time the level of commitment and the public interest in the work of the Redevelopment Board so I think that you know not only did she perform admirably and the director of planning in community development you know was thrilled that Shaina was interested I'm also you know glad when someone knows exactly what it is they're getting into with the with the heightened level of interest in scrutiny on the work of the Redevelopment Board I think it was important for someone to know what they were signing up for in a way so we you know thanks Shaina for stepping forward
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 61</summary>

> thank you so we'll hear from from Shaina or from Miss Corman who's Houston and then we'll have an opportunity for board questions or comments and then I know there's a member of the public who would like to address the board so we'll do that at the very end before we take our vote so go ahead with your presentation
</details>
<details><summary>	 Shaina Korman-Houston - 109</summary>

> thanks and thank you for having me this evening I moved to Arlington about two years ago and it's been a real pleasure becoming part of the town community I have been so impressed since I moved here about how the town thinks about its priorities and how to translate those priorities into zoning and I feel like that's a place where I can bring my talents to the town and my experience to the town and I just be so honored to be able to do that so yeah so when the planning director suggested to me that this might be something to explore I was very excited
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 198</summary>

> thank you very much I'll turn to the board for discussion mr. heard a move approval and again thank you for your willingness to step up and serve it's a lot of time luckily you got in at a good time because you just wrapped up the special town meeting that they took up a lot of time with redevelopment board but it never really lets up but you know the town relies on the redevelopment board for you know for all the zoning matters and there's a lot of zoning matters that are going to continue to come up for years to come affordable housing is really a major issue in town and how we do that is very difficult so the road ahead is is hard but we're making progress and luckily for this board we can always whenever someone asks about zoning we say oh that's not us go talk to the redevelopment board because we we know nothing about zoning we don't want to know nothing about zoning but did you see my questions from ACMI for but again thank you for your willingness to serve and I look forward to working with you
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 120</summary>

> I'll second that thank you as the manager said you know what you're getting into and you want more so we couldn't ask for anything one better thank you thank you mr. chairman and yeah thank you for your willingness to serve mr. heard referred to one of the other committees tonight as a fun committee I'm sure the redevelopment board is all that much fun but it's really interesting work and it's really important work and we appreciate your willingness to serve and I am impressed by your background in affordable housing and impressed by the thesis that you've performed at the University of North Carolina on low-income housing tax credit property so best of luck and thanks again
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 404</summary>

> well depends on your definition of fun mrs. Mahan I think I heard correctly that you were a brave soul and were involved with the MBTA communities two years seemed like four score and 72 years process and one of the things that I was really impressed with that and I think really served at the functionality at the special town meeting ultimately article 12 MBTA communities being successful was that that was a very long arduous process with so many different competing points of view as well as what the state law and the governor of Massachusetts mandates outlines were and in taking all those different forces and then saying these are the constraints unto which we can apply that I think you you and that committee really demonstrated great volunteerism and expertise to the town and one of the things I was really impressed with and I think you did you chair that committee oh you did not okay blanking on that but one of the things I was impressed with that that you can bring to the redevelopment board is you know starting at the initial phase going out listening not taking things you know keep listening ears on and not taking things personally which is very difficult to do a lot of people say oh tell me anything I won't take a personal that's but then coming up in the end with the proposal that that was successful not just for town meeting but for the town of Arlington so and not that I have and I was only joking about the redevelopment board because I had a recent re-election and all the questions came up there were more about zoning and other things and I want to talk about select board but my years from going to the redevelopment board as a citizen activist neighborhood activist one of the things I've always appreciated with redevelopment board members is Similar to what a previous appointees spoke about that just because something's set in place and Appears to be a proven formula that doesn't mean you can't relook at it. Maybe come up with the exact same Zoning type of zoning but may be able to tweak it and and custom it customize it for the future So and I'm thrilled to see a woman on the redevelopment board and look forward to working with you as a colleague Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 119</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Thank you in addition to seconding all the appreciation for my colleagues I'll just note that I also noticed and really appreciate your pretty deep background in affordable housing development and I'm privileged to be the select boards liaison and member to the affordable housing trust fund of Board of Trustees and that's a group that's fairly new getting off the ground, but it's full of a lot of very talented people and I'd love to to think of you as a resource and it may be an opportunity for for some brainstorming and some collaboration between The housing trust fund and the redevelopment board where that would make sense because I think there's some exciting possibilities
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 63</summary>

> Well, thank you very much I think that concludes our questions for you if you want to take a seat in the front row in case we want to call You back and I'll invite the member any member of the public who wants to comment on this appointment Sir just to have a seat introduce yourself and Before you address the board.

<details><summary>	 Barry Jaspin - 540</summary>

> Okay. Thank you Good evening. My name is Barry Jaspin. I live it on Campbell Road in Arlington I'd like to start by thanking the select board for allowing me to speak tonight and and Regarding the candidate Shana Corman Houston. I'd also like to thank miss Corman Houston for her recent contributions to Arlington Via the MBTA Communities Act Working Group and her willingness to give even more of her time to Arlington via the ARB I do not know miss Corman Houston personally, but I'm sure she is an upstanding and civic-minded resident of our town That said I am here tonight to speak against her nomination to the ARB Miss Corman Houston is presently employed as the real estate director at the Planning Office of Urban Affairs Which is part of the Archdiocese of Boston as many of you may already know The Poet Corner neighborhood is facing a significant issue regarding the potential sale and development of land owned by the Archdiocese of Boston Across the street from Camillus Church and adjacent to the Poet Corner Park on Dow Ave known as zero Kipling Road For the record. I am in a butter of zero Kipling Road The neighborhood has long-standing concerns regarding the development of this parcel dating back to when the Archdiocese last tried to sell it 20 years ago the concerns are primarily related both to public health since the parcel is a formal dump former dump site containing known toxins and Environmental impact since it includes a wetland and there are some other concerns as well Zero Kipling Road is presently listed for sale and thus questions about its development are almost certain to come before the ARB during this Candidates term it seems to me inappropriate for the Archdiocese to gain increased influence over the ARB By having their director of real estate on the board precisely when they expect to have contested business before that board Given her unavoidable conflict of interest. I request that this candidates nomination be declined until Zero Kipling Road issue is resolved. I would certainly support her candidacy after that Furthermore this candidate was only nominated on November 1st one week ago tonight Giving the neighborhood very little time to learn about her nomination evaluate the candidate and consider nominating an alternative candidate if Declining the nomination is too big of an ask I request that it be tabled to allow the neighborhood to find and nominate an alternate candidate for consideration Given the upcoming holidays. I suggest January as a time for reconsideration Finally before voting on approving miss Corman Houston either today tonight or in the future I strongly urge that you ask her to formally commit to recusing herself from any and all discussions or votes Related to archdiocese business and to record her answer in the minutes and this Idea came to me as I saw. Mr. DeCoursey recused himself during recent discussions of the Appleton redevelopment Which I was very impressed with you know, as you basically, you know stepped out of the room for that whole conversation I thought that was terrific. I don't even know what your conflict is. But anyway Anyway, that was my statement. Thank you
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 195</summary>

> Has any reaction or discussion Mr. DeCoursey, yeah reaction and the reference there from time to time there members of boards that that find themselves in a situation where they need to recuse themselves if the Circumstances so warrant and I view that as a case-by-case Type situation I've had it a few times. Mr. Hurd it has had mr. The chair, mr. Helmuth has had it. So I I don't view that That if there is a potential I'm not saying there's a conflict right now but I don't I don't view the potential for a conflict on a particular matter to be something that goes to the candidates qualifications for the for a board in this case the redevelopment board and I think if a matter comes up and If miss corn Houston is approved tonight I imagine that I expect that that she will look if there is a conflict and recuse herself if she deems it appropriate after Consulting with Town Council, but I I don't view it as a qualification That I need to pass on as a member of the select board. So that's where I stand on that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Hurd - 119</summary>

> Mr. Yeah, I just reiterate that Because I mean this is we're all local and we're dealing with issues that touch the people we know and you know, we have businesses and so if Some issue comes up then we recuse ourselves. I don't think we should we'd go off of a potential Issue that isn't even in process right now Which I don't think the redevelopment board would even hear anything related to that property that would be the Zoning Board of Appeals in the Environmental board my brains Conservation Commission, but anyways Yeah, I mean if a Conflict comes up we recuse ourselves. But again, that doesn't disqualify a candidate who's going to serve I Thank you,
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 158</summary>

> mr. Chair Michael Cunningham Town Council if I could just weigh in at this point, I think I would I would confirm what has been said by Select board member to Corsi and select board member heard that from we don't know all the specific facts but the objection as as Elicited tonight would not qualify as a blanket disqualification for the nominee to the extent. There's a later Conflict of interest under 268 a the individual could recuse herself But I think I agree with attorney heard that most likely this particular project would probably go be going before the Zoning Board of Appeals And Conservation Commission anyway But again, if there was a specific factual circumstance that wanted a warranted of recusal that could be taken up at that time I do not believe the objection as voiced tonight Qualifies as a reason for blanket disqualification and this this candidate is appropriate for this board's consideration
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 155</summary>

> Thank You attorney coming in mr. Dickens. I'm gonna potentially through invite mr. I'm feeling to weigh in on this respect to tabling the Candidate because because we my understanding is that this position was open for a while And the normal course of action, I'm sorry The normal course of action, you know is that me the town manager conducts the search mean and then will recommend me someone to us mean and Open meeting law requires that we provide 48 hours, you know notice me that I really welcome the input I mean from residents on this me, but it would be really a Deviation from the normal process me to table this me And if the town manager wants to correct me if I said anything wrong I invite him to if he wants to say anything more, but he doesn't have to either So Sure, thank you. Mr. Chair. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 562</summary>

> Mr. Diggins. I would just say that yes, this vacancy has existed since January of This year, so I know the Redevelopment Board and the director of planning community development are eager to get someone else on the board and weighing in on Matters that will be before them in the coming weeks and months I'll go last I Just want to be in the process person that I am Appointments to the Redevelopment Board that's under the purview of the town manager the role that we have We really can't I guess we could as a matter of courtesy talk about tabling, but we just can only vote yes or no we don't solicit candidates and we don't have any other involvement in the process and I think the Great benefit that we have with this candidate and other candidates out that we approve tonight and other nights and sometimes it Can cut both ways is if you live in Arlington Unless you're Independently rich and never want to work again. You do have a job and in some sphere I myself have in the past had to recuse myself from a meeting and as a professional man or woman when that Does arise you certainly are aware of that and you take yourself out of that situation? so that's you know, so I apologize that we're going on and on about this because I know you're well-versed about it and Where it is the Redevelopment Board Our Redevelopment Board members if you look at their resume their curriculum vitae You'll see they have a background in some form of development whether it's real estate an attorney So on and so forth and it's been that way since I've been on the board select board since 1999 so Respectfully We can't table we can either vote. Yes or no, and I just want to apologize that you kind of stepped into this mire Because I'm still very very excited This has been a first we have I had other candidates and this hasn't happened before And I'm as I said before I'm looking for a forward to a professional woman Serving on the Redevelopment Board and bringing your expertise that and in regarding the archdiocese project We don't even know what it is yet We really can't get into any of those logistics as far as I know they Haven't even put it out to bid or anything. They put out feelers and sort of informational But there's been nothing official so to start to opine on that. I think would get us all Going down a road that could hurt all parties involved neighbors The archdiocese and whatever else comes out of that so this board is certainly aware of that process the town manager Has kept us a form informed. We're waiting to see when anything official Is decreed it hasn't happened yet, so we I? Mean that's not even the basis, so I would like to continue and Move forward with this appointment any further discussion Appreciate all the comments this evening, and I think we're ready for a vote so we have a motion to approve by mr. Hurd and seconded by mr. Diggins all in favor of appointment. Please say aye aye It is a five nothing appointment congratulations. Thank you for your service. Thank you

<details><summary>Vote: Date for 2024 Annual Town Election</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 30</summary>

> Moving on to item 12, under traffic rules and orders and other business. We have a vote. The date for the 2024 annual town election. Tis the season. Attorney Cunningham.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 116</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, items number 12 and 13 could be taken in conjunction. Yeah. The first is a vote for setting the annual town election for 2024. Pursuant to the bylaw, that should be the first Saturday in April, unless there's some extenuating circumstance. I did review the calendar for any religious holidays and don't see any that would necessarily conflict with that weekend. I think the Christian Easter is March 31st. I think it's towards the end of Ravanam and it does not conflict Passover either. So, if the board wanted to set the town election 2024 for April 6th, 2024, it could do so without conflicting with any holidays on that weekend.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 13</summary>

> All right. Okay. Any discussion and motions from the board?  Mrs. Mahon.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 23</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 125</summary>

> All right. No problem. And it's at this point that you see the rest of your chair just flash. Yeah. It's that soon? It'll be fine. It'll be fine. I think that I'll just note that this is approved, I think, by extension. That means that we can plan for a select board meeting on Monday, the 8th, as it would be required, right, for the following election. So, I'm putting that on my calendar now. I'm assuming this passes. Any further discussion on the date for the annual town election? Okay. Okay. We have a motion to set the election for Saturday, April 6th, 2024, by Mrs. Mahon, and seconded by Mr. DeCorsi. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous.

<details><summary>For Approval: Opening of Warrant for Annual Town Meeting 2024</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 14</summary>

> Item 13, opening of the warrant for the annual town meeting 2024, Attorney Cunningham.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 174</summary>

> With that, thank you, Mr. Chair, Michael Cunningham, Acting Town Council. Oh, we'll get to that at the end of the meeting, I guess. With that date set, that would provide for the appropriate amount of time. So, if the town election is set on April 6th, the town meeting could occur, as required, under the bylaws on the 4th, Monday in April. So, the annual town meeting would, therefore, be set April 22nd, 2024. And, in advance of that, obviously, on the agenda item to set the opening of the warrant, pursuant to bylaws, Article 1 needs to be set. And the suggestion in the memo is that the warrant be opened on December 8th, 2023, and then it close on January 26th, 2024. That would be consistent with the requirements set forth in the bylaw. I would just, perhaps, suggest a friendly amendment to the motion that the notice of intent to open that warrant be posted no later than December 1st, 2023, if the board agrees that those dates are appropriate.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 17</summary>

> Excellent. All right. Who's going to do it? I have a question. Yes. Discussion first, of course.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 44</summary>

> Yes. And we traditionally, in November, announce, after we set the local election date, the opening and closing of the warrant. And I just, if I could, Mr. Chair, through you, I had put down December 4th. Can I just ask why December 8th?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 59</summary>

> I have no affinity to either date. December 4th, that could be the date if the select board chooses, Ms. Mahan. There's no requirement. It's typically the first week of December. I noticed it was always a Friday in previous, and it was always the first full week, so I didn't put it on the first. But if the...
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 61</summary>

> Okay. Nope. Then I'll go with your eighth. So I'd like to, if I could, Mr. Chair, make a motion that, with the date being set, that the warrant open for the annual 2024 town meeting on December 8th, 2023, and will remain open until Friday, January 26th, 2024. And then we have the friendly amendment suggestion to, about the notice?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 24</summary>

> With notice posted of the intent to open the warrant no later than December 1st, 2023. That work for you? Yes. Okay. All right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins and Others - 142</summary>

> So we are setting the beginning of town meeting for the 22nd. Right. So here's my issue with that, is that the election is on the 6th. That's just like 16 days between the election and the beginning of town meeting, with the school vacation, the spring vacation in there also. I imagine starting the 15th and running that week. And so I'm thinking about precinct meetings. It's just leaving so little time for the new town. We have to wait for the new town meeting, for the elections, for the new town meeting members. It's just so little time. And so I just want us to think about that as we make the decision. Are we locked into the 22nd? We're locked into the 4th. We don't have the option of the 5th. Right? I believe Attorney Cunningham has some contribution.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 26</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Unfortunately, Mr. Diggins, there is not much flexibility and it can't be moved to an earlier date pursuant to the town bylaws.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 206</summary>

> Well, that takes care of that. It is what it is. And just if I could add to that, when I first got on the board, the warrant would be open for usually about a week, sometimes two weeks at most. And then Mr. Warden, several years ago, wrote a warrant article that was this board approved and town meeting approved that it should be open for at least four weeks. And what the board did was, and one of the things I'd like to stress, which right now I understand I have to call him Acting Town Counsel, that once the warrants does open, as all department heads and boards, commissions, committees that have anything proposed, we do take advantage of the fact that we do have a town counsel to look that over. And it is not a requirement, but any citizens that do have a warrant article, there is the opportunity and I would encourage them to avail themselves of that opportunity. It doesn't cost anything to discuss and present your, if you feel so inclined, your warrant article to the town counsel and town counsel's office to make sure that it's smooth sailing from the initial get-go. So thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth and Michael Cunningham - 56</summary>

> The most excellent sermon, Mrs. Mahon. Attorney Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'd just like to make one more point that I did run these proposed dates by the town clerk and she informed me that they would work in terms of the annual town election and the first night of town meeting. Important consideration indeed.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 54</summary>

> Mr. DeCourcy. And I realize it's tight this year, but this is one of those instances because April 1st is a Monday, the 4th, so it's the tightest it will ever be, but that's going to happen every six years or however it is when you don't have a leap year. We will cope.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 82</summary>

> All right. I think I need a second unless I just failed to write it down. No, there's no second yet. Second. Oh, now there is. All right. I want to know your chair is not losing his mind, at least not over this. All right. We have a motion as stated by Mrs. Mahon and seconded by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. Thank you. And thank you, Attorney Cunningham, for your good work.

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. For consideration this evening, I'm hoping to seek the board's support for the installation of two stop signs at the intersection of Brooks Avenue and Elmhurst Road. The board may recall at their September 11th meeting that multiple residents of Brooks Avenue and Elmhurst Road submitted myriad correspondence outlining various concerns they, as abutters, were experiencing on their roadway. These same concerns were lodged again at the October 11th Transportation Advisory Committee meeting, at which point that body discussed the situation at length and reviewed data that had been collected by Officer Corey Roteau of the Arlington Police Department. And while the data that was collected and analyzed did not necessarily show concerns with either speed or volumes, it did appear there was consensus that there was certain driver behaviors that could be impacted or hopefully corrected with the installation of stop signs. And in your packet, you did receive sort of a street view looking at the intersection. And you may notice it is sort of a skewed L that sort of, you know, is not necessarily a hard left turn, but, you know, makes a gradual turn around the corner. And it's not a traditional T intersection because on the other leg of the intersection is actually a private driveway. So even my own personal observations, I've been down here a few times. In fact, you know, this is something we had discussed with residents a number of years ago prior to the private way betterment as being a concern that may result from a future paving project. And alas, you know, here we are discussing it. But the concern being that motorists tend to not stop at this as if it were an intersection, but instead to proceed around the bend as if it was one continuous road. So I know this had been discussed at TAC, and there was generally consensus, though they did not have the opportunity to wrote a recommendation. We did note that based on that consensus and agreement amongst relevant town staff, including, again, Officer Corey Roteau, but also Bill Copathorn, the Assistant Town Engineer, and John Alessi, our Senior Transportation Planner. We thought that this is something to sort of expedite this and try to get this in before winter sets in that we would advance this evening for the Board's consideration. And there will be one other recommendation, and that is it is purported that sort of application based traffic directing apps may be unduly burdening this neighborhood with, you know, volumes of vehicles they hadn't seen before. So with that, another recommendation we have is that we have the means to reach out to some of these vendors to make note of what our current time-limited entry restrictions to make sure that those are known as regulatory considerations by these mapping apps so that during those periods of time there is a higher rate of compliance with those time-limited entry restrictions. So happy to take any questions.

<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth and Jim Feeney - 85</summary>

> One thing I will note is that this is not necessarily something that would need to be entered into Schedule 4 of the Traffic Rules and Orders because this is not considered an isolated stop. Again, we'd be essentially installing SOP signs to enforce what is the existing right of way and sort of rules of the road. And does this require a select board vote for the two actions that you recommended? Or do you want one? We're seeking support for this action, yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 342</summary>

> Mr. Dickens. So I'll move approval of the recommendation. And I will add that the reason this is we're kind of trying to expedite the process and put in a new way of handling, you know, these matters that come before a select board. As you may have noticed lately, all things dealing with road issues, I've been sending to the town manager. And that's what we're going to try and do more of is just send them to the town manager and he triages them, you know, hopefully can solve them all, you know. But anything that can't or anything he feels should go to TAC, he'll just send on to TAC. But if he can work it out with his staff, then it'll just come back to us for approval. So the only reason it went to TAC initially was because I had not had conversations with the town manager about doing it this way. And so they deliberated on it, you know. And then we've had that conversation and sent it on to the town manager. And now instead of waiting for TAC to deliberate on it, as they are tonight, and then get it back to us with an additional lag of a couple of weeks minimum, it'll just make things a lot smoother. And I think make Officer Brito a lot happier, too, because he's been wanting to do something like this, you know. And what I suggested initially was that we send everything to TAC and the chair could then determine what goes to the town manager or whomever. We didn't necessarily have to deal with an ATT&CK meeting. But this is even faster because the town manager's here. We don't have to wait for TAC to have a meeting. And I think it'll just be a lot smoother. And there may be one more step in the process. But I'll talk a little more about that with the town manager and then bring that back to the board for consideration. So that's it. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 300</summary>

> Mr. Gorsuch. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll second Mr. Diggins' motion. And I appreciate the memo from the town manager. And I'm familiar with this. I'll call it a curve. Because if you're going down it, cars will just treat it as one road. So I think that's a good improvement. But it also shows where we are approving private way betterments. And this happened a while ago. We saw it on Regis Road, too. This is maybe the third step on Elmhurst. But it's something that we need to consider and encourage people to come back to us as traffic usage changes. But if I could, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Mr. Diggins' comments on having this come from the town manager. And it just made me think of another intersection that we got a number of letters on from concerned residents. And I know we referred it to TAC, but may have asked the town manager. And that's the intersection of Churchill Ave and Gray Street. And I bring that up because I was walking through there. I was coming through Monotony Rocks Park and then heading down to Mass Ave recently. And that's a dangerous intersection. And I avoided it. Or a car was coming up Gray Street, and I had to scoot across. And not that easy for me these days. But it's something that I thought about where that is in the process. So I encourage that type of thing where there was a number of letters and there was a lot of concern. Maybe that's the type of thing that we can ask the town manager to follow up on and come back to us, particularly what we've heard from different members of the public. And maybe it eases the burden on TAC as well.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth - 217</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Jacorsi. I just want to add my personal emphasis to that because that was a resident who reached out to me. And I actually went down and met with the resident, the parent of the child, who had the very frightening incident. And we had a lot of community input, I remember, on the screen here at Zoom. And I think that for situations like that, I would encourage a similar response when we've had a lot of that, to just really have extra vigilance and awareness of the timeliness of the response and just exploring the full range of options that the town has for deploying its expertise, which includes the TAC but also includes the individuals that the town manager recommended, so that we can do some prioritization and have a high degree of confidence of responsiveness to the circumstances. So I would add that request to the town manager and also to our TAC liaison to maybe look at that issue. I know that I'm creeping a little bit on the scope on the issue, but I think that the process that Mr. Diggins kind of led off with, which I really appreciate, by the way, I think that this is germane to sort of how the board handles these requests.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 302</summary>

> Mrs. Mahon. And I'll try to be really brief, but I know it's something that was discussed over the years, and it was speed bumps, and we don't do that, but I know about a year ago, maybe even a little bit longer, Mr. Chapdelaine might have been here, and Mr. Rademacher, our DPW director, was here, and somebody from this board, I don't know if it's current or a former colleague, raised about speed bumps, and one of the things we had an initial discussion on, and we haven't picked back up on it, and since we have the new town manager and we're talking about solutions that TAC and our representative to TAC could bring back, as well as solutions similar to what we've done here, We've taken one thing off the tax platter, is if the town manager could, because I know Mr. Rademach indicated about a year, maybe two, two and a half years ago now, the time's flying, re-looking at something to see if it's something we can or cannot do, and what was discussed, and it was said that we'd talk about it in the future, is not speed bumps, but the raised crosswalks that we see in other communities. So, just to take advantage of this opportunity to our tax representative, before you bring that back to them, I wanna just refer it to the town manager so he can have that conversation with Mr. Rademacher, Rademacher, I should say this, Boston accent, and however we deal with it in the future, if it is something that is going to be for consideration, I would ask the chair and the town manager to discuss that, whether it should be an agenda item with the DPW, or not. So, I'll stop there, thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 66</summary>

> Thank you, Mrs. Mahon. Any further discussion? Okay, so we have a recommendation, we have a motion to support the recommended improvements from the town manager by Mr. Diggins, and seconded by Mr. DeCorsi. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Is unanimous, thank you for your work, Mr. Feeney, and also by extension to your team, and also Mr. Diggins, and to the TAC.

<details><summary>Draft Comments Re: Alewife CSO</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 45</summary>

> Okay, item 15, draft comments regarding the Alewife combined sewer overflows, and just a note to my vice chair, I actually don't need to recuse myself from this because we're not going down the road, at least this evening, of a letter to the legislature.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 628</summary>

> Mr. Feeney. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, this agenda item is certainly of particular interest in the community, it's something we've heard not only more and more about in recent years, but especially this past summer, it was a particularly wet summer, and there were a number of instances where we had significant discharges into the Alewife Brook, some of which were so severe that they sort of overtopped the banks in certain neighborhoods in East Arlington, you know, leaving some sort of things that you don't wanna see sitting on the Alewife Brook Greenway, and even making it into news media in various platforms. So with that, we saw this as an opportunity to bring this matter before the board for potential consideration as there is an opportunity to weigh in on the draft NPDES permit, which is a surface water discharge permit that the MWRA is seeking to have renewed, this is a permit that was issued 20 years ago, and while it primarily pertains to the Deer Island Treatment Facility, it also specifically pertains to a number of CSOs, and in particular MWR001, which dumps into what is known as the Little River, that's sort of the, I guess would be the head of the Alewife Brook, so given that that comment period was open, we thought perhaps the manager in collaboration with the board could consider some comments pertaining directly to that issue, which is of particular interest to the town of Arlington, and its residents, namely the Abutters, but also the folks that recreate in that area. So the period or the deadline for any entity to submit comments would be November 28th, so we have here for you this evening, Attorney Cunningham helped draft a sort of preliminary draft outline of what the board may consider for submission in the future. We do have a number of other things that we have to consider further, as at least one portion of this permit does list the town of Arlington as a co-permittee, which is a bit of a confounding factor that we're gonna be discussing further, but what I imagine is we have a little bit of discussion this evening, we get some feedback, but we bring back a more robust set of comments on November 20th for consideration, because we would still have time before the November 28th deadline. So the one thing I would add beyond the comments that were in the board's packet, is I would like to thank a number of folks representing an organization that many of you are familiar with, known as Save the Alewife Brook, were kind enough today to give me sort of an extensive tour starting over in Cambridge, and we walked the length of the stretch that's pertinent to Arlington all the way down to Somerville, and specifically identified, sort of checked in on and tried to see where exactly those CSO outfalls were. So those folks were very gracious with their time, but also they've done a significant amount of research and homework on this issue over the years, and they were kind enough to share their knowledge with me and educate me on something that I was generally aware of, but certainly was never in a position to point to exactly where these outfalls were, and who was responsible for which one. And I know during our site visit, they had already seen some of the draft comments and had taken the time to offer some feedback for consideration as we develop perhaps a more robust set of comments. So I was provided that today, and it's something that Attorney Cunningham and I can consider further, but certainly welcome the board's opinions and perspectives on this matter. So thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 730</summary>

> Mrs. Mahan. My sewage. Yes, I am Mrs. Mahan. Please don't confuse me with my twin, Mr. Diggins. We did this on purpose. I do wanna thank my colleagues in the chair, in the town manager and acting town council for this draft that we have here before us, but as well as Mr. Feeney being a relatively new town manager really has brought himself up to speed and Attorney Cunningham also. And we have a lot of, as we all know, competing interests happening in November. We have the NIPTES permit, which only comes up every 15 to 20 years. This is our opportunity and something will be granted for another 15 or 20 years. So I'm very grateful that this is something that the town manager and town council are spearheading and gathering the information, as well as I know the next MWRA hearing on the CSO with the city of Somerville and city of Cambridge is also November 28th. And I know that town council and town manager, we can have conversations with them, but previous attorney Heim has been attending all those meetings and David Morgan, the I think engineer, one of our engineers are environmental engineers. So I also wanna make sure which we are also keeping that in the loop. That's not a deadline date for the MWRA separate process with the cities of Cambridge and Somerville. That's just when the next meeting's coming up, but it's an important meeting. I know David Stauff, who's an Arlington resident, who a lot of us know, and I believe he's also an attorney, has been working on this issue for 25 years, at least now. He's sort of brought me into his sphere of trying to understand the ins and outs and legalities of it. And I know he was on the walk this morning and Kristen Anderson and others were very appreciative that the town was able to do that. So I'm not gonna say any comments because it's not on the agenda for tonight regarding the separate MWRA process, which there may be a conflict because I would ask for a future, you know, the 20th. There has been a request from the Save the Owl Wife Brook, as well as I've spoken with Jean Benson, who's the author, and somebody stop me if I should not be discussing it while the chair's here, but there's a bill that Representative Rogers filed on behalf that I'd like this board, I'll talk to the chair about including that house bill if there's been a request if the board would consider it and endorse it, but we're not doing that here tonight. My only question, knowing that you just got David Stoff's Adobe document today, and I also went through it, and most of what is in here, and this is germane to the NIPTES permit process and not the other separate process, should we include, and I'm not asking for a yes or no tonight, because everything's in here regarding NIPTES permit process and what we should be commenting on, but should we include, wouldn't say it like this, but the worst offender who only has one CSO is the city of Somerville, and under the NIPTES permit, they have been extremely negligent and have been cited and are in violation for their one CSO outfall, I don't know if it's O03, O04, but it's over by Tannery Bay, is what they call it, and they've been issued, I don't know if it's by MWRA or by the State Department of Environmental Protection, but, and they've ignored those violation notices, so not asking for an answer tonight, but if you could look into that, see if that's something that should be included with this or say, yes, that is a fact, that is the case, but that's really not germane to what, but to me, it seems like it might fall into line, that they're violating, what they're doing is they're violating currently, violating the current NIPTES permits barrier waiver, and they've been cited for that, so, and I'll have conversations privately, over the next week with the town manager and or acting town council about that, so that's the only other thing that isn't in there that may be in there, but I'll make sure my colleagues are also aware of it, thank you.

<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 124</summary>

> And I'll just ask the board administrator to make a note of Mrs. Mahan's agenda request that when we bring this back for final comments, that we also include an agenda item, I think a separate item would be appropriate, so that I as the chair can participate in this part of it, and then if the second item would be about petitioning the legislature due to my potential conflict of interest, then I could recuse myself with that discussion and have the vice chair run that part of the meeting, getting a nod from our attorney, so that's always the reaction you wanna get. Well said, Mr. Chair. Thank you, sir. All right, any further discussion or comments from the board, Mr. DiCorsi?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen DeCoursey - 312</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Feeney and Attorney Cunningham for bringing the draft forward and to Mrs. Mahan for all her work on this issue, and I'm glad, I know we have until November 28th, and I think for November 20th, I'm familiar somewhat with some of the limitations put in the draft permit, and I realize how important this is, because as Mrs. Mahan said, the last permit was issued in calendar 2000, and this could go for a long period of time, but I do think there are limitations in the permit. I'd like to see us maybe try to go into a little bit more detail what has happened since the first permit, what has changed, and where things still need to go, and try to the extent we can in the timeline, get as specific as possible in terms of what we perceive as the limitations in the draft permit here, and just if I could, Mr. Chair, so we talk about NIPTES, and we have referred to this over the years, and just for the public, NIPTES is a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, that's the permit that's granted, and what we're talking about here is whenever a municipality or an entity wishes to discharge pollutants to a surface water of the United States, they have to obtain this permit, so we're talking in one of the sections of the permit is combined sewer overflows, and that's what we're concerned about with air life, and this overall permit actually applies to the Deer Island Treatment Plant, but the CSOs are a subset of that, but I think it's very important, the more detailed we can be, I think the more they'll look at our comments, and so whatever we can do between now and November 20th, I think would be great. Thank you, sir.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Diggins - 146</summary>

> So, Mr. Dickens, thank you, so the audience for this is the EPA, who else? Mr. Avini? Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Dickens, the audience would be the EPA, who's considering the permit. All right, I understand, I mean, so just make it clear that we're writing only to them, and we're not writing to the broader public, okay? Correct. There's more that we could provide, in terms of education, but gotcha, so then, I'm fine with this, it's a comment, and we talked about violations, do you happen to know, like me, what are the, are there fines in this? I haven't read through all the permit, I'm having the hardest time just like wrapping my brain around this, I need to just, I think just kind of sit for four or five hours and read through this, but are there fines if they violate?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 315</summary>

> I'm not sure I have a definitive answer for you, Mr. Dickens. If I may, it's gonna take more than four or five hours, there's a lot of material in here, I mean, this goes back to the cleanup of the Boston Harbor, but it's very detailed. We'll get a permit, it's all right. Sorry, I just. Hey, I know that. And just to answer it quickly, yes, there are fines, but it's such a long, convoluted process, which is going through slowly, but one of the handicaps to that process is the MWRA is sort of a quasi-overseer of that, and some may say, well, they're not acting on it as quick as they should because they don't want to, and some may say they're not doing what their, their limited role is on the violations, they're doing what they have to do by law, which is receive it, keep track of it, note it, but what I would say, and I'm not usually a defender of the MWRA when it comes to combined sewage overflows into the alley, but I would give them a little bit of a pass. There is more that they could do, and I think they should, but where they are also in a linear, happening at the same time process, and have been having meetings with the cities of Somerville, Cambridge, MWRA, they're the host of it, but other communities like Arlington, Belmont, elected officials, all the way up to the State House have been attending those meetings, so that's sort of, I give them a little bit of pass for not doing everything that they could do above and beyond because they're in the middle of that. But yes, there are fines, but it's getting them enforced, and that's a whole nother, that's two more hours, and we'll talk offline. Sure. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 166</summary>

> Any further comments or discussion? Attorney Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Michael Cunningham, Acting Town Council. I just want to say that these comments from the board are extremely helpful, and from the manager, as revisions of this draft are prepared for this board's meeting on November 20th. I would also want to highlight something that the town manager said in his initial comments, which is some concern over the status of Arlington as a co-permittee in this document. I think that that'd be something that could be flushed out further in the draft, and I would request permission to include that in the future draft for this board's review. Yeah, people are nodding. Yeah, thank you for the suggestion. Sounds good to us. Okay, so I don't think we need a vote at this point. Do you have the information and advice you need, Mr. Feeney? Yes, thank you very much. Okay, that concludes item 15, and it concludes our regular business for the evening.

<details><summary>BOARD AND STAFF ANNOUNCEMENTS</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 277</summary>

> We'll now move to board and staff announcements, and this evening, I'd like to lead off with a few words that I've prepared to the public and to my colleagues. Last night, I think most of us are aware that voters of Arlington resoundingly approved a property tax override, a Prop 2 1 1 2 override, and I want to thank the voters of Arlington for doing so. The community has once again expressed its strong support for preserving our current town and school services and for making smart investments for the future. Last night's vote will not only head off some painful service cuts, but will also enable the town to raise educator pay, to be more competitive with similar districts, help our vulnerable students who are falling behind, and make additional investments in pedestrian infrastructure and trash collection. I'm also grateful that last night, the voters overwhelmingly supported question two, to provide property tax relief to the seniors who need it the most. And finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank town clerk, Julie Brazil, and her extremely hardworking office and elections team for running a smooth, user-friendly election all the way from the past few weeks of mailed ballots and early voting all the way through yesterday's work at the polls and counting the ballots late into the night. We are very grateful for their efforts. And once again, I just want to express my own personal gratitude for the public support for the town and for the schools. And with that, I will go to our board or our staff, and I think I'll start with the town manager tonight.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jim Feeney - 456</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, let me second those wonderful remarks. I know the support of the voters and the taxpayers means everything to both town and school staff. So, you know, our deepest thanks to them for their continued support and investment in their local government. The next thing I would like to say is because sort of acting town council, it doesn't seem to roll off the tongue as much. And I think a few of us have stumbled with it this evening. I am pleased to announce that as of Monday of the coming week, acting town council Mike Cunningham will become just town council Mike Cunningham. So, as you know, Attorney Cunningham has served the town admirably. I believe his three-year anniversary is maybe tomorrow. As deputy town council and then served us admirably in an acting capacity since Attorney Heim has departed and ably saw us through the special town meeting. And I am just have been most grateful for Mike's support and counsel during, you know, sort of what has been a hectic month but also just want to note how dedicated and committed Attorney Cunningham is to the community. And he takes it upon himself to attend board committee and commission meetings just to learn more about what they're doing, not necessarily because he was asked to be there for a particular agenda item. And he is one of those folks that just also loves town meeting. So, you know, another perk of, you know, knowing exactly what you're getting with this job in Arlington of, you know, there's, you know, it's a significant time commitment. And I am just very grateful that Mike was willing to step up, step forward, and put himself forward as a candidate for the permanent position. And then one other thing I would like to note in terms of a hire is we are very fortunate and pleased to announce that Colonel Philip McGovern has been appointed our new veteran services director. With that, I will note that at 11 a.m. this Saturday at the Central Fire Station located at 411 Mass Ave., we will be having our annual Veterans Day ceremony. So, I invite not only the board, but the members of the public to join us for that momentous occasion. Also, you know, perhaps meet what will now be veteran services director McGovern. But I will also note that it is my intention to bring Phil before the board at our November 20th meeting for a more public introduction. So, the, you know, members of the public have the ability to sort of put a face with the name as well and start familiarizing him with the community. So, thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eric Helmuth    - 76</summary>

> That's all right. Thank you. And just to piggyback on that, when I were in announcement mode, just for my colleagues on the board are aware that the town will be doing its usual march on Veterans Day. And we're being asked to gather at 1015 at the Walgreens parking lot for those board members who I hope will be joining me and the town manager and other officials. Attorney Cunningham, do you have any announcements?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 97</summary>

> No announcements. No remarks. I get it quickly on the remarks. I just want to say thank you to the town manager and to all those who are involved in the process. I'm really appreciative of the appointment. I've been a lawyer for over 20 years. The last three years in Arlington, by far, my favorite years as a lawyer. I've really enjoyed working for this community. I really appreciate the opportunity to be in, to serve in this capacity. Feel really lucky to be an adopted member of the Arlington community. So, thank you very much.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Diane Mahon - 898</summary>

> Ms. Barr. No announcements. Congratulations. Thanks. Mrs. Mahan. Well, I did call the town manager and town council right after. Kept them on the phone too long. Couldn't contain my enthusiasm. But I am so happy for Arlington. I know I've worked with Attorney Cunningham over the past three years, along with Attorney Heim, former town council. And even though you were just a deputy town manager, as I have said before, town council is a coach of about 12 different sports teams, or 12 different teams. And Attorney Cunningham is a very good listener, very good at interpreting and able to discern what it is and what area of the law it is. And taking the time, gathering the information for me, and always coming back with very concise and direct and to the point every time I've bothered, called him. So I am really thrilled to have him as town council, because I think it's a very difficult position to fill versus 50, 75 years ago, or even 30 years ago. It's evolved. And I want to thank the town manager for the process that he conducted. And I know you've hired the best candidate. I want to also really quickly just give, once again, and I know his name has been brought up before, recreation director Joe Connolly, who I can't tell you and I know there's times I haven't been there, but I've seen him come down on a Saturday or Sunday to events that are town related, but not necessarily Arlington recreation events. And he was once again down on a Sunday for the Danny Kelly Foundation fundraiser they had down at the rink. And he was there the whole time. I felt very guilty, because I know it's an Arlington event, and that's time away from his kids and family. But he doesn't even think twice about it, and he was there the whole time. And I know he has a lot on his plate that I've been talking to him, and we all have about Hills Hill, the artificial turf committee, can go on and on and on. He's just a wealth of knowledge and dedicated to that. And then I would, I've had just preliminary conversations with Mr. DeCorsi, but for the chair, if between you and the town manager, say between December, no later than early February, I'd like to have an agenda item regarding our town employees, their salaries. One of the things I would like to discuss is, and I've just discussed it with Mr. DeCorsi. We haven't said what our preference or decision would be. But I also would like on that agenda item we have at that night, that when we do comparable salaries for our town employees, meaning unions, there's a list of 10 communities. When we do positions, non-union, town manager, et cetera, we do the Arlington town manager 12. So I'd like an agenda item that has those two different lists and have some discussion, because I feel like there should be one, and maybe there shouldn't. Maybe there should be two separate comparable lists, but I think there should be one. And also, when the chair and the town manager thinks, and I'm not trying to inflect us into negotiations or bargaining with any of our employee units, but when we do have that, I know when I look at what's applied to union, teachers, police, public works, especially fire, that of the current 10 that they're compared to, our Arlington Public Works is the bottom. Our teachers and police are two up from the bottom, and our fire are three from the bottom. But that's, I know the chair has to work out. We have budget discussions that start mid-December and then kick in in January. But I'd like to no later than February, the first week of February, have that as an agenda item when the chair and the town manager thinks it's the best use of our time to do that. And I do want to say thank you to our chairman. 40% of the voters came out. 61% voted overwhelmingly. It was one of the most uniquely difficult campaigns that I could not compare to any other election override debt exclusion that I've been involved with in the past. There was no tried and true framework for it. There were no possible predictors. The only thing that the Invest in Arlington group that our chair was our representative on behalf of the select board that we all know could do was tell people what the work was and get it done. And it was just a very unique campaign. And I'm amazed at, when I look at the core group, Mr. Helmuth and the school committee and finance representative, as well as the parents and others that were involved, I'm amazed by what that core nucleus group, which I was, for the numbers, they were not great, but they were mighty in terms of what they got done. But then they got the word out to, you know, dozens and dozens and hundreds of other people. But a lot of work was done by that nuclear group. I'm very appreciative of it and to your families also, who I know have had to live with this since June. That's it for my announcement. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

> Thank you, Mrs. Mahad. Mr. Hurd. Thank you. Congratulations, Attorney Cunningham. Very well deserved. I've always been very impressed by your thoroughness since you've been on the job. It's funny, time flies. It's been three years. We first met you on Zoom. And then I think we met you for the first time about a year ago, and I was like, wow, you're tall. That happens in the post-COVID world. But I've certainly had a great time getting to know you. And I think in my tenure on the board, I've talked to then Attorney Heim more than I talked to any of the town managers I worked with, just because of the amount of expertise that we rely on from town council in a lot of the issues that come before us. So I certainly look forward to continuing to work with you. I do want to thank the town, or congratulate the town, I guess, and the residents, and the chair, and everyone that worked so hard on this vote. I think going into it, you call it cautious optimism, but you never really know when people get into the ballot boxes. It's a kind of funny time with the economy and whatnot. But I think there was a good message, and a good campaign, and a good job of getting out and explaining to voters why we needed it, and certainly the good that will come of it. So I was really happy to see that result. And then I, unfortunately, won't be there on Saturday for Veterans Day. So I do want to thank all of our veterans ahead of time. I'll be in Lake Placid. You could just be happy that it'll be about 20 to 30 degrees warmer here than where I am. But we'll be enjoying the sights for a hockey tournament. But I always hate to miss that each year.

> Thank you, Mr. DeCourse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, congratulations to Attorney Cunningham. And I have been impressed right from the beginning when you took over as acting town council. There were things that came up right away, and you stepped right in and did the research, gave us good advice, and worked really hard. And this is a well-earned position. So thank you, and best of luck in the position. I also want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your work as co-chair on Invest in Arlington. And your co-chairs, all the volunteers, thank the voters for Arlington for the support for the override. And it really will make a difference. And we take it very seriously how we're spending the town's money. But we certainly appreciate the support and appreciate all the work that so many volunteers did. And that leads to, as we move forward, and Mrs. Mahan and I, as you mentioned, we did speak earlier, we are going to be meeting the Long-Range Plan Committee as an advisory group to the town manager. And we're going to be advising him for the first time on November 17. That will be our next meeting. And that will take place early that day. But it'll be an opportunity to re-look at the five-year plan in light of new information that has been discussed in light of the override. And we'll start taking steps forward. And if I could, I would ask to update the board on that meeting at our November 20 meeting. The last thing I have is just with the announcement of the opening of the warrant. And there's going to be things that we'll want to put on the warrant. But one thing, and I may talk to Mr. Diggins about this in town council, is over the past year, we've had three or four things that have dealt with the MBTA right-of-way on the bikeway. And I don't know if there's anything that needs to be done through town meeting, through special legislation. But we had it with the blue bikes. I've had continuous requests from people who are concerned about a stairwell that needs to be repaired that's on the walkway from Mill Street to the bike path that is in disrepair. But because it's in the right-of-way, it hasn't been included in CPA requests. And I also had received a request, and this was from Ms. Malofchuk a few months ago, about interest in making a historical marker where the remaining railroad tracks are down by Water Street. Again, that's in the right-of-way. So I think this may be something that requires some additional time. But I'm giving a heads up to Attorney Cunningham that I may ask for some guidance if there's anything that we can do to expedite that town meeting they have to do. That's all I have. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

> Thank you. Mr. Diggins. Thank you. Hardly know where to start here. I guess I'll start with Attorney Cunningham. So congratulations, and I'm delighted that you are going to stay with us. And I have worked with Mr. Cunningham early on on the warrant article workshops. He really enjoys working with us on that, which is more proof that he really does enjoy town meeting. And are you still going to work on this? So I had you down for the 5th. Are you staying with that now? I'll be there, Mr. Diggins. OK, so then that's the announcement. It's that our third annual warrant article workshop will be on the 5th of December, probably 730 over Zoom. So thank you very much for that. And I guess, Mr. Hurte, you're going to miss our first town day 2024 meeting tomorrow? Or are you going to fall in on the road? I think I'll be at the opening ceremony, so. Oh, OK. All right. Well, just to let you all know that we're getting going on 2024. And yes, congratulations on the hard work that was put in, or the success of the hard work that was put in on the override. It was a great team. And also, I think the wide margin really kind of indicated how much our residents understand the reality of the situation. And as I said a lot, I think it's incumbent upon us to prepare people for the future. And there are two things. We can find out from people what their priorities are, what they cost, and how do we go about getting that. And there are two ways to get it, through overrides and through new growth. I think it's incumbent upon us to figure out how to do the latter and how to prepare them for the former. So that it's more a matter of course, as opposed to a big event. And I think we have it in us to do that. And I'm certainly up for doing it and look forward to preparing for the future. So thank you very much.

> Thank you. I want to add just two other things. One of them is my own chance to congratulate Attorney Cunningham. We did serve next to each other, sitting literally next to each other in town meeting. And I saw right away just how carefully you were prepared for everything that could have come up, your instant wisdom. And I thought, yeah, this guy belongs here. So I'm really glad to have you by our side. Thank you for your commitment to the town. I also wanted to just note that I had the privilege this morning of showing up at Arlington High School at 8 AM for the ribbon cutting for the new humanities wing. And along with members of the school committee, the town manager was there, the members of the high school building committee. And it is an extraordinary space that our students, high school students being what they are, they're not going to be overt in their enthusiasm. But they had their camera phones out. And they were drinking it all in. And the public will be invited to tours of the new space in January. I encourage the public to watch for that announcement, because it is a space well worth visiting. And I think that when you see it, you will be delighted at the rich learning environment and the beautiful space that we have provided for our students. So I want to add my congratulations and gratitude first to the people of Arlington for making the financial commitment to build this facility, to the school administration for its leadership and its vision, for how to build it, for the school building committee for their incredibly hard work behind the scenes to make the right decisions and to guide the town, to the town manager and his team who have been intimately involved, and to this board for their support. So it was an exciting morning. And I can't wait for this project to kind of hit into the homestretch. One more quick thing. I have jury duty on the 20th. It's our next meeting. So I may be either coming here late or may be coming in via Zoom. All right. So yeah. And it's like some town in the West. I mean, not Western, but like 20. miles or so out, so I'll be taking commuter rail, so chances are I'll be late, but I'll get here as soon as I can, you know.
