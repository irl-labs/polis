##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Before we begin, please note the following. And before I do that, I'm going to say to the crowd in the room, it's wonderful to see everybody. This is the first time in anyone's recent memory we have been this kind of standing room only. Unfortunately, our usual overflow room is not available because of the ceiling being unreliable, and we have funds in line to address that because of some water damage. However, if anyone is not comfortable standing, you're welcome to stay here. If you want, there are some chairs downstairs in the hallway outside of what is formerly the coat room and is now the ACMI control room. It's not air conditioned, but you can hear. So he's got a speaker there. So if you need to be seated, you can listen to the proceedings from that space just down the stairs from here. So regarding the hybrid format, first note that this meeting is being conducted in the select board chambers and over Zoom. It is being recorded and simultaneously broadcast on ACMI, so you're all on TV. Second, persons wishing to join the meeting by Zoom may find information on how to do so on the TOMS website. Persons participating by Zoom are reminded that you may be visible to others, so if you wish to participate, we ask you to provide your full name in the interest of developing a record of the meeting. That goes for both Zoom and in person. Third, all participants are advised that people may be listening who do not provide comment. Those persons are not required to identify themselves. Both Zoom participants and persons watching in ACMI can follow the posted agenda materials found on the TOMS website, specifically the select board agendas and minutes page. Let's see how much of the TOMS business we can get done tonight, and there is a lot of it. So let's get moving.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
As an advisory, we have an initial presentation of Mr. Tosti, if you want to take your spot there. After he makes a brief presentation for item two, I'm going to take the item for the senior item 19, senior parking permit promosal. We'll move that up and take that next, because I have a feeling that's what most of the people in this room are here for. So we'll do that afterwards. But from here, I will turn it on, turn it over to Mr. Tosti. Oh, I've never gotten to do that before. For a brief update on a really interesting and important project for the TOMS history.

##### Mr. Tosti.   
   
Thank you, members of the select board. I never realized we'd attract such a crowd to hear this presentation, but that is great. What I wanted to do was bring you up to speed on the status of the Foot of the Rocks Battlefield Memorial. I think you have received a copy of the master plan. I hope you have a chance to go through it. The first part is actually not that long. It's all the appendices that take some time. The CPA committee on community preservation granted us $50,000 about two years ago to start initial plans. We hired a landscape architect, formed a working group, and then the landscape architect came up with some plans, working group modified them as we went, came up with two presentations which are also in the appendices. We went to two public hearings and got a great deal of feedback and modified it to come up with what is sort of the semi-final plan, and nothing is cast in stone, if you'll pardon the expression. But we really want to emphasize the historic importance of this to the town of Arlington. A rather cynical Arlington historian once said that Lexington battle was a mistake, the Concord battle was a skirmish, Arlington monotony was a battle. And what was happening there was the British were retreating from Concord in disarray. They were rescued by a relief party coming out of Boston of British troops. They were reorganized, fought off the militia in Lexington, and then retreated through East Lexington, not much of an issue. In Arlington Heights, then monotony, they were confronted with 1,700 militia from 35 companies drawn up in a semicircle blocking their path back to Boston. The British had been in this war thing for a long time. They had two field pieces. They turned around their field pieces, started blazing away houses, rocks, stone walls. The militia were militia. They were just that. They weren't soldiers. They scattered. And the battle, this became the bloody mile, the battle of monotony, all the way through the Jason Russell House and to a certain degree beyond. We want to tell this story. And not just about the battlefield, but from all the feedback we've been getting, we want to broaden this out. So we're not going to just talk about the battlefield at this memorial. We're also going to be talking about the people of Arlington or monotony at that time, about 400 people. What were they about? What was the economics about? And we have two groups working on this. One focused on the Human Rights Commission, talking about the people of Arlington, the monotony, and the other talking about the battlefield itself. So we have plaques, panels along the edge. We also have an obelisk. And we've basically given them sort of carte blanche to get that going. But I also want to mention one other thing that I think should be really important to the select board. And that is the aesthetics and the safety of this area. Now, we all know the problems that we've had at the Appleton Street intersection with Mass Ave. Well, the intersection of Lowell Street and Mass Ave. is another area. Aesthetically, it is ugly. It is acres of asphalt. In addition to that, it's dangerous. Somebody crossing at the current crosswalk, which goes to the sort of the point of the foot of the rocks, has to look up and down Lowell Street, up and down Mass Ave., with people turning. They've got to look in three directions to cross one street. That is dangerous. What this plan does is take that crosswalk, move it down Lowell Street, so you're crossing Lowell Street. We only have to look in two directions. You go up the steps or on the handicapped access across, and you look in two directions again. So I think it makes a major safety improvement to the area. Now, there's another addition that I'd like the select board to think about over the next while, and that is we could make this even safer. Now, this is not tied to the foot of the rocks project, but it could be an ancillary project, which is to create a bump out, out of Lowell Street to Mass Ave. So it comes off of Lowell Street directly towards Mass Ave. Now, what this does is it forces, instead of a raceway going back and forth, it forces people coming up, cars coming up Lowell Street to make a perpendicular turn into Mass Ave., and then make a right or a left. So they have to slow down. It forces people coming up Mass Ave., who want to make a right onto Lowell Street, that they have to slow down and make a right-hand turn. So by creating this bump out as an addition, I think it could be a major safety improvement to that area, could improve the aesthetics. We could even take the horse trough, which as you all know got destroyed, not destroyed, but and take the horse trough and move it and put it right there, so the public works department only has to move 50 feet instead of two miles. So I think the foot of the rocks combined with this could create a major improvement to an aesthetically challenged area of Mass Ave., and make a great improvement to the area and improve our history. Our timetable now is we basically need to raise $900,000 between now and July 1 of next year. The timetable is, if we back up, we want to have this ready and up and running by April 19, 2025. Obviously, you know, I could do a lot of construction work over the winter, so if we start construction July 1, 2024, we could finish up by November 30 of 2024, which several people have told me is very doable. This is all an outside project. There's no houses. There's no thing like that. We could have it all done, but we have to have all the money in place. Now, to do that, we are looking at all sources. We're looking at local sources. We are looking at state sources, earmarks. We're looking at federal grants. Obviously, there's a lot of federal grants in this area, but it's not for construction, but it could be for interpretive work, panels, things like this. So the timetable is important. We need to have everything in place. I wanted to bring the select board up to speed on this as major policy makers in the town of Arlington and hopefully people in the audience. We appreciate any suggestions would be always appreciated. A checkbook would even be more appreciated. We hope to have another. We're planning to have another public hearing on a more finalized project in late September, probably even early October. And with that, I welcome any suggestions or our questions that you may have. And of course, you can always just shoot me an email or give me a call if you have any others. Thank you, Mr. Tosti. Mr. Hurd. Thank you, Mr. Tosti. Thank you for your championing of the Florida Rocks area and its connection to the town. I've been doing a lot of work with the 2025 celebration. Just last month, we went into a regional meeting with Lexington Concord and some of the surrounding areas. And it's funny to sit down to them is that we're always Lexington and Concord's little brother, little sister when it comes to historical significance. And they're a fair amount ahead of us in their planning. And it was clear to us from Arlington that we have to start thinking of creative ways to get once the 2025 celebration comes afoot to attract people from those areas to come to Arlington. And I think the Florida Rocks project, amongst our other treasures that sometimes get unnoticed, like the Jason Russell House and Schwann Mill and whatnot, is a really important cog in our plan to try to get people to Arlington for that celebration. So I'm happy to hear that's in process. And, you know, hopefully we can hit that timeline. As part of my participation, I started to reach back to my fifth grade social studies lessons and get a little more history. And as we talked in the joint meeting, we talked about the different battles of Concord and Lexington and how the bloodiest battle was right here in Arlington. And I don't know if that's something that we want to be known for, but it's certainly our history. And it's our way of, you know, participating in the celebration, which is going to be significant at the time. And we don't know who's going to come, but could be whoever the president of the United States is at that time with the vice president coming through. And we're anticipating millions of people to come to our little area. And we have a lot of planning to do. But again, I think this project will fit in very well. I think we will have to have some get creative with both permanent fixes, but I certainly anticipate, you know, if this project's done, it becomes part of our plans for that time. We could make Lowell Street one way for a short period of time, just to allow for buses and parking there. And we'll come up with safety improvements. It's going to be a work in progress. But again, I was very happy to see this coming forward. I think this is a really important project for the town in general, but specifically for the 2025 celebration. So I do appreciate your work on this. Thank you,   
   
   
##### Mr. Hurd   
   
And I'll move receipt. I don't know if I did that.   
   
##### Mr. Diggins   
   
I'll second that. And I will say I'm very excited about the additional safety element, the bump out. And I read the plan or the report last, well, when I was chair, so early in the spring. It wasn't me. The whole additional part is new. Any sense of how much it would cost? I got a, of the bump out itself, I got a rough estimate of 100,000. That's not bad. And which I thought was very doable. It takes away asphalt. It's traffic calming that whole area. Obviously, more has to be done down in Appleton Street, which I realize has other issues. But this is 100,000, approximately, that could be done in conjunction, calm the traffic, put the horse trough there, and make this whole area much more attractive and safe at the same time. Yeah. And it might be eligible for a complete street, as a complete street project. So you might want to look into that. Because right now, we're doing the prioritization of our complete streets plan. And I think this would be something that would be right up that alley. The price point is right. I'm trying to remember, I don't recall any projects in that area. But I think it could work. I mean, it may be that we haven't put any projects in that area, because it's considered part of that corridor from Appleton Street down Mass Ave. But still, if we want to get this done quickly, I think you might want to look into talking to our planning department, the senior transportation planner, about that. And you might get like half the funds from that plan. All right? And I can talk, if you couldn't hear me well, that's fine. We can talk about it later on, right? I'll talk to you. We'll get that later. No, that sounds great. Thank you.   
   
##### Mr. DeCourcey   
   
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Tosti, I'd like to thank you for all the work that you've done on this. And you really got this going a couple of years ago with the application through the CPA Committee for the funds to do this study. And I encourage everybody who has an opportunity to look at the master plan. It's on our agenda. It's also on the town's website. It is well thought out. And the public process was very impressive in terms of the comments and how the project evolved based on those comments. And the last thing I would say is I couldn't agree more on the crosswalk, moving it further down Lowell Street. It actually incorporates nicely into your plan. And the plan right now looks great, moving the boulders to the front. I learned a little bit about the horse truck, too. I always thought it was there originally. Evidently, it came from the first parish church and was moved up there at some point. So thank you for the history lesson as well. Okay. Thank you very much for your time.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Thank you. Thank you. And just to a motion receipt by Mr. Hurd and Mr. Diggins, all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? Unanimous in favor of receipt. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your service to the town and this interesting project. All right. Now, as announced previously, we will now take up item 19, the senior parking permit proposal. Would the proponents come to the table? Just introduce yourselves for the record. And yes, please. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.   
   
##### Christine Shaw   
   
Thank you, Select Board, for taking us on the agenda this evening. I'm Christine Shaw. I'm the executive director at the Council on Aging. This is Pat O'Connell. She is an awesome volunteer, a participant at the community center, and a community mobilizer tonight, I think, as shown by how wonderful the response has been. And I just wanted to start by saying thank you. I know this is a crowded room. Everybody here are just gifts to Arlington, truthfully. They are thrilled to be presenting this with me this evening and, you know, I think are really excited and motivated by having something to benefit the older adults community in Arlington on the agenda, the Select Board meeting. So it's pretty exciting for me to see everybody here. So the Council on Aging serves residents, as many of you know, in Arlington that are over age 60. Right now, we have about 12,000 residents over age 60 in Arlington. And by 2040, it's going to be closer to 14,000, which will be over 30%. It is one of the towns in Massachusetts that has the highest percentage of older adults, which I always find really interesting. And it comes up a lot in our Massachusetts Council on Aging meetings that we have. We, you know, wanted to start off the presentation with a big thank you, because we just, as many of you know, came off a big renovation at the community center. 2020 to 2022 was a huge period of time for us and involved a pandemic, which we were not expecting. But we were able to reopen last April 2022 on not the other side of the pandemic, but there were some, you know, parting clouds in the pandemic and a beautiful new community center to have programming in. It has been absolutely unbelievable to see the numbers of people that we are seeing in the community center, which is, I think, why the town supported it, why the select board supported it, and why the town made the investment in the renovation. So thank you for that. We are, I wanted to make sure people know that the community center is not a membership driven center. We, anybody can come that is, you know, over age 60 for a Council on Aging program. We don't charge any membership fees, as I said. Some of our classes have a nominal fee, and the highest we charge is three dollars for a classroom activity, and we always have scholarships available for people. I did want to share that some statistics that are pre-renovation and post-renovation. In 2020, for example, we have 700, I'm sorry, there was about 3,400 walk-in social work appointments that we received throughout the year. This year, as of June 8th, and these are fiscal year numbers, so they're about three weeks short of a full year, we have about 4,100, so it's 700 new people that came this year, as opposed to pre-renovation. Our transportation program, many of you are familiar with, is partially funded by CDBG funding. We have about 1,600 additional rides. We have 8,779 as of June 8th, as opposed to about 7,000 before the renovation. And one number that is why there's so many people here and so many people in the community center, it really helps show that, is that there was about just over 1,000 events and programs that happened in the center. And this year, as of June 8th, we had 4,420. That is mostly because of the amount of space that we have. We have a lot more rooms we can do things with. We're programming many different rooms at one time before we had to, we were pretty limited due to being able to here in the rooms that were closed off. So we've served about 1,400 more unique individuals so far this year. So for just under 4,000 unique Arlington residents were served by June 8th of this year. I did include in the presentation too, two pages of just pictures and slides from some of the programs we've had. And that was mostly just to show the sheer numbers of people enjoying the community center. A lot of our programs have waiting lists and then we are extending to additional sessions of programs because the demand is so high, which is great. And that's again, why we had the renovation. It's we want people to be coming. We want them to be engaged and a part of their community in their older years. So the reason we are here tonight is, as we know, parking was a challenge before. Given the numbers that I shared, it's an even bigger issue now. But I wanted to share some of the things that we've done to try to help with this issue during the past, especially few years of frustrations with parking. We first made all rides on the council on aging vans free of charge to and from the community center to try to encourage more people to take the van. They do and the vans are packed full every day, but they absolutely are free of charge. And we encourage people as many, many people that tend to do that. We've also hired two additional van drivers so that there can be two vans on the road at all times. We of course encourage carpooling and many of the residents participate in carpooling. We continue to partner with the local taxi company, Arbel Taxi to offer discount taxi vouchers or free taxi vouchers. We hold ride share training on services like Uber and Lyft. We do MBTA senior Charlie cards, really anything can do to decrease the number of individual cars coming to the center, we really try. But many people for a variety of reasons do want the independents to be able to drive to the center, park and come in if they need to. So that is why we are again here this evening. This is something we've been talking about for a few years with the residents that come in and on the COA board. And we had Pat here who mobilized a group of residents to help explore the options because like I said, we have really tried pretty hard to exhaust some things to take the sting out of how hard it is to park. And then this in 2022, Pat found a group of residents and peers to explore some of the options. They presented some of the options that they found to the Council on Aging board in March of this year. And that is how we are here today since that. They learned a lot about the programs in surrounding towns and we've done a lot of research talking to those Councils on Aging and towns on how their programs are run. And Pat is now here to present some of what she found. Here to you.   
   
##### Pat O'Connell   
   
My name is Pat O'Connell and I have been a resident of Arlington for 59 years. I am representing many Arlington seniors who have asked the Council on Aging board at their past March 23rd meeting to propose to the town. And now we are asking the town to accept and approve the proposal for senior parking stickers. Many of the surrounding towns listed on the following page, which I hope you all received, have given their seniors stickers. I may tell you that it's Belmont, Winchester, Newton, Medford, Watertown, and Lexington. And many of those towns have a big senior parking area. Why do we deserve such a privilege? As Lexington stated, and I was quite impressed with their comment, the general purpose of the program is an act of goodwill for our seniors. Something we can do for them without any negative ramifications and without much cost at all. We want our seniors to feel respected and appreciated in the town. We have supported the town for many years. Like I said, I've been here 59. This is my second high school. All the new schools have been in the town. It's not just the schools we're paying for. I'm very happy with the town. I don't complain about the school money. I know the town is only as good as your schools. We have supported the new schools, and yet we have no students in these classes. We're all in our late 60s, 70, 80, and even older. We have good size homes. However, should we sell those homes, it would more than increase the school budget because there'd be more children going to the school. We have educated our children here, and many have become productive adults, giving the town a very good name. When you go around and you hear, oh, you're from Arlington, I'm very proud to say, yes, I am. These are a few reasons why we would ask you to implement the senior parking tickets, which the COA would issue. Then we could park on Mass Ave. and walk up to the center. Then our time would not be watching a clock so to avoid a parking violation ticket. We see many seniors getting tickets. I can think of five. While we're in a program, you're paying, yes, a nominal fee to keep the fees down with your income, and you go out and you got a $15 ticket. Senior years should be easy years without watching a time clock, and our motto now in the senior center is we earned it. I would like to thank all the people who work with me, the many seniors on the project so it could be brought before you tonight. Lee, Elaine, Jane, Mary, Marie, and so many others who helped passing out the flyers. My thanks also go to Michael Quinn, chairman of the COA board, Stephen DeCoursey, the representative for a few people to the COA board, and of course, Christine Cha, the executive director of the COA. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,   
   
##### Mr. Decoursey   
   
Pat. I appreciate that, and it really kinda needs to be underscored how much work and coordination went into this by Pat and the group, and also the group that's here in the room and in the hall and downstairs tonight. So Pat mentioned, like you saw on your materials, the additional towns who do have senior parking sticker programs, as Pat called them, and I'm happy to answer questions about those. There was kind of a snapshot of them in your packet. But right now, I wanted to go into exactly kind of what we're thinking or what we're proposing for a parking permit or a parking sticker program. And then we can go from there. But as Pat mentioned, the program could be managed and implemented by the Council on Aging department. We're proposing a pilot program, a two-year pilot. And in that program, interested residents who are age 60 plus would need to visit the Council on Aging either during designated hours or applying by mail or online. Various other towns had success with different models, and we would look into that. We would be limiting to one sticker per address, and they would need to provide proof of address, age, and vehicle registration. We would be not charging to receive the sticker. And the Council on Aging would be managing the database and renewal process. Vehicles that have this sticker affixed, so not a hang tag, but a sticker affixed to the car, would receive the following benefits. Not being charged while parked at metered spots or in municipal lots within Arlington. Not being ticketed for exceeding time limits along Maple Street and Academy Street, as long as the vehicles were legally parked otherwise, of course. And this is the piece that assists with the parking around the community center, and when Pat mentions the tickets that people are getting, are usually on those streets. The parking stickers would not allow for overnight parking in any situation, and they would need to be affixed to one vehicle and not shared between family members or people within the same house. People participating in the program would need to sign a document agreeing to the terms and conditions of the program and outlying restrictions, which we would do as we registered individual people for the program. I also just wanted to mention some considerations that went into the proposal and kind of the thoughts through this process and speaking with other towns. We recognize that the program will certainly not solve all the parking issues at the Council on Aging and the community center and 27 Maple Street or the center of Arlington. But as Pat so nicely read that quote from the Lexington representative when they were advocating for their program, that it's really an act of goodwill and something that we can do for our older adults without negative ramifications, not asking them for anything in return and giving them a benefit. We also recognize that training for parking enforcers would be necessary and our COA staff would be happy to lead or assist with those efforts. And I've spoken with Corey Rito at the police about how this might work. Also, I wanted to mention that, and I'm sure you're not surprised to hear, really the lack of parking is a main reason that people give us when we say, why did you stop coming or why haven't you come? And the center of Arlington's hard to park in. We all know that it's not something people don't realize, but really the older adults who are spending time socializing and participating in our programs are engaged with their community. And many say that they come every day, no matter what, because it helps with their mental health. And what we learned over the pandemic, and we knew this before, but it became even more exemplified is that social isolation is detrimental to people at all ages. And as people age, staying involved with their community, coming to a place like the community center to participate is really important. So we want to try to deter any barriers from keeping people from coming. Also, I wanted to make sure to note that the residents that we serve, and I don't always know if this is as apparent as it should be, many, most are on fixed incomes, but more than half are on a low to moderate income range. Unfortunately, every week we have people who get a $15 or so parking ticket, which doesn't sound like much to some people. And I completely understand the rationale of, well, if you're coming for a free program, you get a $15 ticket, it's still only $15, which is cheaper than a gym membership. But it's really unaffordable to the people we serve. And it's just a financial piece that a lot of people don't truly understand. I also wanted to mention that we are limiting to one sticker per address because we completely acknowledge that driving personal vehicles is not the way of the future. But we want older adults who really seek the independence to be able to make a choice to drive if it works better for them to be able to make that choice if they would like. And just really in closing to say, Arlington invested in the renovation so that it could be, the center could be used. And a key piece of dealing with keeping our older adults in Arlington and everywhere engaged and avoiding social isolation is really important. And that's really my main reason for putting the proposal out there. I also briefly wanted to ask Michael Quinn, who Pat mentioned. He's our Council on Aging board chair. For those of you who aren't aware, just to come up and say a couple words. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.   
   
##### Mr. Quinn   
   
Good evening, Mr. Quinn. Hi, good evening. Michael Quinn, 15 Chaney Road Precinct 10. I am the chair of the advisory board to the Council on Aging. And we view our role as trying to support Arlington Seniors in any way possible. That's just for broadcast. That's for ACB. I think if everybody, if we can kind of keep the conversation down, that'll help people in the back of the room hear what's being said. I got a teacher's voice. I can speak a whole lot louder. We view our role in the advisory board as supporting Arlington Seniors and working with the Council on Aging. And I've been on the board now, I think this is my sixth year. This is one of the really great proposals that has come to us. It did not come from our board. It came from Pat and the people with Pat who had looked around at the other towns. In March at our meeting when they brought this forward, we just thought, can we implement this tomorrow? This is just such a wonderful proposal. In terms of all the details of it, I think that Pat and Christine really covered it all quite well. The only thing I would want to add to that is the sooner we can get this implemented, the better. And if after review of having the program in place for a while, there was some way to expand it or improve it or make it better, I would hope you would give that due and fair consideration. That's all I've got. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the excellent presentation. I will now turn to the members of the board. I think we'll start with our liaison to the Council on Aging. Mr. DiCorsi.   
   
##### Mr. DeCoursey   
   
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want to thank everybody for coming this evening and showing your support for this program. I have to say for myself, I was convinced on March 23rd when Pat made the presentation to the Council on Aging Board but I think it's a wonderful program. I think it really truly would be an act of goodwill to support this. I have a few other comments, but I also want to recognize all the members of the Council on Aging who are here this evening and thank them for coming. So Mary is here, Michael's here, Nancy, I believe, is here as well. Might be a few others. And I have truly enjoyed being the liaison to the advisory board to the Council on Aging. And as far as this project is concerned, I was really impressed with the amount of homework that was done in looking at the other. I believe that I want to thank the people who worked on it. And it just made a lot of sense to me to really go forward with this. The one thing that I did see from other communities and hopefully we can talk about this among other members is nearly every other community does this program for age 65 and above. I know a few of you serve age 60 and above. And as a person, if we do a two-year pilot who actually would be within the pilot group before the end of the period, maybe 65 might be for consistency with the other communities. There's nothing else. I'm fully happy to support the whole thing. But the other aspects of it make perfect sense to me. Parking throughout the town, not just around the community center. I had a few questions early on about Maple and Academy Streets because it was concerned. If you're in a program and you run late, you don't want that ticket if you go past that four hours. We want to encourage people to come to the community center. I do note that Newton, for example, has a program on a side street near their senior center where they allow for permit parking throughout the day. So I'm going to move approval of the proposal with the only caveat. I think 65 or over may be for consistency that the right way to go for now. But if we see that there's more demand, certainly willing to expand that. But a two-year pilot makes perfect sense. Ms. Schacht has been very gracious in terms of agreeing to implement the program through the Council on Aging, working with the Treasurer's, well, not even with the Treasurer's Office, working with the town to get people signed up. I don't think that some communities charge for the sticker. I don't think we should be doing that here. So I agree with the period of time you receive a sticker for no charge. So on that basis, I move approval. approval. I will definitely second that, and I agree with not charging for this, as well as the two-year pilot and exploring beyond that. Thanks to everybody who's worked on this. I would just ask, and I know you've had conversations with Officer Corey Rattoe, so I'm sure you all have already discussed this, that you have sort of a uniform or an agreed-upon spot for where those stickers that have to be affixed go, just for traffic enforcement, and that it has to be affixed and not on a placard or a cardboard or anything like that. And then the other thing that I'd like to know, just for information's sake, not for criticism or wanting to oversee it, but when you all think it's appropriate, six, nine, or even 12 months, but maybe six or nine months, just sort of a report back to the Board of, you know, how many stickers went out, you know, what the policies are in terms of, you know, where it should be, as well as maybe, again, if either the nine- or the 12-month process, or 12-month and 24, some ideas that I know you all probably have already started talking about at the community center and at Gale-Ann's and everywhere else that I see you all about opportunities to expand this program. Just so the Board can know, as an FYI, or maybe more appropriately through our liaison, Mr. DeCoursey, he can bring that back to the Board, because we're going to talk about parking later on tonight, and not your parking, a different parking, and one of the things for me is I totally get that, you know, a dollar is five dimes and ten nickels, you know. My parents never owned a home. I knew exactly, we had put it on the tab in most of the small stores here in Arlington. I know the block of cheese that they won't cut for you, which is really embarrassing trying to cut that. So, I totally get what a $15 ticket means, and God forbid you get two. I mean, that's probably six to 12 months of your extra spending right there, and it really is. Sometimes when I tell people that story, I think they think I'm exaggerating, but it's not. So, we'll gladly second Mr. DeCoursey's motion. I'd like to start it also at 65 and up. Would like that sort of mini-report, just so the Board knows, in terms of where you decide with the Police Department and with the Council on Aging where it will be affixed, and I like that you're saying one sticker per household, because the Board is really trying to, you know, look to the future, alternative modes of transportation, but I know, certainly for the community center, it turns into a job sometimes when you try to find versus getting in your own car, getting down to the appointment that you need. So, thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Garcia, certainly. Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and my excitement to move approval. One other thing I didn't mention, and I talked to Ms. Schar about this in terms of an implementation date, and we had talked about a date no later than September 1st to implement this, take a little time to develop the application process and just administering things, but I think we discussed that that we thought was a doable date, so just so the Board knows that.   
   
##### Mr. Diggins   
   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, yes, I support this, although I was fine with 60, and so then I have a question. Why was 60 chosen as a number?  And would you? Yeah, anybody who's hanging out there can come in with other questions, yeah. Just to move the microphone over to you. All of our programs through the Council on Aging are for adults age 60 and above. We do have a program for income tax prep through the AARP, and that is age 65 and above, that is the AARP age, but all of the Councils on Aging are 60 or above, and in Arlington, our offices, our programs are available for 60 and above, so that's why it was just for consistency. I knew there was some rationale behind it, and if you could state it, it would be great, you know, so, and I will note that this was part of the age-friendly, dementia-friendly plan, and along with that was a recommendation for spots that are devoted only to seniors in that area. Are we doing that now? Yes, this is, you know, this is an effort towards that, yes. We do have our lot that is for the entire, you know, building and neighborhood behind our building, but the spots aren't necessarily designated for seniors only. This is, you know, really in an effort to make some senior parking available. All right, so that's a possible next step. Okay, great. So, how much carpooling goes on now with people coming to the Center? I think a decent amount. We have a lot of our programs that are on the bigger side are in the first half of the day, and I do know a lot of the seniors that come for a 9 a.m. exercise class and another one that's at 11 a.m., many of them park in, you know, their neighborhood side streets and then will take one car. A lot of people will, you know, say, I'll pick you up on this street, and truly because they want to, but also because they have to, and by the time they get there, there probably is only one or two spots left. So, a decent amount, I would say, and I always hear it being discussed, so. Here's a little geeky, you know, transportation, transit question. Do they ever carpool and then take the van? In one visit? Yeah, yeah, like a bunch of them get together at a location and then they get, because that might make the van more efficient. We've talked about that before, the thought of having kind of van-bus stops type, and we have so far been able to pick up everybody at their individual homes on the van, but it has been discussed, and it would absolutely be possible, and there are some times, I guess, now that I'm thinking about it, that the van will stop at one address and pick up two people. So, yeah. Yeah. Because, I mean, right now the MPO is working on its coordinated human transit, you know, and transportation plan, and I think any things along those lines, I mean, like ideas, I mean, that could make that work better, I mean, and certainly they are in favor of doing pilots, I mean, and so you might be able to find some funding, I mean, for creative ideas for helping to get people who need, you know, transit, especially elderly people who need transit around. Just a couple more short questions, you know, and so you mentioned that it's hard to park in Arlington now, in the center now. How is this going to help with that? So, you know, I think what it's going to do is help the seniors that are in Arlington park without having a fee, and then park in the streets around the community center without the time restriction that they're getting parking tickets for. I think that we can't build a parking lot to create more parking, and that's usually what I tell people when they come in and say, this is awful, the parking's terrible, and I say, we're trying to get creative because we can't build a parking lot anywhere around here that I can see. If anybody has an idea, we'd love to hear it, but we have to get creative in how to address the parking issues, so I think this is really our creative way of trying to do the best we can when we can't make more parking spaces magically appear. I don't think it solves all the parking. And this is my Heineken way, but I can't, you know, so I'm kind of interested in what are some of these other ideas that you're thinking about, you know? I mean, I know we've talked about maybe the dedicated spots, but you said that this pilot meeting could lead to some other ideas, that part of the pilot is to perhaps give you some other ideas? It could, yeah, no, I definitely think it could, and we're, you know, discussing with other towns on what they're doing through their senior parking sticker projects, and I think what we'll see over the one or two years that we're trying this out is what actually happens and how many, you know, people are now going to park on Maple and Academy that might have been parking elsewhere because they won't get a ticket, and just really the domino effect of what we can learn from this is I think what will create those new opportunities and new ideas. I don't have anything really new or exciting at this point, but I think that it could probably come out, and like you said, we're constantly applying for grants, we're constantly trying to rework how we're using the vans, we have the whole ride share platforms now, and we're always looking for different accessible transportation options. The accessibility piece is huge, there's not that many accessible transportation options outside of our vans, truthfully, and the MBTA ride, so that is a piece that I would love to focus on next, and before the pandemic, Uber was doing a great job with wheelchair accessible vehicles, but now there's almost none that I've seen recently, so just kind of looking for ways to expand on that and just constantly offer more transportation because it's necessary, for sure. All right, thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.   
   
##### Mrs. Mahon   
   
Mr. Diggins did you have anything to share? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you for the presentation, this is very exciting. My question, which your answer from Mr. Diggins in comment was similar, is that, I mean, there's two ways I look at this. One, the meter is in Arlington Centre, and one, the parking on Maple Street, and it seemed to me that the age 60 was directly related to the fact that the programs are 60 plus. So I'll go with what the majority of the board wants to do, but I'm also fine with 60 because I think to some extent, because it's not just over on Maple Street and Academy Street, that's not a revenue issue, it's not parking meters, it's a time issue, and to say that some participants in the program can park there unlimited, if you have four-hour or six-hour programs, and some can't, I think is a little inequitable, I would say as far as parking in the centre, and I'm actually not going to be in this time frame during the pilot, I've got a few more years to go. But I think from that perspective, you say, yeah, you know, I think 65 is a good day for the meters, but I think to cut in with the multiple stickers would be difficult in enforcement. So again, I will go with whatever, vote yes on whatever the majority of the board puts forth as a motion, but I'm also fine with 60 just because of, for that reason, I think it creates a little more equity in the programs that are being offered, whereas it sounds like a lot of the rationale here, we hear a lot more about the community centre than Arlington Centre and the parking to make it a little more accessible for people. So that said, I mean, again, I think this is an amazing program. When we first implemented the meters in Arlington Centre, the purpose was to create parking because a lot of people from the businesses were parking in these spots. But, you know, I think it's very important to make it easy for seniors to use our businesses in Arlington Centre, and a lot of people drive by if you can't find convenient parking. In some of the municipalities that have done this, do they have, I know you mentioned senior only parking spaces, like, I've had a lot of conversations with people where I've said you can't magically create parking, it's just not there in Arlington, but if we were to say in Broadway Plaza, take two or three spaces and list senior permit parking only, I mean, are any programs, if you're aware of it, do any municipalities use those methods? I think that is a really great idea, but I don't think that they have had specifically designated senior parking spaces because in most of these towns around their senior centre or community centre, they have huge parking lots. So, it's interesting because their parking permit program is more, like we heard from Lexington, a token of appreciation for the seniors. The Lexington Community Centre, if you've been there, has more parking than all of Arlington put together. So, I think that unique senior parking spaces haven't been as necessary in those towns, but I could look to see if in communities that are, you know, have more metres or less parking overall, maybe like a Somerville or if they have, I haven't heard, but I think it's really interesting and could only benefit. I don't want to create more work for you. I think that's something that we can take on if we vote the permit, the program through as I'm just kind of spitballing ideas. If we have a pilot, you could create a couple spots. You could designate areas in Arlington Centre where we're not getting metre revenue anyways, so you get, designate those spots, maybe around the community centre, senior sticker parking only from, you know, 9am to 5pm, which maybe is when you have most of your, I don't know when your programs are, but then, you know, when a town meeting, maybe those spots back for when the town hall gets. So, I think this idea, once we implement the program, then we can kind of spitball some ideas how to improve the program. We don't have to wait until the end in order to do that. But I think it's a great idea. I think it is very well deserved, and I thank you for the presentation. Thank you to everyone that worked on this. Ms. O'Connor, during your presentation, I kept looking, and you shined very brightly on the ACMI feed with your wonderful green jacket. We all look very dull behind you. Yes. It's not weird. It works, but again, happy to support this, and I think it's well deserved, and I look forward to the results. Thank you. Thank you. Just a quick question for Ms. Shah. Do you know off the top of your head, of the 30 to 971 unique individuals served, approximately how many of them are 60 to 65? I don't have that number. I know about 3,100 of the total age, 3,100 people are between 60 to 65. So I think it's of the 11,000, where is it? Yeah, of the 11,000, 200, 3,000 of them, so it's a decent sized amount. I can say that most people start utilizing our programs and services more in their later 60s, but we have lots of people that come that are 60 on the dot. So there would absolutely be people that we would have to explain that this is something that is for 65 and up. For the people who are coming in the 60 or early 60s, do they tend to be people who are taking early Social Security retirement? Are they still working?  What sense do you have, retired versus not? Most of the people that are coming for most of our programs have stopped working, but we are starting to add on a lot more programs Thursday evenings, later in the day, so that people can come from work. We do have people that work a couple days a week and come the opposite days, but most of the crunch time for our programs are people that are no longer going to work every day, for sure. Good. So I think I love this program. I was a yes coming in, and I'm a yes now. So I think I'll support this, too. And I like Mr. DeCourcey's motion. I would suggest that maybe we give this a little more thought and maybe do some further conversation. I'd be open to a brief item on one of our next summer meetings if we wanted to consider lowering down to 60, and maybe you and I can talk, too, offline, just a little more consideration to make sure we get that right.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
So any further discussion for the board? So on a motion by Mr. Diggins to approve with a date no later than September 1st and Mr. DeCourcey. Now it's my turn to do it. I was going to say, there's something about that end. Thank you. That's right. And a second by Mrs. Mahon. So it's to approve the program with age 65 and starting no later than September 1st. And a two-year pilot. And a two-year pilot and everything else as is in the document. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. Thank you all. Everybody on the board, I appreciate it. Thank you for the time. And I'll give a moment for people to move around. We are going to move on with our agenda. So if you are planning to leave after this item, please do. And we'll continue on with our business. How are you? We are still in business, sir. So we will move on. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, sure. No, you're welcome to stay. We're going to take about a two-minute recess in time for people to move around. So a two-minute recess, John.

<details><summary>Farmers Market Banners   
   
We're back in session. Thank you.  And I mean that truly, that was wonderful. We now have item three for approval, Arlington Farmers Market Banners. Patsy. Yes. Chair of the hot seat. Yes. Substituting for Andy Doan, who's the director of Arlington Eats, who's in Iowa on a family vacation. Just introduce yourself for the record.   
   
##### Patsy Kramer   
   
Yeah, Patsy Kramer. I'm the onsite manager for the farmers market. I think as many of you know, we merged the farmers market with Arlington Eats this past year. And the request for the banners is just given that it's a new entity and a new owner, basically, of the farmers market, a new logo, and wanted to take the opportunity to just spread the word that it's still there, still functioning, still doing a good job. So that's what our request is. Wonderful. Thank you very much. Any comments from the board? Move approval. Second. Second. And they look great. Thank you. Any discussion? For the motion of approval by Mr. Herb, seconded by Mr. Diggins. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Aye. Opposed?  Unanimous. Thank you very much. Come to the market. Yeah, we look forward to that. Okay, bye.

<details><summary>Art in the Park   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Item four, we have Art in the Park, July 15th, 2023 at Whittemore Park. And Chuck Luca from the Dahl Museum. Mr. Luca, are you here in person or on Zoom? If you're on Zoom, you'd raise your hand. Here? I'm not seeing him. I don't see the presentation. I would entertain the discussion from our... I was going to ask you, Mr. Chair, is the application blank for everybody? Yeah, I was just going to say that. I know, I just didn't know if it was just me. Since this is, when is our next meeting? 17th. So, which is after this. I would ask the Chair, Attorney Heim, how to handle this, if we should approve it subject to receiving the actual application, where it's July 15th. What, Mr. Chair? Should have heard Mr. Vice Chair, do you have anything? I'm sorry, I don't want to step into your requests for clarification. I would just say, I would be comfortable moving approval and shifting it to the Chair to use his discretion to make sure everything's done safely and appropriately for the area. Attorney Heim, would you be comfortable with that? I think, yes, I think the appropriate motion would be along those lines, would be, you know, move that the application being understood to be X is approved subject to conditions appropriately set forth by the Chair and Town Departments. Is that your motion? Yes. Sounded better than mine. I guess I'll second it. I thought that was my motion, that can we approve this subject to getting the particular. So, I'll second Mr. Hurd's motion. No, no, no, I gotta be more clear. All right, discussion from the Board? Just make sure they look good. Just make sure they look good. Yes. Okay, that's all, that's all. Thank you. Okay, so on a motion from Mrs. Mahon, a seconded by Mr. Hurd, all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. So, Ms. Mara, we can work together on getting the final, fixing that technical glitch.

<details><summary>Appointments   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Next, we have item 12, appointments for the Disability Commission. And I apologize in advance if I get the pronunciation wrong. Carrie's to support us. And I believe that, yep. We are, Carrie's coming, there we go, to, on Zoom. And Ms. Murray, can you do anything with the display?  I don't know if you have control over that, too. There we go. So, good evening. And please correct my pronunciation of your name and introduce yourself to the board. And tell us a little bit why you're interested in serving on the Disability Commission. And go ahead and unmute yourself. I wasn't sure if you called me first. I just joined, so I couldn't hear. Yes, yes, I did. I probably mangled your last name. So please correct me by introducing yourself and saying it properly.   
   
##### Carrie Sasportis   
   
Sure, hi, I'm Carrie Sasportis. And I'd like to join the Disability Commission because I really feel strongly that I could add a perspective of lived experience of living with a disability to the Disability Commission. And I'm interested in advancing some of the issues around town systems and policies in relation to the ADA transition plan that are non-capital expenses. And so I really feel like I could provide some insight there. And just in general, I wanna continue to be civically active in the town. I'm also a commissioner on the LGBTQIA plus Rainbow Commission.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Terrific, thank you. I'll now turn to the board. Mr. Diggins. I'll make a motion to approve our appointment. And as a liaison to the Rainbow Commission, I have worked with Carrie and she's great. And so I'm sure she'll do great work with the Disability Commission. Terrific, any other questions?  Second. Thank you. Wonderful. And I think while we're here, we'll take our, well, let's go ahead and take our vote and then we'll speak with Ms. Gagentauber. But I wanna say thank you for being willing to serve. Thank you for your service in the Rainbow Commission and signing up for more work is the sign of real dedication, but we appreciate your love for the community. And we're very lucky to have you serving in the Disability Commission. So on a motion to approve by Mr. Diggins or seconded by Mrs. Mahon, all in favor say aye. Aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. Welcome.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Now let's turn to Janice Kagan-Teuber. Was appointed on June the 5th because I vouched for you and I said how wonderful you were to work with and work together over many months on the Remote Participation Task Force. And I specifically spoke, Janice, for how well you represented the disability community's needs and perspectives as we considered that really important topic. So tonight we asked you just to come back. I know you couldn't make the last meeting, but we asked you to come back and just say hello and introduce yourself and say a few words about how you plan to serve on the Disability Commission.   
   
##### Janice Kagan-Teuber   
   
Thank you. It's a little difficult to hear you, Eric, as well as some of the other people. Mr. Diggins, very difficult to hear you, too. You're so far away. My name is Janice Gagentauber. Not tuber. Thank you. If you think about Sigmund Freud and how he spelled his name, it's F-R-E-U-D. And the last half of my last name is T-E-U-B-E-R. So trying to make that connection. Anyway, my first foray into working for the town was with the Remote Study Committee. And that was quite eye-opening. But before that, I started going to the Disability Commission meetings. I think I started in early 2020. I had recently retired, and I wanted to become more involved in the town. I've lived here since 1981 and knew virtually nothing about how the town functioned. So I wanted to get involved. And given my background as a former teacher of deafblind children, a certified American Sign Language interpreter, an evaluator of American Sign Language interpreters, I thought the Disability Commission would be the best fit for me. And I have enjoyed working with the members of the commission since I started attending and am very pleased and grateful that you all have approved my membership. Thank you very much.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
It's wonderful to get to know you a little bit and give the public a chance to know how lucky they are to have you serving on the Disability Commission. Any questions or comments from my colleagues?  Thank you, Ms. Kagan-Teuber. Thank you very much. Have a good evening. And have a wonderful rest of your meeting. Thank you. Have a good evening. Bye. That takes us to item 13, the Clean Energy Future Committee appointments. That would be Amy Graber. See if Amy is present on Zoom. There we go. Good evening. Good evening. Take a couple of minutes to introduce yourself and tell us about your interest in serving.   
   
##### Amy Graber   
   
Hi, I am, excuse me. I am Amy Graber. I am hoping to be part of the Clean Energy Future Committee for the town of Arlington. I am passionate about sustainability and I previously worked for a mass-save contractor in Massachusetts in the marketing department. So I hope to also bring those skills to the committee. I am very passionate about outreach and would like to be part of that outreach for the committee in the community that I am now living in and also advocate for electrification within the town of Arlington and transportation.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Thank you. I will say as a select board representative member to that committee, I think you'll fit right in with those passions and interests. Entertain any discussion or motions from the board. Mr. Diggins. I'll make a motion to approve her appointment. And I have to say what captured me was the fact that you found out about the commission. I'll turn on my camera so I can talk to you. I found out about the commission by roaming through the town's website. Very cool. Thank you. Second. Second from Mr. Hurd. Any further discussion?  Oh, I think you'll be terrific. And it's delightful to have somebody new, as Mr. Diggins said, who just looked for opportunities to serve. And that is what makes Arlington such a wonderful community is that people are willing to step up and do the work. And I look forward to seeing you on those Friday morning meetings. On a motion by Mr. Diggins and seconded by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say, and this is a motion for appointment. Please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. Welcome and thank you. Thank you.

<details><summary>Licenses and Permits   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
That takes us to item 14. Licensing under licenses and permits. We have for approval a class two license from Arzumanian Real Motors, incorporated for Dudley Street Place.   
   
##### David Arzumanian   
   
Good evening, gentlemen. Good evening. Thank you for your patience this evening. My name is David Arzumanian. I apologize, Arson Arzumanian is missing today due to an emergency, personal emergency. Today I'm here to receive your permission for our new business name for Dudley Street Place. We're planning to do the same business as before, selling used cars. I used to work with Edward there from the very beginning. And today I'm just looking to receive your permission for the new business name.   
   
##### Mrs. Mahon.   
   
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I have a tickle. I'd like to move approval subject to all conditions, contained hearing, which I know you're aware of those, just from the building department, but there are no objections from any of the departments. Second. Any further discussion? A motion of approval by Mrs. Mahon, seconded by Mr. DeCourcey. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is unanimous. Thank you so much. Good luck with your business. Thank you. Thank you again for your patience tonight.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
That brings us to item 15 for approval, common vitular license for Tate Bakery and Cafe. We have Christopher Henao. Might be, it's Bob Innesi. Oh, and Mr. Innesi, I think it might be the, Mr. Robert Innesi is on Zoom, as my vice chair's suggesting, may be representing the applicant. So I could promote him to panelist, so he can. Zoom not responding for you either, Ms. Maher. So I've asked to promote, I'm not sure if he has to accept it. There we go. This has declined to be promoted as a panelist. Probably hit the wrong button. Maybe, I'll try again. And if, so if anybody on Zoom is here to speak to this, to the Tate license, if you'd raise your hand. Okay, we have Mr. Boyle, yeah, all right. Still working out the kinks in this whole hybrid thing. All right, and Robert Boyle should be able to, there we go, unmute. Good evening, sir.   
   
##### Mr. Anesee   
   
Hey, good evening, everybody. So are you here to speak to the Tate license application? I am, we're having trouble getting Bob into the meeting. Yeah, let's try it. So Mr. Innesi is on your team as well? He is, he's representing Tate, no matter. I could speak to it if we can't get him in. All right, yeah, so Ms. Martin, if you could try again to promote Bob to panelist. Mr. Boyle, do you have anybody else on your team that we should be bringing in? Christian Henao should be in the room as well. He's there. He's the applicant. He's the operator manager of the cafe. All right, so let's see if we can bring in Mr. Henao as well. Yep, there we go. I'm hearing that Mr. Innesi is declining. So do you have a, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so Tate Bakery and Cafe, we are a restaurant brand. We have been under construction at 645 Mass Avenue, converting the former restaurant there, I'm not sure if it shows, to a Tate Bakery and Cafe. Tate is a breakfast, lunch, and dinner establishment. We operate seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. No alcohol. We have 111 seats inside of the restaurant, and we hope to be approved for an additional seven on a parallel path, not subject to this matter here, but for a patio. And we're about three weeks out from when we hope to achieve certificate of occupancy. Another two weeks for training. And we hope to open the establishment on August 2nd. Thank you. And did you want anybody else from your team to make remarks before the board has questions and comments? I don't think so, we can take your questions. Okay, I will turn to the board for discussion, questions, or motions.   
   
##### Mr. Hurd   
   
A move of approval. I think there's a lot of people in town that are very excited about this. Tate certainly has a good name in the Boston area, and so we'll, you're joining a long list of many very successful and well-loved coffee shops in Arlington, but I spent a lot of time in Arlington Center, so I'll find my way down to Tate as soon as it opens. I think there's a tartine with your name on it, Mr. Hurd. I think there was a modern family where he said, I'm not poutine, that in my mouth, so. I'm more of a bacon, egg, and cheese guy. Me too. They're B-A-L-T, it's not, you can't, I'm sure if she said no avocado, you would get a B-L-T, but anyways.   
   
##### Mr. Diggins   
   
Mr. Diggins had his hand raised. Yeah, I'll happily second that, and I'm glad to remain the restaurant, you know, so yes. Yeah, I am too. Any further discussion or questions for the applicants? Yeah, we are delighted that this is happening, and as Mr. Diggins said, I'm glad that we were able to retain that space as a restaurant, and that's something that, I think the demand for coffee shops and gathering places like that is far from being met in Arlington, so we really welcome this, and wish you the best of success.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
So on a motion for approval subject to conditions by Mr. Hurd, and seconded by Mr. Diggins. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Congratulations. We look forward to the opening. Thank you very much. Have a good evening. Thank you for a wonderful evening.   
   
#####  Mr. Helmuth   
   
So next we have item 16 for approval and change of ownership interest for an all-alcohol package store for Santa Cruz LLC, 64 Summer Street. Is anyone here in the room or perhaps on Zoom?  If you're here, we have somebody in Zoom coming in. Thomas Truax. You should be able to unmute yourself and turn your camera on again. Excuse me. If anybody else is here for that item, there we go. Good evening, sir. Mr. Chair, members of the board, yes, Attorney Tom Truax here of the state of Massachusetts on behalf of the licensee, Santa Cruz LLC. And I believe with me virtually is Alex Rodriguez. He's the proposed new member of the LLC. Before he was a petition for a change of the membership interest. Right now there are two members in the LLC and they have proposed to sell and convey to Mr. Rodriguez each of them a 5% interest in the LLC. So Mr. Rodriguez would end up as a 10% owner. All the financials, the purchase and sale agreement between the parties have been included in our submittal. As for Mr. Rodriguez, he's been an employee there for, I believe, almost 11 years. Not only this ownership, but the prior owners as well. He works there full time and basically this is a reward for his years of service from the current ownership. So I think it's a great thing. He's excited as heck. And besides being just working there full time, he will now have a stake in the corporation, a stake in the business. So we're just asking the board to approve this change of ownership interest. Thank you, sir. Return to the board, Mrs. Mahon. I would like to move approval. And I just would like to say that previous to this ownership conglomeration thereof, we did have some issues at this particular establishment on Summer Street. And the LLC and the individuals contained therein came in. And I'm happy to say we haven't heard anything since, which tells me that they took this board's concerns very seriously regarding the previous ownership and LLC's violations. And I definitely was pleased that Mr. Rodriguez is part of the business and knows the day-to-day routine. I don't know. It's up to him if there's anything he wants to say or if he just wants to let us do all the talking. And I'll leave that to him. If he raises his hand, he wants to say anything. But I'll be happy to move approval. Second. Any further discussion? So we have a motion of approval from Mrs. Mahon, seconded by Mr. DiCorsi. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? Unanimous approval. Congratulations, Mr. Rodriguez, and best of luck to you. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
We now turn to item 17 for approval, an all-alcohol package store, city wine, spirits, and smoke shop from Nikon 232 Incorporated. We have delegation, including a Shikha Patel owner-manager, and I see they were present. Feel free to pull up another chair, and then as you speak, you can swap around the microphone and try to move the microphone a little bit just for the cable audience. So, we have updated packets in front of us.   
   
##### Shikha Patel   
   
Good evening. Hi. Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board, Andrew Upton for the applicant. With me is Yashika Patel, co-owner and proposed manager of Record, and her husband, Nilesh Patel. Welcome. Yeah. Yeah. Please proceed. If you are ready, I would briefly like to talk about the character and fitness of the applicant to hold the license. The character and fitness of this applicant, we believe, is strong. Yashika is approved by the town of Tewksbury to hold the liquor license. Nilesh is not a partner in this business, but he has recently been approved by the City of Boston and the ABCC to hold a liquor license, and they work closely together on the operations and the issues. This is a well-capitalized enterprise. Yashika has quite a bit of experience in age-restricted product and ID checking. They are Cambridge residents, so they are quite nearby, and she will be taking charge of this store on a full-time basis, should it be approved. It's a family business. The Patels are using their own personal funds, and the balance is a loan from the brother and brother-in-law of the Patels. So it is a closely held family business, which will be run by the Patels, staffed by the Patels. It will be run by the other staff members as well. As I'm sure you're looking at, Mr. Heim, Attorney Heim has given a list of considerations for the board, so I thought I would just run through those, and we're certainly glad to answer any questions along the way or after, just to give a brief overview. The views of the inhabitants of the town, obviously important in a hearing like this. We have 48 letters of support we have submitted in our packet, and we, as of today, we have two more, which include the owner of the Novita Salon and the Venice Italian Kitchen, which, as you probably know, are the two abutting businesses on the same block. And I suggest to you that the interest of the inhabitants is very positive for this proposal. The Patels and some of their associates actually walked up and down the block talking to people to solicit this support, explaining the concept, explaining what they were doing, how they were doing it, what their proposal was, and a surprisingly large group of people were willing to sign and submit letters in support. On top of that, the two abutting businesses obviously do not see it as a detriment to their operation, since they are also in favor. During our outreach to the community and our discussions with the Board of Health, we came to the conclusion, based on the input from people, that tobacco products at this location were not what the community wanted. We understand how the rules and regulations work, and we have reached out to the people, and we have listened to them, and I'm here to tell you that we are proposing a liquor store, not a tobacco store, and we have no pending applications for any tobacco licenses and no plans to apply for them. Further along that, this will be a, we believe, a unique type of liquor store. This is a high-end wine and spirits and beer store. We will not sell any single-serving bottles, formerly known as nips, we will not sell any malt liquor, we will not sell any cakes, we will not have neon beer signs in the window, we will not have posters advertising 36 packs of Bud Light and things like that. It will be tasteful, visible, transparent, well-designed, and not saturated in the kind of advertising you see in some other places. We will also have no lottery. So we're looking at a wine experience, craft beer, artisanal spirits, higher-end store, which we believe will be a big plus for the neighborhood and also unique for the neighborhood. So just running down the list from Attorney Heim, traffic considerations, obviously important as you drive up and down Mass Ave. to all the retail stores, traffic and parking are a challenge, yet we believe that this would be an appropriate location for a liquor store. We're essentially have opposite hours of the post office, which does its majority business nine to five, where we are more likely to do business in the four to seven range. The post office does the majority of its business on Saturdays in the morning, we would do the majority of our business on Saturdays in the afternoon. So we think that would be a favorable contrast. As you may know, this location has been a retail store for a generation at least. It was a dry cleaner up until two years ago. For several years before that, it was a grocery store. Noise concerns, we do not expect noise to be generated from a retail store any more than it would any other retail store. The size of the establishment is quite manageable. The type of establishment is obviously a package store. The reputation of the applicant is very solid. As I said, they've been approved by two towns and the ABCC to hold a liquor license, so I think their credentials speak for themselves. The total number of licenses in the community, as you know, this is an open license under the quota, so population-wise, there is a need for one more license. The views and the habits of the town we have discussed, excuse me, the level of direct involvement of the owners and stockholders is clear, as I've discussed. The size of store, traffic and noise, seems like we've covered that. The variety of product, we are, again, not going to have nips, not going to have malt liquor, not going to have kegs. We are focused on good wines, for which there will be wine tasting and wine pairing events and activities. The quality of the training program, this is described in our brochure, but in their other stores and also in their other businesses. Tips training, ID scanner, significant amount of cameras that record the activities and are able to be shared with the police, so very, very strong compliance program and also a desire to work with local businesses and the police and any community outreach people to further dissuade young people from trying to buy liquor, but a very strong compliance program is already in place. As I said, we've received great input from the abutters and from the general public, and that is basically our overview. And before I go on too long, we're glad to answer any questions. Thank you for that. I will turn to the Board for discussion.   
   
##### Mrs. Mahon   
   
Ms. Mahon. Oh, Ms. Mahon, sorry. Good to see you. Ms. Mahon. Hi. Sorry, I was going through the application. I usually print everything out because I'm still a paper person, but I didn't do that tonight, so that's fine. Now, I understand, I believe from the application and from your attorney, that Ms. Patel will be who will be on site the majority of the time. I will. You will. And I know your attorney, you said attorney, correct? Yeah. Your attorney represented that you have been approved elsewhere. How are you going to split your time between Tewksbury and I forget what the other community was, or are you not? Are you going to be Arlington-based?  Yeah. Arlington only? Yeah, I'll be at Arlington only, and Tewksbury will be managed by employees and management. Okay. And she is a Cambridge resident, so she'll be coming from fairly close by. Okay. And then I know your attorney referenced the TIPS program and the ID scanner. It may be in here, and I apologize, I just didn't see it, but do you have, will you have an employee handbook as what, A, employee handbook, and B, how will you oversee, administrate to make sure everybody is TIPS trained, as well as trained on the ID machine, as well as that machine is fully functioning appropriately?  Yeah. So I am already TIPS trained, and the ID scanner, we will make sure we work with the company of whatever ID scanner we choose to work with this location, and train whoever will be working with me, and make sure that they know how to use the machine. And both of those will be mandatory before the store opens. Okay. And again, it may be, I do have what you all provided us, and it may be in here, and if it is, I apologize, I just didn't see it, but if it's not, in terms of, and if you don't have the answer tonight, that's okay, but what case point scenario that you use the ID machine, and realize that the ID that's been submitted is not valid, and is forged in some way or other. Do you have a policy, what your next step is on that? Meaning, do you return it, do you retain it, if you retain it, are there any steps after that? Yes, we have to, according to what I learned in TIP certification, and just my experience with our 21 plus smoke shops that I've managed for a couple of years, we just need to be able to handle the customer in a proper manner, so that we don't aggravate the situation or anything like that, but we should just deny service to them. Okay. And then, where you are focusing on, and I won't go into that, we had here last week an Arlington brewery that's just getting started, so not in any stores or anything yet, and I have no interest in the brewery company, but I know that some of the other establishments do have wine tastings or something around that. Is that something you've given thought to? It's okay if you haven't, but if it's something you've given thought to, I'd like to hear how you envision that possibly happening. I'm not saying that's something you have to do. Yes. So if we do consider doing wine tastings, we are going to source our wines from local towns and neighborhoods in the Northeast, and they do offer their reps to come out and do tastings and things like that. So that's something we would consider. We would just be willing to work with the companies on that. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair.   
   
##### Mr. DeCourcey.   
   
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a few questions procedurally. When the application was initially submitted, there was a building plan that was submitted with the application, and at that point, I believe that you were planning on opening both the alcohol and a smoke shop, and I know that there was something that was delivered to the board on Friday, but I don't think there was any indication that you sought to amend the application. I think that the package may have been dropped off at the board. I just wanted to ask you, it seems to me that we have a situation here where we have an application. Clearly, the intent at that time was to have the smoke shop. If I look at your articles of organization, you were incorporated for the purpose to operate a retail liquor store and a smoke shop. I think this is the only asset of that entity. So my question is, we're acting on something here. I'm just wondering why the application wasn't amended or the first one withdrawn with a new one put in because clearly, based on what you're talking about tonight, it's a different operation. I also want to ask you if you've amended your articles of organization to remove the smoke shop. I think Andrew can best answer that. Yes. This application is based on the ABCC and the town's application for a liquor license. This application doesn't ask. It doesn't have anything to do with liquor. As we were making our proposal, initially we considered city wine, spirits, and smoke shop. During our outreach and our discussions with the Board of Health, we came to understand that that was not desirable for Arlington. So not only does this application not include any requests for tobacco, we're here to tell you we are not coming back with any requests for tobacco. Okay. And we will be not using the word smoke in the title either. Okay. And just in terms of what we receive, we ask for a package with the application. One of the things that we ask for in addition to the lease is a plan. And clearly the plan that at least was on file showed there's a humidor in the back of the building, for example. And so maybe a question for Attorney Heim in terms of what's before us, notwithstanding the package that Attorney Upton has with him tonight. It seems to me absent some notification that the application has changed and the application does talk about it doing business as city wine, spirits, and smoke shop, it seems like we have one thing in the application and another thing tonight. And so I'm just wondering from Attorney Heim what, in his view, what would be necessary for an amendment or a reapplication given what we've just learned here in the presentation. Attorney Heim?  So let me just make sure I understand. Is this the same as... what's been uploaded to the agenda, if I may ask? The application has it as DBA city transparency from the ABCC. I see. So, from my understanding, the application includes some details including the name of the entity. This is more just an informational packet for the board. It doesn't necessarily reflect the plans that are in the application that was submitted to the ABCC. Is that correct? I believe the floor plan is the same. The application under two, the first section, so license information, ABCC application online that you fill out and submit to us, has your DBA as city wine spheres and smoke shop. Understood. I think that's the confusion. I'm sorry, if I could just ask, is there, are there two separate, is there not a floor plan submitted with the application to the ABCC? Yes. Can you just pull it up, please? No, no problem. That, I believe, was submitted on March 7th, and that's part of our application process, and I believe, well, I know it's different than what's in the book here tonight. Well, I guess what I would recommend, and I don't want to speak for the applicants, is some kind of formal amendment so that we're not approving something that is approved by the ABCC as X and we're approving Y. There's a couple different ways that that can be achieved. I don't know if the applicant has a specific perspective on that, but from my perspective, I understand your concern, which is that you're being asked to approve a license under the DBA that includes at least some level of detail about a smoke shop. My understanding is the applicants no longer want to pursue that, so depending on what the board wants to do, it may be necessary to make some formal amendment to the application to make sure there's not future confusion. Exactly that. Just the state of what's before us and not knowing where we're going as a board here, because I just do feel that completeness of the record is important, and it's also important that what we have in the office from what was submitted earlier is consistent with what you're asking for tonight. May I, Mr. Chairman? Yes, of course. I think Attorney Heim has got it exactly right. It's well within the board's power, should you choose to approve this application, to make a motion to approve it with the DBA that does not say smoke and with a floor plan that does not include humidors. I mean, all that could be done right here and now, if you so desire. I do agree that the board is within its power to set certain conditions, but I also understand Mr. Corsi's point, which is that I think the concern of the board is they don't want to be voting on what the formal application is versus the understanding of what it would likely be, given that it's already been submitted to the ABCC, right? No. It is well within the power of the board to make a motion to approve any variation that you want. And the way the process works is the city is the first approver, and whatever you approve goes to record. We're a town. We're a town. Pardon me? No, that means a lot. Oh, no, I understand. If you do business like that, it's going to hurt. I understand. I apologize. The local licensing authority is the first approver, and what the town approves goes to the ABCC. The ABCC has not yet received anything and will not consider anything unless it comes through this board with modifications by this board. Sure. I guess I just want to clarify something, though. Are you proposing to formally amend your application, or are you saying that the board is going to set the condition that this is what you can and cannot do? I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. No, that's fine. This is constructive, so I'm happy to permit you. Sorry, Mr. Chairman. Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine. I mean, if it's the pleasure of the board to approve, I'm happy to do it either way. Okay. That's helpful. I think it's a helpful clarification. Anything further on that point, Mr. Gershwin?   
   
##### Mrs. Mahon   
   
Yeah. Well, I think what's helpful for, just speaking for myself, is you've made a decision based on feedback, and that's certainly, I think, given your discussions with the Health Department, that a smoke shop and a package store can't operate in Arlington, right? And so it's not us telling you that. It seems to me that having that change, the amendment should come from the advocate, not from the board in terms of what the conditions are. And I'm just concerned because when this came to us, and Ms. Meyer, I understand this was delivered to the board office on Friday. Thursday. On Thursday, but no cover letter, nothing saying that this is what it is. I mean, again, just for what's before us and whatever conditions, whether it's neighbors that are challenging what happens, if it's an affirmative vote, or I don't know where we're going to go as a board, but it seems like the state of the application should reflect what you're asking for us to do. This is the first time you're before us. You've made some changes to what you've done, and then what I'm hearing is, well, you can condition it on some things. I'd rather have you say affirmatively, this is what we're asking the board to approve now through the application. And, again, it just seems like that's a clearer way to develop a record of what we've done and what you've asked for. Right. Well, I will say right now we're asking you to approve the name City Wine and Spirits. Okay. Can I just? Yeah, if you want to say something. I just want to say, and you know how they say a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. I'm just, my day job is court reporter, so I'm really big on process and housekeeping as well as, and I'm not saying other cities and towns don't take alcohol, package store licenses very seriously, but the board does, and we try to treat everybody as the senior member on the board, which I never thought I'd say that, the oldest, longest member or whatever. We've done everything the same way all the time. And what I'm fearful of is if I'm prepared to vote on, if I was prepared to vote on the application that's before us tonight, it would not be successful from Board of Health and other talent departments. I understand you and your attorney have met with them and have changed and modified that. For the board to vote something, to not have something actually before us from the application and something that we have to oversee, administer, I don't think we should start doing for package stores that sort of process. I think that's where I would not be comfortable with the suggestion of it could be approved with me understanding a certain thing that that's not what's before me. So I'll stop there.   
   
##### Mr. DeCourcey   
   
I think... Yeah, no, as I think this through, and again, I think it makes sense for Attorney Upton perhaps to contact Attorney Heim in terms of just developing exactly what you're looking for, and I'm going to make a motion to table this, or continue the hearing rather, so that we can get that clarification so it's absolutely clear, lined up, what's in the application, what you're looking for, because while you have cited a number of letters of support, we've also gotten a number of letters from neighbors that have opposed this, and some of it is because of the smoke shop aspect, and some of it is for other things. So this isn't one of those applications that is before us where everybody who has been contacted supports it, and that there's a somewhat unique procedural history on this as well where I think it's important that we're all on the same page, at least what you're presenting to us. And so I'm just concerned about lining that up, and I'd rather not do it through conditions. I'd rather do it through an amendment to the application so that we all know what we're looking at, and we're all on the same page. Notwithstanding what you told us tonight, this is what you'll be doing. So, Mr. Gorsuch, in your motion to table, do you... Or continue. To continue. Yeah, sorry. Mr. Chairman, if I may. Just a moment, please. Would the continuation be to a specific date? What parameters would you, in your motion, just so I can get this clear in the motion, then we'll go to more discussion. Yeah. Well, I think, and again, we may hear from Attorney Upton in terms of some time issues, but, I mean, I think it's we don't have another scheduled meeting until July. If there's some other issues that can be done, I think maybe it's at the call of the Chair in terms of between now and then to come back. But I think there are points that need to be clarified. Yes, sir, Mr. Attorney Upton. The way I see it at this point is if we were to amend and change the application, the only thing we would do is white out the word smoke under the DBA. To me, that seems a little bit formal over substance. There is no tobacco application or smoke shop application in front of you. That's a separate board and a separate application, and that's not something we're considering at this time. If you vote yes, you do not grant tobacco. If we say, on the record, we will not apply for tobacco, we would hope you would take us at our word. But we're more than willing to come back and engage in more discussion, but literally what you're asking us to do right now is white out five letters from the cover sheet of a 40-page application, and I'd like to hear more as to whether that's, you know, completely necessary. Yeah. Well, no. I would like to give you a little bit more. We received this on Friday. Okay. Every member in this hearing had been continued from a few weeks ago because of whatever circumstance, we got a request, can you continue the meeting until tonight? And so for us as a board, preparing for a hearing based on the state of the record, what was filed here a couple months ago, and then I saw this for the first time today. It was posted over the weekend, okay, and I inquired of Ms. Marr, okay, where did this come from? Did you receive a cover letter from Attorney Upton explaining what this is? And the answer was no. So we're sitting up here as a board, and we have one set of facts that we've all been working on. We prepared on June 5th for a certain set of facts. I'm pointing out there wasn't a tobacco license on June 5th, but there was a different intention in terms of what you wanted to do. Now we have this. I think it behooves the applicant to make the change, to come back before us in terms of what exactly you're looking for, and to say we're just going to white out a few things. I put it to you. If that's all you had to do, why didn't you change the application so that we could consider it? Because you can consider it. It's well within your power to do so administratively. But no explanation, nothing. This is what was dropped off, okay? So none of us, and my colleagues can talk about what they had. We didn't know what you were proposing or that you were no longer doing a smoke shot based on what came in. And so I think for the state of the record and for what happened, I think it should be cleaned up based on what's happened. I've never had an application for an alcohol license come in where things have changed in terms of what's going to be there before the board, okay, on the night of the hearing without an explanation. And I think we should have a clean application or an amended. And maybe there's something else that needs to be changed, because you're talking about five letters. Well, as I said, the document that was submitted that had the plan of the building is different than what's in here. So even a cover letter from you, this is now what's different from what we submitted, from what we're looking for. I still have a question about your articles of organization, because you're still organized to operate a smoke shot. I think a little additional time to clean that up for our consideration, I don't see where the harm would be to do that just so we're all we all have the same information before us. And I'm seeing your client nod his head, but I know we're more than willing to do that. But can I refer you to page 1 of this document? And, you know, it is traditional for applicants to come before the board with materials amplifying, discussing, and illustrating the application, and it's traditional for you to ask questions and for us to answer. That's all this is. This doesn't change the application one bit, and there's an introductory cover letter on page 1. And, again, this is outside. And, Attorney Heim, I'm going to go there because, I mean, we have a change in application. Will you have an appeal before the ABCC on another application that you submitted? I believe that's still pending. So what's before the ABCC? Is it this, or is it what you submitted that you didn't get a hearing on earlier? Mr. Chairman, can I ask for a brief recess? Sure. The meeting will be in recess. All right. We are back in session. Give the technology a moment to catch up with us. Good, Ms. Maher? Yes. Okay. We're back. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I feel that I'm fortunate to be heard by the board. I feel like the board is especially fortunate to have board counsel as skilled and diplomatic as they do. And based on those comments, I would suggest that we accede to your request to come back at a future date to amend whatever amendments are necessary. And I would also suggest that, if it pleases the board, we take a few more minutes to answer any other questions or issues as long as we're here on the application. Thank you. I appreciate the spirit of that. I think it's an appropriate use of time. Mr. Gorski, do you have anything further? I don't. Thank you for those comments and working with Attorney Heim and taking the time to think that over. And I don't have any further questions right now.   
   
##### Mr. Hurd   
   
Thank you. I would say that I certainly look forward to the business. I think I have no problem with the location. Having an accurate floor plan for us is important, even if it's a small change. Arlington has a pretty short history with liquor stores. So every time we've ever looked at a liquor store, we've asked for very small changes to where a cooler is. And that's why I think it's very important for us to see exactly what's being proposed in front of us. Just a comment that not for the next meeting, but in perpetuity, I certainly trust the word that's put in front of me. We have heard before with other applicants, not you, that they weren't going to put advertisements and Marlboro ads and whatever else in the windows. So that is also important to this board. And since the inception of the liquor stores, we've always had the signed regulations. There are a lot of signed regulations, too. So just going forward, and I think maybe we'll discuss this the next time we're on as well, that's something, appearance from the street, is something that is important to this board and the town residents. And we've had successes and non-successes with businesses relative to that. That I just asked. I was looking at your list. Are you going to sell Prime? Sorry? Are you going to sell Prime? If it's available. My kids are very, every time, my eight-year-old is often asking me to go to the liquor store down the street. So it's a little uncomfortable for me, but Prime is taking over the world, it seems like. It is. But just to lighten the mood. So one comment. With the floor plan, we'll make those adjustments 100%, but that will, again, still has to go to the building department. So anything that we submit has to go through the building department approval and then the process of occupancy. And in terms of just a little bit of experience, my wife and I have been working hand-to-hand to open numerous retail stores for the last 20 years. I've only operated retail stores, and she's grown up. We've been together 15 years, and all she's done is retail. She went to college, got a degree, but we're in the retail business. So we understand the repercussions of adult-use retail establishments, and that's primary our focus. The majority of our establishments are in Boston, all adult-use retail stores. And in terms of the product and category, we follow, we have zero violations in any establishments we own, and the majority of them we've owned over a decade. The goal is to continue that. And just following on that, one thing we don't sell is candy, gum, mints, stuff at the counter that would appeal to the under-21 crowd. Yeah. And we certainly understand the inspection process. It's just I don't think we've ever approved any business without an accurate formula, and that's just something that we look for. I look forward to continuing this and certainly having a productive discussion at the next meeting that this comes up. So I'll second Mr. DeCourcey's motion. Can I speak?  Yeah, sure. Just a comment and then a couple of quick questions. You do know that the name of this is just going to confuse everyone as to whether Arlington is a city or a town. I mean, so I say it humorously, but hey, who knows? Maybe you're presaging something. But that aside, so are you anticipating that most of the customers are going to walk to the store? Sorry, I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry. Are you anticipating that most of the customers are going to walk to the store? We are anticipating mostly pedestrians, yeah. Okay. All right. You know, so then we have some things that we're working through in town, so if the parking in front went away or was reduced, would that be an issue for you? No, like I said, we're anticipating mostly pedestrians, so it should be fine. All right. All right. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. I have a couple questions as well. I'd like to inquire any reference to public opinion, and, you know, the board received, I think, from recollection, five or six individualized, very detailed personal letters from the community that had concerns about the location vis-a-vis density and that there are other package stores within a radius. So I noted with interest the significant number of signed, mostly hand-signed letters, and I also noticed it was a form letter, so they're all the same, and I wonder if you could, just for our understanding of the process and the quality of those expressions of support, if you could detail for me how you went about soliciting that support and, you know, kind of explain why they're all the same words. Yes. Some of the people that we work with drafted these letters, and they walked up and down the block in approximately the 200s of Mass Ave. talking to people who were residents, visitors or shoppers, and said, hey, we're proposing this. What do you think?  Would it be a good idea? What do you like about it? What don't you like about it? Some said they liked it. Some said they didn't like it so much. Some said they liked it a lot. And the people that liked it a lot, we asked them to sign a letter. So we had them there, and they signed it, much like you would with a petition. I mean, some people said, I really like this concept, but I don't want to give you my phone number. I don't want to say, you know, I don't like to write. I'm in a hurry. I've got to go. But the response was overwhelmingly positive. All right. Thank you. And interest. I noted that, you know, the report, the reports from inspectoral services, just noting that would the board grant this license, you know, that that's really just your first step and that you would, this property, because it's not in allowable use under the R6 residential zoning, would require variance from the ZBA, and then various combinations of conditions would require a further environmental design review approval by the AR, by the redevelopment board. If you comment on, you know, I'm assuming you feel that you have a viable path forward, you know, that that's a lot of hurdles, but, and I understand that we would make our decision without respect to that and leave it to those bodies to make those determinations. That withstanding, I think it speaks to how you, I'd be interested to know how you plan to address the reason for those hurdles, that this is not an allowed use in that residential zone, and, you know, all the reasons why this would trigger special review and variances and permits, and, you know, kind of what kind of a case you would expect to make to achieve success there. I am the liquor license attorney, not the zoning attorney. However, I will say that based on representations from the landlord and the nonconforming preexisting use history, both the applicant and the landlord feel comfortable that zoning relief would not be a high hurdle. And we're certainly happy to have, should we get approval from this board, I mean, I don't think you even have to condition it. It's contingent on all other permits anyway. Right. Yeah. No, that would still have to happen. Yeah. Okay. I think that gets all my questions. Do I have any further discussion on the board? Or any information? We don't really have a point of information in these proceedings. We don't have one until a meeting either. But I'm not, this is not a public hearing, so I think what we are going to do is continue, if the motion is successful, we'll do a continuation of that, and then I can contemplate, if you want to contact me afterwards, we could contemplate a public comment at that time. Attorney, do you have any comment on that ruling? No, other than to say that the board can take public comment, if it so chooses, rather than defray that. My vice chair has reminded me, for the purposes of anyone on the Zoom or in room, that I think once we take this vote, this matter will be concluded. However, the next item on the agenda is open forum. And residents can take up to three minutes to talk to the board about anything they wish. So that might be a further opportunity for any resident to make a comment on any matter that is before the board. All right. So on a motion to continue to the call of the chair, I have Mr. DeCourcey and seconded by Mr. Hurd. All in favor? Aye. Opposed?  None. Thank you for your time, for your efforts. Thank you very much. We look forward to seeing you again. Thank you. A moment to shuffle the deck here.

<details><summary>Open Forum   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
OK, now we move next to open forum. And this is the opportunity for the public to comment on anything in the meeting. We don't have any other public hearings. So when we move to open forum, I'd say if you want to make any comments about any matter, but also including anything that we're going to be taking up, that could include parking or either the parking proposals, that this would be the time in the three minutes that are granted to make the comments. So I want to also explain to people who are participating on Zoom that if you want to participate in public forum, in open forum, to please raise your hand. I got some people in the room, I think, and I've got people on Zoom, so I will go alternate back and forth. Each person, we will give three minutes to speak. And I don't think we'll need this, but I'm going to limit open forum to a period of 30 minutes tonight. Just because we have a lot of other business we get to, I think that should allow enough time for everybody. So we have a first speaker, Mr. Moore. You need to come to the table there and introduce yourself for the record.   
   
##### Steve Moore   
   
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Precinct 18, Piedmont Street. I'm not sure that the way that open forum and public comments are being handled reflects very well the way we used to do it in the before COVID times. I'm not sure why it is now that we're doing hybrid that we're reverting still to the COVID-forced open forum approach. We used to take comments on each item, public comments when hearings occurred. We seem to have moved back from that, and I understand during COVID why that was necessary. I think now that we're moving back into more normalcy, we should go back to the way we used to do it in that I had a particular question for the applicant as a member of the public. I think they've probably left now. So I'm going to suggest that when they do come back for their continuance, that you ask them if they're going to be selling lottery tickets, because that is a little bit of a different business approach than high-end liquors, which they were moving towards. There's issues that move along with that as well as litter and all that kind of thing. So I would ask that. But obviously I was unable to ask that during the time when that was being considered by the board, and I think that's a more sensible approach is to allow that. So thank you for hearing me out. Thank you, sir, of course. And thank you for your understanding. Sure. So as I promised, I'll now go to, we'll alternate between people who are in remote land and people in the room. I think we have Jennifer Letosky. Raise Jennifer's hand. And then after that, we'll go back to someone in the room. So Ms. Letosky is coming back. We do this just so that everybody feels on equal footing.   
   
##### Jennifer Letosky   
   
Good evening, Ms. Letosky. Thank you very much. Can you hear me all right?  Yes. Great. So my name is Jennifer Letosky, and I live on Oxford Street in East Arlington Precinct 3. I'm here to discuss the dangerous traffic conditions that we have on Oxford and Winter Street. These are narrow residential streets that connect Broadway and Mass Avenue in East Arlington. They're the home to the Leslie Ellis School and Crosby Park, which has a playground, a playing field, and the tennis courts. We see a high volume of traffic using these streets to go between Mass Avenue and Broadway, many of which are traveling far too fast for narrow residential streets like this. We see a high number of cars parking in the no-parking zones on both streets, particularly during the school drop-off and pickup times, blocking driveways, preventing delivery trucks from getting through. We also have a lot of people who walk in the neighborhood and bike, particularly children, as they're going to the Thompson School, the Gibbs School, and to Crosby Park. And this combination has created an increasingly dangerous situation. It's not just theoretical. In March, a child was hit by a car on Oxford Street across from the Leslie Ellis School. She was taken to the hospital in an ambulance. And in the past seven years, there have been at least three collisions on Oxford Street, in one of which the car actually went through the brick wall of the locksmith business right on the corner. So on June 3rd, a group of 20 people met at the Leslie Ellis School to discuss our concerns and possible solutions. We represented local residents, the head of the Leslie Ellis School, other members of the community, and the newly formed Broadway Neighbors Coalition, a group of Arlington residents who want to see improvements all along the Broadway corridor in the surrounding neighborhood. So we've identified three actions that we strongly encourage the town to take. First, promote the development of a traffic management plan to improve the issues during the arrival and dismissal time at the Leslie Ellis School in time for the start of school in September. Second, implement short-term traffic calming measures, such as speed display signs or temporary bump outs like those used on Chestnut Street before construction. And three, plan and search for funding sources for long-term traffic calming measures, such as speed tables or chicanes, but put those in Oxford and Winter Street as a pilot program to then develop a traffic calming toolkit, not only for these two streets, but for residential streets across Arlington where there's so much need. So these actions align with the goals in the Connect Arlington plan, particularly enhancing safety to and from schools and community facilities, and for developing and implementing a neighborhood traffic calming program. We've sent these actions to the select board in a letter signed by 36 people. Please act on this before more people are hurt. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your comments.   
   
#####  William Gallinow, Jr.   
   
We now return to the room, and we have a gentleman who's been waiting very, very patiently. Thank you, sir. Introduce yourself and where you live for the record. Yes, I will. My name is William Gallinow, Jr. I live on Yerksville Road in Arlington. I started out as a young kid here in 1955 with my mom and dad owning a bakery up at the Heights. I ended up meeting my wife in 61, which I got married in 65, and I've been here in this town. We just celebrated our 58th wedding anniversary. One of the biggest things I'm having trouble with is the traffic for the handicapped. I have now been twice ticketed in Arlington. The first time I got ticketed was right in front of the bus stop on Mass Ave. They have a parking spot there that looks like a parking spot, but I was told downstairs the two lines out in the street don't match each other to be a parking spot. Everybody's getting tickets there, and I don't think it's fair to anybody that parks there to get a ticket, so they should, you know, put up the signs. I am an ex-town employee from the town of Lexington. I served 13 years with the town before I got hurt. The thing of it is that they have to make better signs. I was on Alton Street. They have a little 8x10 sign up on the top of a post stating that it's a loading zone. The signs for the area should be put up on the wall to show that it is a loading zone. I parked in the handicapped spot right there at the beginning of Alton Street, and there's three parking spaces and then the handicapped. The little sign is way down in the end so you can't see it, and I know Mr. Leonard, I've talked to him before about this. So anyway, just, you know, they should put signs that denominate the parking spots. There's another one up on Mass Ave. right by Mill Street where the sign is up in the light pole and it says don't park to the corner. But there's another parking spot there for somebody else that, you know, is in town and wants to park to go to these stores. And you're eliminating these parking spots, trying not to take and eliminate them, but to gain more legal parking spots so they can park their cars legally. I've already had to pay two parking tickets, and that's not my best thing, and I just, you know, I feel that all the parking should stop being looked at and all the signs should be posted legally. I worked on the signs up in Lexington. I've done a lot of them, parking meters and everything else, and it doesn't take much to make a sign to post it legally. I'll put a sign on the side of the building that says loading zone, 8 to 3 o'clock, you know, and that's where I'm coming from. I mean, there's a lot of areas in town that could be good parking spots for parking cars. There's a lot of places that are handicapped parking spots. I mean, that handicapped spot is in a place where I've never seen the sign, you know. It's a little thing in the top of a pole. We've reached our 33 minutes, but thank you for those comments. And something I didn't, I usually read ahead of time is that for open forum, the board makes a practice of listening only, and then we'll consider whether we want to bring things back to the board for the future. That's all I want. I just wanted to notify them and to see that the traffic department would, you know, get the signs out legally. Thank you, sir. And thank you for my time. Of course. All right. Do we have anybody else in Zoom who wants to participate in public forum? You can raise your hand in Zoom now. And if there's anybody else in the room who wants to participate in public forum?   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Mr. Burey. I didn't see you back there tonight. You're really increasing, too. Yeah. 15. Please enjoy our new table for the comfort of our guests. Yeah, thanks. It's cool. I'm a little perplexed. So is this, is it the only time to speak now or never? I mean, if, when the hearing is reconvened for the package store, will it be an opportunity to speak then? Mr. Turningheim. I think that the chair can afford the opportunity to speak on the record for, as part of the hearing. Yes. Yeah, that is, I mean, normally for open forum, we don't respond, but I think this is timely. That would be my intention, to afford a public comment period during that hearing. After. So they'll reconvene and you'll talk to the applicants and then people, the people will be able to speak. Yeah. I'll do a public hearing for community. Right. So then I'd rather wait. Sure. So you're not going to count this time against me? I'll stop the clock. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about? No. I'm glad I didn't. The last time I made a presentation at town hall, I got booed. So I didn't just now. I don't think we'll boo you, sir. Mr. Diggins and Mr. DeCourcey will be glad to know that I'm not going to stick around for the overnight parking. Bring it on. Just bring it. All right. Thank you, sir. Do we have any other participants for open forum? Open forum? Yeah. Please go. It's a duty. Good evening. Good evening. So this is for open forum? Yes. State your name and address for the record, please.   
   
##### Lisa Cronin   
   
I'm Lisa Cronin. I am the landlord of 232 Mass Ave. So, and I was born and bred in Arlington. I'm an Arlington, Calwood graduate. And I just, I guess my family's owned this property since the 70s. I took over in 1999. During COVID, Rainbow Cleaners, the owner of Rainbow Cleaners decided to retire after the tiring, trying to get through COVID in a failing business. He tried to sell it. You know, I worked with all my tenants to try to help them save their businesses through COVID. I've been working with my three sons. This is one of my sons. Just to clarify, 232 is where the liquor store is? Oh, I'm sorry. No, that's good for the benefit of the public. Thank you. For two years, we've been working tirelessly trying to get that place rented to a reputable business that could come in and, you know, run a reputable business there. It's been, and right now I feel like, I guess, you know, tonight was a little frustrating for us. And I understand that you need to have all your T's crossed and your dots, your I's. I'm sorry. That's okay. It's fine. You know, anyways, yeah, I guess I just wanted to get up here and at least state, you know, where we're coming from. I'm a single mom. I'm a registered nurse trying to get this place rented, like I said, to a reputable person, which I think these people, you know, I've visited their other stores, and I think that they would be a great asset to Arlington as well. I'll only be a minute. Just wanted to emphasize a few points from what she said, just that COVID was tough. We worked with the other tenants, and we were able to make sure that they all stayed in business, and we're very proud of that, that it has been very tough financially. as well. I'm a single mom nurse. We've taken out a lot of loans to get it in a place where we have a tenant who wants to go in there right now and we've lost rent for over two years from that now that we've been trying to support the rest of our lives with and then on top of that a lot of time. So I'm a consultant during the day but two to three nights a week or on the weekends I'm coming up doing stuff that the tenant would be doing like taking care of this inside of it. Shoveling. Shoveling anything outside to make sure that it's safe for everyone else there. Dealing with potential tenants and we've had a lot of potential tenants. We've been working with a broker as well. I think that we finally found a really good tenant for the town of Arlington so just hope that's taken into consideration when we come before you again. Hopefully enjoy. Thank you. Thank you for speaking. Thank you. We have one more raised hand if Susanna Fitzgerald is here for open forum. Bring Susanna in for comment. And Susanna you can unmute yourself. Hi I'm Susanna Fitzgerald and I live next door at 230 Mass Avenue. I'm an owner of a condo there and I've owned it for 36 years. A number of us really are very upset about this proposal. There are two other liquor stores within half a mile of this particular location. It is a residential area. Our driveway is between our building and 232. It's a very narrow driveway with parking in the back. When the dry cleaner was there we already had a lot of problems with people coming to the dry cleaners that would block our driveway. Constantly this happened. We had to go to them and tell us we have signs that say resident parking only but they still doing it. The liquor store will be much more invasive in that respect. We also are opposed to it because of the hours going to 11 o'clock at night with lights on. Our building is very very close. Actually we will see these lights from our units in our building. So we don't approve of that at all. We don't think that we need another liquor store in the area. The traffic situation is very very bad at that corner with Orvis Street. In the past there has been at least one accident with a pedestrian being hit. It's constantly a problem with people trying to cut through from Lake Street to come up to Mass Avenue whenever they can even though there are certain times of the day that are now no longer allowed. So they cut up that way and then they turn left on Mass Avenue to go west towards the center. That causes much more traffic. It's very difficult to see with three lanes of traffic. There haven't been accidents. We don't want this kind of traffic situation there. And you know because they actually have flags on either side of Mass Avenue at Orvis there for people to cross with to use the flags because it's such a difficult intersection particularly at night in the dark when pedestrians are trying to cross. We feel very strongly that this is an unnecessary business to put into this neighborhood. We don't need it. There's no reason for it to be there. I understand that the landlord would like to rent the space. We would like to see it rented too. We enjoy the neighborhood as a pedestrian friendly neighborhood where people can walk. It's dangerous enough as it is there. We don't need an alcohol store to be there when there are two others within such a closed space. I also would like to say that the number of letters that were shown by the people that want to do this, they were form letters. They asked people without any information about the real situation. A number of those people who signed that letter are on streets that are, they're certainly not abutters. And in fact a number of them are two, three miles away. They have nothing to do with our neighborhood. So they don't know what the situation is. It is a very difficult place for us to be. We have liked the situation where we live there for all these many years and we'd like it to continue. It's a pedestrian friendly and neighborhood friendly establishment. Thank you. Thank you very much. This concludes our open forum for the evening. Thanks to all who took the time to bring the concerns before the board.

<details><summary>Overnight Parking Waiver   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Now move to item 18, request for an on-street overnight parking waiver for James Foley. Another very patient individual. Well I think I'm a little humbled by everything that came in front of me actually. So a lot of very interesting proposals.   
   
##### James Foley   
   
My name is James Foley and I'm the owner of the residence at 1113 Moulton Road. It's been a family home since we had it built in 1907. I was not around at that time. I was born at Sims Hospital at 1962. But I've owned that property for the past probably 20 years. It's been in our family since 1907. I actually live up along Middle Road where parking's not an issue. We actually have a driveway so we can get the cars in off the street. I have my youngest of four daughters living at 11 Moulton Road right now with a roommate, recent graduate. And up until this day when I lived on Moulton Road, never had a parking pick in my life. But we park in the street. Most of the homes on Moulton Road as you know actually have no driveways. And we did have a driveway built over the years. My grandparents did actually and it got developed. We have tenants upstairs that have been here over 30 years and they are elderly. They have two cars and a driveway. My daughter's been parking in the street. And you had mentioned one of the members have children. Well, my daughter's been getting parking tickets very, very frequently lately. Almost every other night or third night or fourth night. And guess who she goes to to help pay for those parking tickets since she's a recent grad. And what I was hoping to do since we've had the house for so long, we've been long-term Arlington residents, but graduate Arlington Catholic, is possibly get a temporary overnight parking permit for say a year if that is possible without inconveniencing the neighbors. Of course if there are snowstorms we'll get the car off the road. We'll do other things in clement weather, anything like that. I'm just looking for a little bit of reprieve so we don't have to pay all these parking tickets. I did start out by going to a police station and they did say they understood the concern on Moulton, the lack of driveways, that sort of thing. They typically don't like the ticket but apparently had some complaints from some people who didn't have parking. And so they did complain at that point. My daughter does park directly in front of our two-family home. She doesn't block anybody else's driveway. She doesn't interfere with anybody else at all. I'm just hoping for a small reprieve if at all possible. Because as they said earlier in the evening, when you get tickets regularly it does get expensive. Having four daughters, I'll tell you, can be expensive enough. Anyways, and I was just throwing myself in the mercy of the select board to see if there's anything you could do for me. Thank you sir. Turn to the board.   
   
   
##### Mr. Hurd   
   
This is a very interesting request. I don't know if you've seen our full agenda. But as of right now, and this might change in about five minutes, you don't qualify for our current standards for overnight parking. I don't know if we, I don't want to keep you here later, if you want to table the request. Because, I mean, I would just say I don't want to make light of your situation, but as of right now, our policy has always been, if there's a driveway at the property, that we don't grant overnight parking permits. There's a lot of properties in the same board as you. There's a lot of two families in Arlington. A lot of them are tandem parking. It's always been, if there is parking, we haven't granted those permits because, I mean, you had mentioned having it for one year. Once we, traditionally when we've granted overnight parking waivers, it's been sort of in perpetuity because the clerks department handles it beyond us. But we are, in our next agenda item, talking about a pilot program to allow overnight parking. So, I mean, again, I don't know if we should table it, if you want to stick around, or I can turn to my colleagues for additional insight. I think just procedurally, I'm not sure it matters a great deal, because I think if the applications were for permission under current standards, I think it's pretty clear, if my colleagues, you know, if our colleagues agree with you, but I think anyone's welcome to stick around for further discussion on an agenda item. Any other comments or questions from the board?   
   
##### Mr. DeCourcey   
   
Yeah, and it may be longer than a five-minute presentation on the subsequent item, but I agree with Mr. Hurd. I mean, I think we may be addressing something that would apply at least on a short term to your situation, but unfortunately what you're presenting, where things stand, where you are on the agenda tonight, it wouldn't meet our standard, but maybe just stay tuned. I'll wait around for the next presentation to hear that. I'll tell you what to select what has to say. Thank you very much for your time. We really appreciate it. So, a motion to deny the application? No action? I know deny seems a little harsh. To take no action on the application?  Second. All right, so we have a, with the friendliest of intentions, a vote, a motion of no action by Mr. Hurd, a second by Mr. DeCourcey. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed?  Thank you very much. I'll wait and listen. That's right. All right. Can I register that I abstain on that? Okay, so we have an abstention. So, it was four in favor, with Mr. Diggins abstaining. Of course.   
   </summary> </details>
<details><summary>Parking Proposal   
   
##### Mr. DeCourcey   
   
Okay, I think we have now reached the item 20, final presentation and vote over a parking proposal. And we have Mr. DeCourcey and Mr. Diggins, do you have a slide? Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and we have a PowerPoint that we can walk through, and I want to thank the board and thank the public in particular that we have been talking about this a lot longer than all of us expected when we first brought this up a few years ago or started talking about things. And I want to thank Mr. Diggins for his collaboration, and we've been trying to work on a proposal for the full board to consider a pilot program. I thought, briefly, for the public's benefit, I'd step back just a little bit, give a little bit of background, and then present the proposal that we have come up with for the board's consideration for a pilot. So, if I could, just for a second, yeah, give us, there we go, went full screen, we're good to go. Okay, so, we have talked about the situation in Arlington where there is the overnight parking ban. There are a series of exemptions or waivers that are allowed that I want to touch on briefly. But in terms of references that we've made for the public to our rules, the references to overnight parking actually occur in two places, in our traffic rules and orders and in our parking policies and regulations. And if Ms. Marr brings this forward, this is the reference to the all-night parking ban that's in our traffic rules and orders. There's a more complete reference in the parking policies, if we can go to that. And again, it states that there's no overnight parking between the hours of 1 and 7 a.m. If we go to the next slide, however, there are four exceptions that have been applied over the years and that are contained within our policies. One is short-term. That's if someone is visiting a home or a driveway is being repaired or if a car is disabled. And that short-term is, and I will go through each exception, that is done through the police department. The next three, the temporary or long-term in the municipal lot is a treasurer's office request. The final two are select board requests. Temporary or long-term on street and hardship exemption on street. Ms. Marr, thank you. Again, here's a little description of the short-term. Up to 14 days a year, the reasons that we put in the policy, it's just as I said, expecting an overnight guest and the two other categories, there's no fee for that. I will say Mr. Diggins and I did receive some feedback from people who may have weekend guests from time to time, family visiting. The 14 days appears to be a hardship for some people. There was some requests to extend that. We're not here to do that this evening, but again, something to think about as we go forward. And that's issued through the police department. There is instructions in terms of how to contact the police department for that. The second category is municipal lot parking. And this is done through the treasurer's office. And this covers the situation where a family or household has parking, has a driveway, but has more cars than can fit. And what happens here is that the resident can go to the treasurer's office. It's a dollar a day, and the individual is assigned a parking spot in one of our municipal lots. We can move on to the next one. Again, it's discretionary, but this one really is the least discretionary. You have a car. You could theoretically park it at your house, but you don't have enough room because you have three or four other cars or two or three other cars. The next category is what we often see here is the on-street parking issued by the select board, valid for space in front of or adjacent to the permanent holder's residence. But the conditions, we just brought them up with Mr. Foley that come up, is there a driveway? Is there construction taking place? So we'll do it on a temporary basis. For this one, it's $160 for the first year, $75 per year afterwards. And then the final category that we see is the hardship exemption. This came just a few years ago where, again, it's for residents. You have to establish that off-street parking is unavailable and that they have a long-term or permanent disability or can't afford off-street parking due to economic hardship. There's no fee for that. We see this often on a temporary basis, both this one and the prior discretionary where there may be a caretaker that has to come in, a family situation on a short-term basis. We also see it on a more permanent basis. So what we did, and we've talked about our waivers and our exceptions, but both Mr. Diggins and I felt like, okay, let's give the board and the public a little bit more information as to what we're doing right now as a town. And so the three discretionary permits, and this excludes the short-term that are issued by the police, which is an allowance of an overnight, there are 44 permits issued for the municipal lot parking. What I did is, and I want to thank Ms. Marr for assisting me. She gathered a lot of information, provided a lot of feedback to me, and I think as we went through this, we learned a lot, too. The three top precincts here, Precinct 9, Precinct 20, and Precinct 7, and what we found here is that for the municipal lot parking, the majority of this is people who are in housing authority properties. For Precinct 20, it's people at Drake Village who park at the Hurd Field and on Drake Road. Precinct 9 includes a number of people both at Winslow Towers and at Chestnut Manor. In Precinct 7, you can see it goes all the way down to 2. Every other precinct that's represented has no more than one permit. The on-street permits for people who might not have parking available to them, again, the three biggest precincts, a little bit of a surprise here, Precinct 6, Precinct 8, and Precinct 20 were the top three. And this goes to what I'm going to get to in a little bit in terms of whether we do this town-wide or targeted, because when we look at these, at least what's granted, it's all over town. Hardship exemption permits, Precinct 19 is the most, and that's really one property. It's the new apartment building at 483 Summer Street, has the majority of those. Precinct 1 has five, and Precincts 3 and 6 both have four each. This is what's currently issued by the town. Red sticker for the overnight, for the municipal lot, yellow sticker for on-street, so that sticker program is already in place. Next slide. Here's the history. I know we could probably add a few more slides to specific select board meetings, but, again, this came out of articles that were presented back in the 2021 town meeting by an individual, Sylvia Dominguez, from Precinct 4. Mr. Diggins and I ran two forums, one on June 23rd, 22, the other one February of this year, and then discussions at numerous select board meetings, and in the interest of time, we've taken that out. Again, this is just for the, more for the public's benefit, because I know my colleagues are aware of the comment that we had. This was our actual language when we basically said we're not going to recommend any action on resolutions that were presented back in 2021, but we're committed to further discussion of potential pilot programs, and, boy, we've held that commitment for the discussions. So, after numerous discussions, after feedback that's been given to Mr. Diggins and myself and from members of the board at meetings, we've had discussions with Mr. Pooler, we've had discussions with Chief Flaherty, Mr. Rademacher, we've had discussions with residents. This is what we're proposing for the board's consideration tonight. And this is a program that originally we talked about six months, but where we are in the year, it's a program that would begin August 1st and run until the end of the year, December 31st. It would allow for up to 125 permits town-wide. The permit would allow for parking in front of or adjacent to the permit holder's residence. We did receive a lot of feedback from people who were just concerned where the parking would be allowed. No more than one permit per household and no more than two permits per property. We have another series of... aspects to this too, the cost would be a dollar a day. And on top of being able to park in front of your house, every permit holder would receive an assigned space in a municipal lot in the event of a weather emergency. The applications are to be submitted to the select board office, and upon approval of the application, payment is to be made to the treasurer's office. I believe we have the draft application, and I apologize this is a little small, but again, thanks to Ms. Maher for creating this. This has the basic information, what we're asking for or what we're proposing is that an applicant put the reason for the request to. A reason isn't required the way what we saw this evening or under some of our other programs, but we felt that if we could hear from the public in terms of why they're asking, it may help us, guide us to make changes or make further consideration of our parking policies. So that's the form there. At the end of the pilot period, what we're proposing is that we consider whether to amend the parking rules and regulations on a permanent basis in light of the demand, resident feedback, town department feedback, and other relevant factors. And I'm talking to Mr. Diggins, while we'd like to do this as quickly as possible, we're looking at a time period between January and March of 2024. If we are able to gather information ahead of time to get to the board, great, but that three-month period we would use to gather feedback and just see how much interest. And we selected 125 out of concern just in terms of how the select board office here in terms of the demand and what they would be able to handle what we have for stickers. And just to see, because we did receive a lot of feedback about concern that people, I think a number of residents didn't want us to just do this town-wide with an unlimited number. And this is a way to see, okay, what is the demand here? And what can we look at over the next few months and hear back from people? And I know Mr. Diggins, if you want to add anything to what I presented here. No, no, thank you. So there's the edit of the policy, which you can see, there was one thing I wanted to add, and that is, whatever we decide, I need to really edit that policy more. I mean, I tried to limit it to the overnight parking stuff, but as I read through it, there's just formatting issues and some other things that are outdated or confusing. So I think we really need to revisit that parking policy, whether we do the overnight parking or not. If we decide to do the pilot, then I'll do that revision at the end of the pilot. If we don't, then I'll do that revision sooner. It's a revision sooner. So that's it. I'm sorry, Mr. Chair, one other thing, and Ms. Marr, if you could put up the statistics again on the three categories, because the 125 permits, they would be inclusive of permits that are issued for municipal lots for those people who want to, who are in a municipal lot, who would want to park in front of their home. I will say a number of those permits, it probably isn't possible, because up at Drake Village, for example, there are spaces assigned, and it's a private, Drake Road's a private way anyway. So that's included in the 44, but the second and third categories, the on-street permits and the hardship exemptions, those would exist. They would be in addition to the 125. So those two categories would not go towards the 125 in our proposal. In theory, some of the 44 could. Can I just ask, so are you saying that the 44 municipal lot permits would be converted to also giving them permission to park in front of their house just to keep that consistent, because the cost is the same? Yeah, and again, the 44 in the municipal lot, it's really providing a reason other than you don't have room. So it's not so much to keep the cost, but I think there are some people who have asked for that, that if the pilot were available, they'd ask to park in front of their house. There are others that aren't going to have a choice, but I think for those that do have that option, I think we make it available to them because it's the same price. So that it would be, 150 would include, we would take the 44 off the top for the pilot? Well, for those within the 44 that want to convert, we would take it off the 125. And I will tell you, I don't know how many less it is. I know it might even be half that number because of the herd field parking. Yeah, 125 minus 44 minus X. I had some other stuff, but I usually go last, so I jumped in a little bit. I'll turn to my other colleagues. For approval? Yeah, we have a motion for approval.   
   
   
Mr. Hurd   
   
I don't want to let my brain start making revisions. I think we've been through this. No, I think this is a reasonable result of our many discussions, and I want to thank Mr. DeCourcey and Mr. Diggins for what I can only imagine was many, many, many hours of hard work on this. So I think at this point, we've got to just take a look at what we have in front of us and see how it goes. I think this is something, I appreciate the work that's gone into this. I think through our courses of our sincere compliance with their promise for discussion. They've done that before. I've had a number of concerns. I appreciate the distance we've traveled to address many of them, and this is something I'm happy to support. I have still reservations, but I think I'm comfortable that this is a relatively modest number. I think I'm comforted by the statistics that Mr. DeCourcey and the team and Mr. Diggins put together that shows that this is likely to be something that could be utilized, spread out perhaps a little bit across town. So I think it dilutes some of the concerns I had. And I think it's worth a try. One recommendation I would make is that we are absolutely clear with people that this is not guaranteed to continue. And I don't know if we want to issue advice along the lines of don't buy a car, just thinking that you'll be able to do this. But I think that that is something that we should contemplate in our messaging. That at least from my point of view, when we go to evaluate this, if this creates substantial problems in neighborhoods, I'm not sure yet. I don't know. And I think that's the purpose of the pilot. So I'm happy to do this as an experiment. I think you've made a good case for that. But I really would encourage anyone taking part in this to understand that this is an experiment and it is by no means guaranteed that we would keep doing it or keep doing it in its current form. Because I think my biggest concern with this all along has been that once you start this, it's really difficult to put the genie back in the bottle. So I'm kind of drawing that line to say that this really is an experiment. So with that, that's all I've got.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Mrs. Mahon did you have anything?   
    
##### Mrs. Mahon   
   
I'm just going to be really brief because I feel like we're on a broken record over and over and over again. I'm going to vote no, and I feel bad about doing that because I do respect the time and energy in meeting after meeting that Mr. DeCourcey and Mr. Diggins and the previous chair, Mr. Diggins and current chair, Mr. Helmuth, have really dedicated to this issue and making sure we hear all parts of it. And the only, not the only, but one of the main reasons why I'm voting no on this is sort of could be a reason why I should vote yes, which is what I'm hoping at the end of this process that after the information is compiled, and it's on one meeting, that we perhaps do some modifications, amendments, et cetera, to our policy when they come before the select board. And the reason I'm voting no is the reason we started down this road was from a town meeting member who said I have a financial hardship when you're talking about socioeconomic fairness and equity. The parking program doesn't address that. And what we have before us still doesn't address that because we're not really giving out permits, waiving every 125, nobody has to pay for it because they have an economic issue. And that's why, only because in terms of what we've heard quasi from our Transportation Advisory Committee from Clean Energy, Net Zero, et cetera, moving forward, I think this pilot program is really speaking more to people who have a third, fourth, fifth car and are looking for it to go somewhere. But I do appreciate the fact it's only 125. I do fear that where it starts a neighborhood issue in terms of, and I hope it doesn't, but I'm not gonna go any, so I'd like to see what comes out of the pilot. I think what we need to do is keep our big girl, big women and big men britches on when we go forward because I don't think this is a town-wide solution. I think that flies in the face of a lot of decisions, policy committees, subcommittees, MBTA, Alternative Transportation, the environment, Clean Energy, to talk about a way that everybody can park everywhere in Arlington overnight and I think it flies in that. But I'll be interested to see what comes out of the pilot program. But really, I think we need to get back. I think this kind of, we got down this road because we didn't want to make some hard decisions with what's before us. And if those decisions are just too hard and too rigid, then after this, we'll get the information and maybe we add one or two more exemptions. So thank you. Sorry for going so long when I said anyone else. Yeah, I was just going to, I keep forgetting about my microphone. So it's starting in about a month. Do we have a plan for when we're publicizing how somebody applies? Will we have a limited amount? How to get the word out to the public what the application date is and how one should apply just so nobody says, hey, I didn't get 125 given out and nobody told me how to do this? We don't have a plan yet. But with the go ahead to do that, I will then talk to the town manager to see how to go about doing that effectively, hopefully using Ms. Roman and work with Ms. Meyer to capture message me. But it's always been a matter of not trying to get ahead of where we are. So I did some preliminary work in order to determine that APD wanted us to have stickers as opposed to placards. And then Mr. DeCourcey carried that forward to find out where we were. So the short answer is no. Okay. A short answer and a long answer. Well, I just thought you'd sum it up. But also if I can, Mr. Chair, I just wanted to add that with respect to the economic hardship, there is that people can get these permits for free if they, just like they do on the municipal lot now, if they are supplied the necessary information to the select board's office. And so it is on a first come, first serve basis. But in many discussions with Mr. Hyman, maybe I just didn't interpret things correctly, and he can correct me, is that we have to create policies that apply to everyone in town pretty much equally. And so at least give them equal opportunity to do it. If we are able to do sections of towns with certain policies, then I would say, let's have at it. That's not how I came away about this. I can be incorrect, but if you want to bring this to light. Thank you.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Sure. Any further discussion? I believe I need a second on that motion, unless I had forgotten. Nobody's seconded yet. No, we have a motion from Mr. Hurd. Second. Okay. And Mr. Hurd, just to clarify, your motion is for approval of the program, but we're not going into the approving the red line added to the parking regulations tonight. Is that correct? Correct. And that's okay with you, Mr. Diggins? Sure. That's what you asked for, I think. All right, so on a motion to approve the plan by Mr. Hurd, seconded by Mr. DeCourcey. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? No. We have, yes, of course, we have a four to one vote. Thank you very much. Thank you, gentlemen, for your work.   
   </summary> </details>
<details><summary>Override Vote   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Now we have item number 21, final vote overriding commitments. Two reasons for this item. The first one is that the commitments have been updated slightly to add the additional line that Mr. Hurd requested, and I ran the language by him informally, so you see that before you, that makes a commitment that we will ask the town manager to work with department heads to continually look for efficiencies with the budget. And second reason is that when we took the first override vote, Mr. DeCourcey was absent due to illness, and this is a really important statement of recommendation to the voters, and I wanted to give the board an opportunity to have a vote with all five members, so I'd like to suggest respectfully, begging the board's indulgence, that we do the vote again to authorize the override, just so we can get all five members on record. And my traditional, our traditional person to read these complicated motions is Mrs. Mahon, but I know that you usually have these in paper in front of you. Do you have a iPad ready to read the different sections of the override? No, I don't. Okay, that's fine. Would you like to do it, and I'll say that's my motion?  Do you have it? I do, and I will. Oh, thank you. That's good, because by all rights, we rely on Mrs. Mahon for these, for this. So we have two motions, and this will become the final official vote of the select board on these. So we have a motion first to hold a special town election on Tuesday, November 7th, 2023, and the second motion will be to approve the override local ballot question. So the first motion, calling an election, that we move that the following questions be placed on the November 7th, 2023 special election ballot as, oh, sorry, I got ahead of myself. So motion that the town shall hold a special, number one, town shall hold a special election on Tuesday, November 7th, 2023, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. for the purposes of voting on a Proposition 2.5 override question to be approved by the select board in a timely written notice of such election shall be directed to the town clerk in compliance with the Mass General Law, Chapter 54, Section 42C. That's Mrs. Mahon's motion. Do I have a second?  Second. We have a second by Mr. DeCourcey. So on a motion from, no, Mr. Hurd. Trust me. It's my carbon vote. We're giving you a hard time, Mr. Former Chair. Oh, you gave me a hard time. I didn't notice. We have a motion from Mrs. Mahon, a second by Mr. Hurd. All in favor, please say yes. Aye. Opposed? It's a five, zero, unanimous vote. We both have blue shirts, so. Oh, yeah, so the confusion is obvious, right? It's interesting that you're sitting on different sides of me. In the second motion, the following questions shall be placed upon the November 7th, 2023 special election ballot as follows. A, Proposition 2.5 override. Shall the town of Arlington be allowed to assess an additional $7 million in real estate and personal property taxes for the purposes of funding the operating budgets of the town and the public schools for the fiscal year beginning July 1st, 2024?  Yes or no? Mrs. Mahon, that is your motion? Do I have a second?  Second. You have a second. So we have a motion by Mrs. Mahon, a second by Mr. DeCourcey. All in favor, please say aye. Aye. Opposed? It is a five, zero, unanimous vote. Thank you for your indulgence. I am glad to have all members of the board on record for this really important recommendation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, members. Is there any comments? I appreciate being able to vote again. As the chair said, I wasn't able to be here on June 5th, but I think with the commitments, with everything that we've done in long-range planning in terms of laying this out, we're at that point where, unfortunately, it's necessary to ask the voters, and I think we have the reasons. We've done our work. There's been a number of months of a lot of good discussion among stakeholders, and I'm comfortable with the work that's been done and the requests that's being made. Thank you, Mr. DeCourcey. We're glad that you can join us.

<details><summary>Announcements   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Okay, that brings us to board and staff announcements. Ms. Marr. No board announcements. Attorney Heim. None, thank you, Mr. Chairman.   
   
##### Manager Pooler   
   
I have a couple, thank you. First, I know it's been a matter of interest on a lot of members on the board. The premium pay that we made to our workers who worked during COVID, one group that did not get covered in that were people who had retired during that period, but had worked some of that time. We've looked at the numbers, and I can say tonight that we will be able to make those payments to those retirees. I'll be also working on other revisions to the current plan, which I'll present at the July meeting, but I just wanted you to know, and I've already informed some of the retirees that we will be moving forward in that direction. The second thing I just wanted to mention is I would just show you this picture. I don't think you can see it on TV, but we have started replacing our parking meters today. It's been a long, bumpy road, but we do have new meters. They are smaller than the other ones. They will, where there had been two heads on some of these posts, and now it will just be one, and you will have to pick A or B, left or right, but they are being installed, and we think that then by after the 4th of July, we will then have them in effect. So, if everything goes smoothly, and we will certainly publicize that. Those are the two things I wanted to mention. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Pooler.   
   
##### Mrs. Mahon   
   
Well, I have to say, ever since the Chair renamed new business to board and staff announcements, Mr. Pooler is, I don't know what we're going to do. This was a great time. Every time we have a patrolman contract settled, or we have the COVID retiree money, but I don't, well, kidding aside, I do appreciate, I know that every member of the board has certainly weighed in on this previously with Mr. Chaptolaine, and unfortunately it fell, or fortunately, in Mr. Pooler's lap on his platter to address, thankfully it didn't take you three years, and so I'm happy to have a resolution to that tonight. It's sort of, I have one other piece, but this is a segue into that. I did have a conversation very briefly with the town manager about something I brought up the last meeting and at the last quarterly report by Mr. Pooler and Ms. Cody regarding the OPRA funding, and I know that that's something that was in the mix, but wasn't the only thing at the front of the line. Kind of is now with a contract with a patrolman being settled, now with the COVID employee reimbursement, but I was speaking to Mr. Pooler saying one of the reasons I was concerned about is, you know, hearing and reading, hearing stuff out of Washington, D.C., reading the U.S. Treasury Department regarding OPRA funding and the federal government looking at those monies. I'm very comfortable with the town manager's former role as a deputy finance director, along with Powers and Sullivan for what the U.S. Treasury guidelines were for auditing and reporting, but then there had been discussion, and I'm not caught up as Mr. Pooler is, on what's happening down in Washington, D.C., but I know there was some kind of serious discussion and some print regarding Congress and others looking at OPRA funding and perhaps auditing it and asking for some of it back, whether you had allocated and didn't spend it or for a whole other myriad of reasons, but the town manager informs me, yes, that was discussion and nothing's a given, but I probably shouldn't have that concern at the top of my head. So I did say to Mr. Pooler, but it's up to the chair, but whenever those, I don't want those important figures, and I understand it's a coordination with the finance department in Arlington, with the comptroller and with Powers and Sullivan, take whatever time you need, because I don't want somebody rushing that I cause a mistake. And then my other piece of new business, which I'm going to ask the board administrator, Ms. Marr, to email out tomorrow, I was going to say, please forward to my colleagues as an FYI, I'll be bringing this up under board announcements, but then I said, no, that kind of seems like a violation. So, although if you're on one of the Arlington lists, you kind of have a sense of it. I did, how do I say it briefly?  Lots of complaints about yard waste. We heard at a town meeting from Mr. Ward and we've heard it from others. It really seems to, whenever there's a holiday, that really seems to throw everything off. But yard waste is, you know, some people are two, three weeks behind. Had gotten some public Arlington list responses, but also some private ones. So what I did was, just because I wanted to, I compiled, and I'm going to smile forward to my colleagues tomorrow, especially the people who said the second, third week that yard waste hasn't been picked up. Just compiled it and sent it to the town manager and to the assistant town manager, Mr. Feeney. A list of all those streets, when they've been out, and my new business would be, I've had a conversation with one member of the board, crazy as it is, with Mr. DeCoursey, also with Mr. Feeney. I understand it's Republic. I understand the contract's coming up within a year and a half or so. And I understand there's limited choices that we have out there. But especially with an override coming up in whatever lays down further on down the road, one of the things I've asked Mr. Pooler and Mr. Feeney to look into is, I've gotten comments that when people contact, right now what they're saying is, hey, I pay my taxes, I expect trash. When I call the town, they say it's not us, it's Republic, call this number. I think there needs to, whether that's actually the response, we need to do a better job of something else. And then it's been reported to me that, and I'm sure my colleagues, that when you call that number after Friday, you don't get anyone after 5 p.m. until Monday morning. That's not acceptable. And I understand we can say, well, Republic's just not doing that job. Well, then we, the town of Arlington, in my opinion, need to look at that and try to figure out a way. And one of the things I would say is, and this may be being done, but just me going through the exercise, you'll see the number of streets. I didn't include the people's names, but I have them who reported each of their streets. So it's not just like I went out and said, and I can forward that. And they're already out there on a public list. But I'd like to see a different response from the town. I'd like to see, I understand the override and where the monies are allocated and where it's going to, but I have had conversations, including with Mr. Pooler. Thank goodness we didn't have a heavy winter, because we really would have been in trouble. The 16 or so vacancies we have on public works, you know, everybody who wants organic fields and everything else, if you don't have the people there to do this. Now this issue with trash and yard waste. It may be it is what it is. And when we go out with a new contract, we get stuck with something that's going to give us lackluster service. But I really think the town needs to explore what's going on with Republic. Because this isn't a month thing. It's been since they've had the contract, pretty much. I know, and I think you all know. So whatever suggestions we can get from the town manager on that. But also, as long as it's not too cumbersome or exhaustive of an exercise. If there's something, I said this to Mr. DeCoursey, and he didn't hang up the phone. And if he was laughing at me, he put himself on mute. But I said, to me, one of the biggest things the board did, which I wasn't on. It was a pre all of us, was to privatize the trash. We lost all those pocket field DPW workers. We lost all our drivers for snow plows for winter. And we got stuck with this trash situation. So I'm not saying the town should take back doing trash. Because we just don't have the employees and have the infrastructure, the equipment to do that. But I have spoken to Mr. Pooler and Mr. Feeney. And now all of you, not just Mrs. DeCoursey. Just to kind of keep it out there that when we're talking about mission and goals and moving forward. Maybe there's an in between scenario. But I really want to get a handle on this response. Even if the response from the town is similar to what I did this weekend. And I literally spent the whole weekend. You'll see the list. And got the information and tried to organize that it was readable. Maybe that's what the person who works for us does. Even, you know, and then stays in touch with those people. Because I said, please let me know. And a lot of that list got cleared today. And it wasn't because of me. It's because I also said, please call Republic and put that in. But I'll stop there. Thank you. That's my other new business that we really need to think about. Our trash contract and everything else I said. Thank you.   
   
##### Mr. Helmuth   
   
Thank you, Mrs. Mahon. Mr. Hurd, any announcements?   
   
##### Mr. Hurd   
   
I have no new business. I'll just say I'm glad to see the meters going in. Because I had a client today that came in and asked me why some meters work and some don't. And I said, they're actually not enforcing them right now. He's like, well, I just put four quarters in them. I was like, oh, I'm sorry. Can I get my quarter back? Maybe you should have told clients when they went into. So it will be good for more equitable enforcement of our parking policies. We appreciate all contributions.
