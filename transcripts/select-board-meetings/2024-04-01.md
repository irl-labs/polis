<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 1301</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. I'm calling to order this meeting of the Arlington Select Board on April the 1st. I am Select Board Chair Eric Helmuth. It was not an April Fool's prank that we had some technical problems this evening getting the meeting going with our Zoom connection. So I'll explain what's going on for people who are in and observing on Zoom. Our ACMI has told us that the broadcast is functioning as normal. The individual Select Board members and key staff are logged on with our computers over Zoom when we're logging on. So we can hear people from Zoom in the room and I just realized. All right. Hold on. Hold on a second. So Sean I'm having to mute myself and I'm just now getting feedback when I unmute my laptop. So this is a problem. Testing 1, 2, 3. Maybe he'll come up. Sean if you can hear me give us advice over the speaker or come on up. Testing again. OK Sean. So whenever I unmute myself in Zoom. Is it this room? Is this room? Is there any way to just get rid of that and essentially have a Zoom meeting where we're all sitting here. These folks go up to this laptop. Everything else is just working through the computers. But then like you shut that off. Can't we all then now just turn our volumes up a little bit so we can hear on our. Yeah I think we could. It's worth testing. We'll see. We could get audio feedback problems with you know with individual speakers. As long as we don't crack the volume on just one central laptop. But feedback is from a microphone right? Well feedback is from individual laptop mics picking up the sound from another person's computer. Making matters worse my Zoom connection just went down. It goes it flakes on and off anyway normally. It's just a function of this laptop I think. So I'm not currently on Zoom. Of course it usually reconnects but. OK. Hi this is Chair Eric Helmuth and if somebody in Zoom can raise their hand. We're having some obviously having some major technical problems with their Zoom connection tonight. Someone in Zoom can raise their hand if you can hear me. Looks like we have everybody raising their hand. OK good. Thank you very much. Now let's promote somebody just as a test. Maybe Representative Garmelie. Actually you know what I'm just going to allow him to talk so because I think I'm a co-host. Representative Garmelie can you hear me? Here he comes. Hey Representative Garmelie can you help us out here and let me know if you can hear me and you can try talking. I can hear you Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? OK now I'm going to turn on my speakers. I'll try again Sean. I can hear you Mr. Chairman. OK now so we have some. I think we need to pick a laptop to have one laptop to have the sound. So yeah we're going to get the thing. Yeah I'm going to turn my speaker all the way down. All right I'm off. I can hear you. All right thank you. Sounds like there's some sort of feedback. No? And I think the the feedback was because my I had my mic on and it was picking you up a little bit so even from that distance it's it's feeding back. They're very sensitive. How about now? Can you still hear us? I can hear you. Can you guys hear that loud enough? Ask me if you can hear me. Sean are you able to hear the chairman? I'm a little faint. And I can hear you perfect Ashley. OK. Are you muted? So we have to unmute every time you want to talk. All right so I'm I'm testing now. This is the problem. Could I just sit here? What about that one? What about if I made that one the one that talks and speaks and that way I can toggle you guys? No? Oh you probably can't hear me. You just unmute and you can talk. Let's do the best we can. Let's go. All right we're just going to try to see what happens. So this is Chair Eric Helmuth. We're obviously having some technical difficulties with the Zoom. We're going to try this and see how it goes. What we've had to do this evening is the room Zoom connections off. So a bunch of us are on Zoom. You can unmute that while you're talking. Yeah no but I just got muted. We just need to mute the machine. You're unmuted Mr. Chairman. You're unmuted. OK I'm back. So each individual members and staff are on Zoom and we're trying to figure out how to do this without faulty feedback. Please stand by. I don't think there's any way around that. I don't think there is. I don't think we want this speaker on right now. You don't want this speaker on when someone is Zooming. Yeah so if you turn that speaker down. Did you turn the speaker off there? Yeah I used the wrong word. OK so when I go back off on Mike. So Sean's in the meeting now so we won't hear him unless that speaker's turned back up or I suppose mine is. That's the only way we're going to get a Zoom participants audio into this room. OK all right. I think we have Mr. Chairman. Thank you Mr. Chair and that's fine as long as the public can hear what's going on in this room. So maybe as you begin your introductory remarks Mr. Chair if you could just confirm if members of the public could just raise their hand to confirm that they can hear you and hear us that would constitute adequate alternative means for the public in terms of accessibility of this meeting. We should test it every time we have someone up there. OK yeah we'll do a good test. All right I think we have a plan and we'll go forward the best we can. Tonight's meeting is I guess first I'll just double check to make sure that the people on Zoom can hear me. So if John Alessi you're on Zoom right now if you're able to hear me would you raise your hand. Great. Thank you sir. OK. So this meeting is being conducted in the select board chambers and at least to some extent over Zoom as best we can is being recorded and simultaneously broadcast on ACMI. You can find if you're on Zoom or on ACMI you can find the posted agenda items on the town's website specifically the select board agendas and meeting and minutes page. And we have a makeshift Zoom solution right now. If any point that fails we'll make a decision here in the room. We do have a quorum of select board members. We can continue the meeting but I think we will be sensitive to the fact that we've advertised a public hearing and we want to make sure we will prioritize including having to reconvene if needed to make sure that the public does have a chance to participate. I guess I'll say this that because these are public hearings and warrant articles and it's very important we'll give this the best go that we have. And you know as long as I am confident Attorney Cunningham is confident that members of the public can fully participate over Zoom we'll proceed. If at any point it becomes clear that we can't I think I will suggest that we adjourn and we'll reconvene at another time. Does that sound good to you sir?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham and Eric Helmuth - 408</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes Mr. Chair. Thank you. Just pursuant to the old meeting law the public has to have the opportunity to participate both hear and speak if if allowed by the chair on these matters before the board tonight and as long as they're able to do that that constitutes adequate alternative means and that would satisfy the old meeting requirement the meeting could proceed. And was you were you unmuted on Zoom at the time when you were just speaking? This is the way I'll get used to this. That would be a negative. You might want to try that again just so we can get that ready to Zoom. So for select board members and staff when you want to talk we'll just unmute ourselves at our laptops. I think I'm unmuted now Mr. Chair. Yes you are. As I mentioned under the open meeting law it's required that the public have adequate alternative means to participate in tonight's meeting because this was advertised as a hybrid meeting by the select board. So as long as the public can hear what's going on where all the speakers can be heard clearly by either Zoom or phone or any other alternative means and they can participate if called upon by the chair then the requirements of the open meeting law have been satisfied and this meeting can proceed. Thank you very much. Are we allowed attorney Cunningham are we allowed to unmute yourself? Attorney Cunningham are we allowed to monitor the chat function in Zoom as long as we're not participating I guess? I have chat. Well I'm just I have it open here and if someone can't if I'm speaking someone can't hear me they get to say can't hear you. It's disabled. I wonder if I can Mr. Chair if I may. Yes sir. I would it'd be preferable if the chat preference chat option were disabled and if the individuals in the listening public wanted to speak perhaps raise their hand right and then at appropriate time could be recognized by the administrator and then considered for comment by the board. And I will note that we do we do have the Q&A enabled as well so we can monitor that which is a one-way communication. All right and I was able to I just kept my microphone on the whole time I don't know that that created problems so we might be all right.</blockquote>

That takes us to item seven appointments the council on aging we aging we have a Melissa McInerney and Dr. McInerney are you in the room or on zoom? If you are on zoom please raise your hand and zoom. Where is she exactly? I saw her to the left. Oh there we go. Good evening Dr. McInerney. Hi. Hi. So we're doing the best we can with our with our zoom but if you would just introduce yourself and say a little bit about your interest in serving.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Melissa McInerney - 223</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great my name is Melissa McInerney. I really welcome the opportunity to be considered to serve on the board for the council on aging. I'm an economist at Tufts and in my research I study what can help more older adults participate in the safety net programs they're eligible for and what the benefits of those safety net programs are and so I really welcome the chance to help adults in Arlington receive the benefits they're eligible for and I'm especially excited about this year's I guess launch of the new is it the property tax circuit breaker so I I'd love to find a way to move my research into practice in Arlington. Fantastic thank you very much. I'll turn to the board. I'd like to move approval and it's a little craziness from listening to our the feedback from our own voice but it is funny there's a number of volunteers on the town board. Economics professors at Tufts University and I was an economics major at Tufts University so it feels a little nostalgic but certainly have an amazing resume and and we're really happy that you stepped up and we're willing to serve this is a very important board that we rely on and you know help seniors across the town so thank you for your willingness to serve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I have I want to say thank you to Dr. McInerney really appreciate you taking on this position as well as your resume curriculum vitae that you provided us and one of the things that's really important similar to what what you brought up about tonight a Warren article that we're having to give seniors some relief but is the outreach and being able to communicate with our seniors who sometimes age is not the only communication path as we get older I can I won't go into my bursitis or anything like that but I do appreciate that that you definitely have a lot of experience with that putting aside grants and rent writing and all that and I know you'll be a good advocate for that I was just wondering if you had like three or four sentences in terms of talking to the the senior population perhaps what your style is or things that you know have worked or anything that you'd like to bring to the council. Sure so I look forward to learning more but what I would love to bring to the council is a willingness to listen and to see how I can help the particular angle I bring is an interest in the social safety net but I know the council on aging serves many, many functions. So I'm very open to learning how I can be most helpful. Did that answer your question? You know, you definitely. I mostly ask for people who are watching. They got a couple more, you know, a little bit more sense from you, and I look forward to your service on the committee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, that takes us to Traffic Rules and Orders, Other Business, Future Select Board Meetings. So we are now at the only we are just scheduled through next week, April the 8th. I believe that's right, Ms. Murr. That's correct. So April 15th is a holiday, but how about the 22nd? Because that's a holiday as well, right? That's why we're not starting town meeting. So any thoughts from the board? Anybody who might be chair in the near future? Let's see. It starts the 24th, right? Yeah, town meeting begins the 24th. I know that the 15th is the holiday week. I don't know if it makes sense to have something on the 17th. I don't know if there's anything further that we're going to need to do, but maybe there should be one meeting before town meeting. Yeah, I like the 17th. Would you prefer the 16th, Mr. Hurd? That's a holiday. The 16th is? The 15th is. I thought the 15th. The 15th is Patriot's Day, right? Definitely not the 16th. Not the 16th? So 17 looks good? I'll call it myself. It's scheduled for the 17th. I guess we're going to open up a warrant for special town meeting, right? So I imagine we'll have to do hearings for that, too. And you're currently muted, Mr. Diggins. Sorry. So while I was talking, I saw Mr. Hurd wave his hand. So did you want to say something, Mr. Hurd? No, I can't. So then how are we going to have the special town meeting? Because we're going to open a warrant for that. Well, I think we haven't gotten to that agenda item yet, which is next. But maybe we can take that up when we get to that. You know, just continue the discussion there. But that would influence when we would want to have our next meeting, no? Well, the special town meeting will be, I mean, if we do that tonight, as anticipated on the next agenda item, then we'd still want to meet on the 17th, right? Yeah, okay, right, right, right. So I was saying that would influence when we want to have another meeting. So definitely want to have one before town meeting, because we're going to have to discuss some items. Oh, and put something on the warrant. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, yeah. And we still have the 8th, correct? We have to meet on the 8th. We have to meet on the 8th, yeah. So we could do that. So we could do it then, right? Yeah. Mr. P? So with respect to the meeting on the 8th, what we were intending to propose on item 9 for not only a date for the special town meeting, but then in item 10 for the opening and closing of the warrant was intended to be on April 9th. So that would actually fall after the 8th. So I would recommend a meeting on the 17th, if possible. Yeah, so we definitely want one, yeah. So do we at least have three people who can meet on the 17th? I know myself and Ms. Mahan, Mr. Gorsy. Okay, so let's schedule the 17th and maybe talk about future meetings when we get to the 8th, when we're in a little better shape. And yeah, I think maybe next week we can look ahead to town meeting and figure out which days we want to meet early to get some business done.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 9</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    * Jim Feeney, Town Manager</blockquote>

Okay, so item 9, vote, special town meeting, date to be determined. Mr. Feeney, and unmute yourself, please.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 447</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. So before the board this evening on item number 9 is a request to consider calling a special town meeting this spring. This is necessary because the Attorney General's office has identified a procedural flaw that needs to be cured with respect to Article 12, the MBTA community zoning bylaw that was approved by special town meeting in October. So specifically the vote language considered by town meeting in October did not explicitly reference a zoning map that contained the multi-family housing overlay districts. The vote language referenced all of the associated textual bylaw amendments, but it did not reference amending the zoning map with Arlington's proposed Section 3A districts. Of course, the zoning map and the detailed parcel listings were included in the ARB's report to town meeting. However, they just were not referenced in the actual vote language. So it seems the AGO is rightfully scrutinizing to the letter of the law with respect to the MBTA communities bylaw, given the rise of litigation elsewhere and just wanting to ensure that everything is valid. So we are being asked to address this technicality with more specifically crafted language to accurately capture the vote for the record. We do not have to mend or make any adjustments to our districts, which were already deemed compliant by the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. So in regards to timing, a special town meeting can still happen within the annual town meeting, though it would not be practical to do so earlier than May 8th, which is the scheduled fifth session of town meeting. That was, of course, if the Board agrees to proceed in order to correct this issue that was identified. So while we work through these additional steps, the town and the Attorney General's Office entered into an extension of the statutory 90-day review period for that particular warrant article, which will now expire on June 22nd. I will note for the record that the fossil fuel-free demonstration pilot begins on May 21st, and our DOER, Department of Energy Resources, acceptance letter acknowledged that the town may need to address or would need to address any issues that arose with the passage of the bylaw. So we have notified DOER of this potential development and don't foresee any issues with respect to our participation in the pilot, and we have reached out to confirm that. So I believe that would be it for Article 9, and then obviously Article 10, if the Board does agree to move forward with calling a special town meeting, we could discuss the potential opening and closing date for the warrant. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 67</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's very reassuring to know that it's looking like this will not disrupt the fossil fuel pilot participation, which was why we queued this up for the timing in the first place. So if I understand correctly, you're suggesting, if the Board would want to do this, that May 8th would be the first opportunity to actually vote to hold a special town meeting on that date.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 66</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney Cunningham? Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, to effectuate this change that has been requested by the Attorney General's Municipal Law Unit, obviously this is a warrant article that would go before the ARB, and because of the timeline needed to advertise those hearings and to conduct those hearings, it really wouldn't be possible to include the special town meeting prior to the 8th of May.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eric Helmuth - 21</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got you. Okay, so I will turn to the Board for any discussion or motions. Mrs. Mahan, and unmute yourself, please.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCoursey - 72</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to second Mrs. Mahan's motion. But just maybe for the public's benefit, too, and Attorney Cunningham, if you can just confirm this, the reason on this why we want to have a special is that otherwise we need the special town meeting to open and close before June 22nd, and there potentially is a danger, although unlikely, that the regular town meeting could extend beyond that date. Attorney Cunningham?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 132</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's correct, Mr. DeCorsi, and thank you for making that clear for the public, and this time, I will say that in conversations with the Attorney General's office, as Town Manager Feeney indicated, they have found no fault with the district itself. They have indicated no concerns regarding EOHLC's determination that the district is MBTA community statute compliant. They're not asking us to take up any matters related to a revision of the district. This would simply be a warrant article to accept, to amend the zoning map of the town to include the district as was voted by town meeting, special town meeting last fall. So it should be a fairly procedural matter, but I want to stress that the DAG's office is not saying that our district itself is problematic.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 116</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just remind the board, as it knows, that for special town meetings, five days notice is required under pursuant to our bylaws, and the town meeting, the warrant for a special town meeting can be opened and closed on the same day. Thank you, Attorney Cunningham. So the implication of that would be, I believe Mr. Feeney has suggested April 9th as the day. Attorney Cunningham? Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, if the board is inclined, April 9th would work in terms of the timing required by the ARB to notice their hearings and conduct their hearings so that they could meet the May 8th special town meeting date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And I'm just noting, thank you to my Vice Chair, that Tom is a participant in Zoom, and this is not an item, it's a public hearing, but I want to be sensitive to any technical problems they may be having. So it looks like the hand is down, so I'll assume that we're all as well for now, and when we get to the public hearing, we will cover that. It's in chat. He wrote his thing in chat. He did write a question in the chat stating that people speaking should, who are not speaking, should mute following their comments. They're getting a lot of echo feedback. Thank you very much for that, Tom. So any speakers in the room, if you're not speaking, just mute yourself when you're finished. Thank you for that. And we will monitor the Q&A if any people in Zoom want to contribute information like that. We very much appreciate it. I have a display here. He's muted. So I think we're good to go. Okay. So at this point, I would entertain a motion for opening the special town meeting warrant. Mrs. Mahan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. This brings us to warrant article hearings. So I'm going to take a block of articles out of order and I'll explain what we're going to do here. We're going to take article 14 a little bit later. That's the bylaw amendment focused residence picketing. We have a block of three warrant articles, articles 20, 21 and 22. Those are home rule legislation articles. Because of my employment by the state legislature, I need to recuse myself from those articles so that for those next three, I'll hand the meeting over to Vice Chair John Hurd. And I would suggest to the incoming Vice Chair that he consider taking article 22 up first. That's the home rule legislation for lowering the voting age. The proponent is a high school student and this is literally a school night. And so that will be up to the Vice Chair, but that would be my suggestion. I think the other two articles are likely to be pretty swift. So we should get to article 14 in pretty short order following that. Good to go, Mr. Hurd. All right. I'm going to mute myself and leave the room. All right. All right. Following the chair's sage advice, we're going to take article 22 out of order.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sophie Shen - 1050</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, everyone. My name is Sophie Shen. I use she her pronouns and I'm a junior at Arlington High School. I'm here today to talk to you about warrant article number 22. Next slide, please. There are numerous reasons why we should consider lowering the municipal voting age to 16. Doing so can improve civic education, civic engagement and empower young people. This is an abridged version of the slideshow just so that our viewers know that we do have a full version on the town website already. If you would like to view the extended version. Next slide. So the first topic we're going to discuss is improving civic engagement. Studies show that voting is a habit and that once someone votes in one election, they're more likely to vote in a subsequent election. And so lowering the voting age can serve as a catalyst for increased voter turnout and voting. A higher turnout is better for our democracy because we get to hear a larger number of voices. And so if we encourage voting earlier on, then we'll see a pattern of voting emerge in Arlington voters. Next, next slide. We're going to now discuss strengthening civics education. Next slide. It is crucial to prioritize voter education in high school because after 18, students will go on to higher education and to the workforce with a full time job or whatever they choose to do beyond high school. And so reliable voter education becomes much more difficult. So Tufts University, which Mr. Heard has graduated from, has conducted several studies on voter education and voter turnout. And we found that black and Latin voters are least likely to be taught about registering to vote and encouraged to vote by high school teachers. And so particularly if we lower the voting age, not only will it improve education for all, but it will also help to promote diverse voices, which is really important when it comes to town measures. We want to encourage young people to get to the ballot box. Next slide, please. And our last main reason is to empower young people who are ready to vote. Next slide. Cold cognition is what makes up measured, deliberate, measured decision making. I'm sorry. And so the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is really what is responsible for what is called cold cognition. And so at 15 years old, it is basically formed and fully developed. And cold cognition capability does not improve in later years, which is why 16 and 17 year olds tend to score about the same as older adults on political interest and understanding. That's meaning that on a biological aspect, 16 year olds are ready. Next slide, please. So on a similar vein, society acknowledges that 16 and 17 year olds are capable and responsible. We are given the responsibilities of safe driving, working jobs and paying taxes, and in some cases even being tried as adults for serious crimes. And so if we give teens these such responsibilities, then I believe that we should allow them to also vote for a school committee to represent them. Next slide. So another common myth that I often hear is that young people are not interested in politics. Yet we see that some of the most popular extracurricular activities for high schoolers are Model Congress and Model U.N., which are inherently political. Personally, I participate in Harvard Model Congress every year, and they told us that this year has been the largest on. on record of student participation. We also see, I guess, in the real world, you could say, with protests that youth are highly active. For example, in the Vietnam War, the movement for peace was largely youth-led, and in the modern day, we see that climate activism is largely led by youth as well. Next slide, please. We also see that in Austria, whose voting age is already 16 years old, that when 16-year-olds are given the opportunity to vote, they take it. Their voter turnout is comparable to that of older adults. We see in this graph that the zero represents the average voter turnout, and that we see that there's a decline after a few years because between the ages of 18 and 25 years old, for example, there are major life transitions, such as going off to higher education or getting a full-time job, that make it a lot more difficult for voters to make it to the ballot box since voter registration is tied to an address. And we see that in the United States, we do struggle with the same problems of young voters from 18 to 25 years old tending not to vote as often as their older counterparts. So lowering the voting age, hopefully we would see the same trends that we see in Austria, where it would promote more voting and more civic engagement from young voters. Next slide, please. And the last myth that I want to go over today is that this is just an extra vote for children's parents. Yet we see that in studies conducted in Scotland, whose voting age is also 16, that this is actually not the case. Teens are equally likely to vote the same as their parents as they are to vote differently. Next slide, please. So finally, if we were to make moves to lower the voting age, we would not be alone. Within the state, Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville have already submitted home rule petitions, and we see within the country and worldwide that there have been other efforts to lower the voting age. As mentioned earlier, Austria and Scotland are among some countries that have a voting age of 16 years old for their federal elections. And Representative Sean Garbley is actually here tonight on Zoom. He pens the Bill H686, which would also do this on a state level. I'm sure he would be happy to answer any questions if you had any. Next slide, please. And so, thank you all for listening. I will now take questions if you have any. We can also reference the larger slideshow, which does have more facts and figures if you feel so compelled. I'm just gonna sit here with you so I can do this. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Ms. Chen, for all that hard work. Definitely appreciate it. I'm just wondering, not that I would expect it. This has happened already because you're just putting the proposal before us and then it has to go, if successful, to town meeting in the state house. But have you had any education or explanation amongst high school 16, 17 year olds, sort of an audience with them? Do you have any sense of if this is something that they're also kind of watching? And I say that in light of the fact that one of the things I, and myself, and my colleagues have been very encouraged by is especially the past few years, including this year, quite a few students from the high school and the middle school have participated in the Warren article hearing process with our fossil fuel Warren articles, with our ACE, community electricity program, rate setting articles. Not only have they been participated, I and my colleagues have been really impressed with a level of knowledge and understanding. They're not just coming in saying, I think this is a good idea, vote for it. They give us a little meat behind it and they're obviously aware of what's going on. So I'm just wondering if, A, you have a sense right now, not that you could speak for an entire community population, or B, if you haven't really done that outreach yet or what you anticipate in the future, if successful.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, so, oh, oh no, you're fine. Yeah, she just asked. Okay, sorry. Actually, the petition that I've collected signatures for largely was in part from teachers and also students who had recently turned 18. And so a lot of those students who signed my petition said that they would definitely support this measure. And teachers who have observed students working in the school environment have observed the same thing, that students are eager, they're ready, they have learned a lot thus far in their education and they have an eagerness and an understanding about politics that would be conducive to allowing them to vote at 16 years old. I also mentioned this in one of my meetings at MSCAN, which is Massachusetts Schools Climate Action Network. And that has been a very popular idea amongst the participants of that meeting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks so much, Vice Chair. I want to thank the board for taking me out of turn. Thank you, Sophie, for your inspiring presentation on this important issue. I also want to thank the other members of the board, including Member Diggins, who has worked closely with the panel on this issue as well. I rise in strong support of the Warren article. I try not to come to the board. I don't think I've come to the board in my 16 years of being your rep supporting a Warren article because I believe all of you are my colleagues. So I try not to go in front of you on specific issues, but I feel compelled to speak because it really is about a piece of legislation that I have filed for the past 10 years in the House of Representatives, which Sophie mentioned in her presentation, House 686, an act relative to age requirements and local elections. And I feel really strongly about this bill to make it statewide. I think Sophie really, in her arguments, she made a lot of important claims and pointed to many studies on why lowering the voting age is so important for municipal elections. For me, this is about creating engaged lifelong voters and you starting at the municipal level for school committee and local offices, a great way to create an engaged electorate, young people going as they get older. That's really, really important. As well as there's been at least 10 cities and towns that have filed similar home rule authorization to the state legislature. Like I said, over the last 10 years, from Cambridge to Boston to Lowell and out into the Western part of the state. And in trying to get legislation passed statewide, it helps me as a member of the House to be able to point to cities or towns that have supported this effort. And it helps me to make the argument that this is something that the people of Massachusetts want and gives me a better chance and an opportunity to be able to get this piece of legislation passed in the State House. So I strongly support this concept. I really appreciate the board taking me on a turn and I am grateful to Sophie for her outstanding work on this bill and this issue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, Mr. Chair, this is Chris Floretti. Can you hear me? I think it was you. I think it was me you may have been referring to. So Chris, are you on the Zoom in two places? Cause I see your name, Chris. I am because I'm not using it. Are you on the phone too? That's right. Cause I'm not using the audio on the computer. I don't have a microphone on it. Okay. Yep, Chris, you can go ahead. Okay, thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. And I'm frankly disappointed that your chairman recused himself because I really didn't think he needed to. But in any case, I think this article is a really bad idea. And I'd like to explain why. And I quote, the brain structure and function undergo considerable changes during adolescence. Adolescents are more vulnerable to irrational decision-making caused by impulsivity and reward or sensation seeking behavior due to their psychosocial immaturity. Children's brain regions connect to impulse control and emotional maturity are still developing according to research. Now, what I'm quoting there is by someone from the Youth Member Coalition for Juvenile Justice. And what I would say to your board, Mr. Chairman, is if juveniles and 16-year-olds are not prepared to accept the laws of adults and be treated as adults in the legal system, then I don't see why they should be giving the right to vote in town. And I heard the argument made that they pay taxes. Well, they may pay meals taxes if they go to Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts, but I don't think many 16-year-olds pay property taxes. And that's the principal tax in town. So I say no representation without taxation in Arlington. And I also take exception to the idea that this is not a political aspect or the political aspects of these types of votes and that they're not trying to support democratic candidates. And I would ask your board and the proponents to cite the number of cities and towns throughout the United States that are in red states that have enacted versus this type of legislation versus those in blue states. And I think you'll find overwhelmingly that this really is a political issue and a political ploy to elect more Democrats. So I hope you'll see through that attempt. And frankly, if students need better civics education to encourage them to vote, then that's a matter for the schools to address. I don't think it's something we should do by simply giving them the right to vote as minors. Thank you.</blockquote>

I just wanted to note that there is a draft motion in the material that's been provided to the select board and has been made available to the public. And I know it's in the title of the draft Warren article, but it's just stressed that this is for municipal elections only. This is not for state or federal elections for the public's clarification. And I also wanted to quick editorialize this. Commended Ms. Chen on her advocacy. She reached out to the legal department and was very strong in her, and provided materials that were very helpful in the legal department's analysis. So we very much appreciate it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Attorney Cunningham. And now I will turn to the board. Mrs. Mahan. Is that okay? All right, I just wanted to make sure. And I want to thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chair. I want to thank town council for pointing out that this is home rule legislation for 16 and 17 year olds for local elections only, which I think is the most appropriate for this type of initiative moving forward. And as I stated before, we've had over the past three to five years, especially the past two years, more and more increased, not just high school, which is 14 to 18, but also middle school students that have gotten involved, been civically engaged, and probably nine times out of 10, if not 10 out of 10, have spoken more eloquently than I have. So with that, I would like to move favorable action to file home rule legislation to lower the voting age to 16 in Arlington in local elections.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mrs. Mahan. Mr. Diggins. Thank you, Mr. Chair, Mr. Vice Chair. I'll second that. And I have a couple of questions, you know, maybe just one, you know, and I'm not sure to whom I should address this, this point, you know, I don't know if Rep Garbaly is still on. I need to unmute. Thank you. Thank you. So I know that Rep Garbally's legislation would make this automatic, I mean, upon approval by the legislature. It doesn't have to come back to the municipalities, you know, for an election. You know, when we discussed this, I think we could have gone one of two ways. You know, it's automatic if the legislature signs off on the legislation, or it could come back to the Arlington residents for a vote, you know. I guess I'll address this to Mr. Cunningham. Do you happen to know, I mean, if all the other HRs by the other municipalities were automatic, or did any of them?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham and ? Munson - 121</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Mr. Duggan, I think Attorney Munson is gonna take any questions on this article. Okay, all right. So sorry about that, you know, so. So do you happen to know if the other municipalities required that it be automatic, or that it come back to any of them for a vote by their residents? So I can speak to the home rule petition that was filed in Boston, and the intention for that was for the legislature only to make clerical or very minor adjustments, I guess. And as far as I know, none of the home rule petitions that have been filed have actually been passed yet. I think they're still with the legislature. Does that answer your question?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 17</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because the question is, do they require that the residents, or the voters vote to approve?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Munson - 47</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the legislature would pass it, but then it would come back to the voters. Oh, I see. Yeah. Do you wanna mute, so? Yeah, so now I understand. So again, speaking only on behalf of what I know happened in Boston, there was not that requirement.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 45</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the intention then would be when the legislature passed it and the governor signed it, it would take effect upon passage. So this is a little bit strategic on my part, but also trying to get a sense of where the legislature's head is.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Munson - 172</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my sense is that generally the legislature would prefer that the state be as uniform as possible. That's my sense. Certainly Representative Garberly can tell me if that's incorrect. The, I guess, somewhat unrelated is if Representative Garberly bill is such that it's automatic, I would be curious if we put one in that came back, required that it comes back to the voters, how the legislature would respond to that. So my suspicion is that this will have a hard time with the legislature because of my first statement, that is that they like everything to be uniform. So either they will probably just pass a Representative Garberly's bill or not pass anything. But if there is any sense on their part that they don't want to be forced in a municipality to do something, then if we've had in hours that it could come back to the voters, then it might increase the chances that if Mr. Garberly's bill didn't make it, being ours would stand a better chance.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 129</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to turn to Attorney Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Vice Chair. And just to respond to Mr. Diggins' question is, there would no, as currently constituted in the draft motion, there'd be no requirement that it come back to Arlington if it were passed by the state legislature. And although there's no way for us to know exactly what the state legislature is going to do, I think that Representative Garberly probably had it correct that even if this home rule petition were unsuccessful that Arlington files, it would be a demonstration to those in the state that the more communities that are filing these home rule petitions indicates a broader base of support and perhaps would help Representative Garberly in his pursuit to pass statewide legislation.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Len Diggins - 89</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understood, but having it be such that it would have to come back to Arlington residents, approval wouldn't signal anything negative with respect to Representative Garber-Dispel, right? So it's really a matter of whether we want it to come back to the Arlington residents or voters. I can appreciate wanting to just have it done, but as I said, I think it gives the legislature an option that they might find more appealing. So I just put that out there, it's something to consider, so that's all, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. DeCorsi. Thank you, Mr. Vice-Chairman, and Ms. Chen, thank you very much for the presentation. I will be supporting Mrs. Mahan's motion, and I think I want to address a couple things, but first of all, I think your common myth number one about the 16 and 17-year-olds, that to me is a strong argument for asking for permission, the town asking for permission for 16 and 17-year-olds to vote, the fact that 16 and 17-year-olds can drive. They can work jobs, some choose to and some don't, that's irrelevant, but you are working at 16, you're paying state and federal income taxes, and you're contributing to, I believe, Social Security at that point as well, and some of our aid comes from the state, so the fact that it's, whether it's property tax or not, is frankly for me irrelevant. It's really the fact that you're out there and you're following things, I think it's great at the local level, I look back, when I was 16, it was 1980, it was a presidential election, I know there's a lot of people, a lot of students focusing on elections, and I think that's probably the case this year, we're in a presidential election year, and as Mrs. Mahan said, more of our high school students, middle school students are engaged in local affairs, and frankly, above 18 and older, we haven't done such a great job getting out and voting either, when you see 20, 25% turnout at local elections, so I think for all those reasons, it makes good sense at the local level, I'm comfortable with, if town meeting goes along with this, petitioning the legislature not coming back, and having a vote on it, but I think it's also significant for the legislature to see how many towns are going to do this, because unfortunately, this is probably going to take a while, but as we see more communities maybe attempt to do this, maybe there'll be more momentum at the state level, it would be great if it happens right away, and I appreciate you bringing this forward, and all the work that you did, and all the materials that you provided that are available, both to us and to the public through our agenda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Corsi, Mr. Diggins, did you second the motion? I thought so, but I certainly wanted to, so thank you. All right, thank you for the presentation, when I first saw this, I had some concerns, but I think your presentation, for me, it was myth number three that addressed my concerns, and so you're certainly well prepared for what the concerns of the board was going to be, and I just thought that 16, 17 year olds, the parents have a fair amount of influence on what they do, and it could just be an extension of their vote, but you certainly came prepared with evidence to refute that thought, and at the same time, it will still be reflective of the general population, I guess, and you would assume that most kids vote the way their parents raised them, but it's not always the case, so I'm happy to support this, you know, I think this will further the conversation at the state house, the more towns, the citizen towns that pass this, and, you know, I anticipate it will still have an uphill battle, given the current votes on the home rule legislations that's been sent to us thus far, but again, it keeps the conversation going, and the more people that say, hey, this looks like a pretty good idea, the more likely the legislature is to move and come around on it, so thank you for your work, hopefully you don't have too much homework to go home to, but we, thanks for sticking in with us tonight through, usually our meetings are much more efficient than this, so you can come back to another meeting when we're working a little smoother. So with that, I believe we're ready for a motion, unless there's any final discussion. We have a motion for favorable action by Mrs. Vahan, seconded by Mr. Diggins, all in favor say aye. Aye. All that are opposed. That is a unanimous vote. Thank you. Mr. Diggins. Mr. Vice Chair. Yes, Mr. Diggins. Okay, I just see a few words about this article.

Yes. Yeah, so I just wanted to say that, you know, I was truly impressed working with Ms. Chen, you know, so she brought this article, the idea up, you know, and initially me thinking about what we'd seen on some of the polls, you know, I was hesitant, just personally, you know, I would not have moved something like this, you know, on my own, but I just wanted to be supportive, you know, and she, I thought, made a really good case and the caliber of work that she did was really very impressive, you know, and so, if there's just one person that deserves to vote at a younger age, it would be Ms. Chen, it would be worth it just for that, but I've also worked with a lot of other youth and young adults in town, and so she's not unique, you know, not only in Arlington, but also just all over, I mean, and so it's really good to see, you know, youth and young adults really trying to get more involved, and so I'm glad we did this, and I didn't want to like try to push the agenda too hard or push the motion too hard earlier on, so I just wanted to save it for now. Thank you. All righty. Ditto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Vice Chair. So, this is a home rule petition for, to ask the town, for the select board to ask for authority from the town for you all to file a home rule petition to convert the elected town clerk position to an appointed position. There are other municipalities that have done this before, not just for the town clerk position, but for the collector-treasurer, for example, in Westwood. Both Wenham and Rutland have had home rule legislation actually signed by the governor this year as special acts doing the same thing, and so there is some draft vote language and a draft home rule petition in the materials for you. It's kind of a compilation of some of the different acts that have been passed. I will note that this question is going to be on the ballot, and so there will be a timing matter to make sure that the effective date that is in the home rule petition is going to obviously be aligned with any sort of elect ballot action. And I will also note, too, that the board should consider some bylaw amendments that also will need to happen to just make it consistent. And in terms of the particulars of the home rule petition, I think, you know, the home rule petitions give broad authority to legislative bodies to be able to be flexible with the type of language you want to include. It's sometimes better to include more particulars than not, such as, you know, who the appointing authority is going to be, whether it's a fixed term or serves at the pleasure of the appointing authority, any sort of duties you want to codify, and then in this particular matter, making sure that the current elected term of the town clerk is not cut short by the home rule legislation. So I'm happy to answer any questions that you have.</blockquote>

But to answer Mr. DeCorsi's question, I would say that, I mean, procedurally the board could take the approach of a will report, as it has done already this foreign article season, if it was inclined to allow the voters to consider this matter first at the upcoming town election, and then at a later date before town meeting, before annual town meeting, take some sort of vote regarding favorable action or some other action that the board wanted to take, it could do that as a procedural path forward.</blockquote>

I'm certainly fine with waiting in order to provide more detail. So if we weren't so close to the election, lots of early voting already, I would be inclined to flesh out as much detail as possible about this, because that to me makes the decision easier, and certainly the devil slash genius are in the details when it comes to something like this. But that's moot at this point. So I would say, with respect to town meeting, my inclination would be to provide as much detail as possible, because I enjoyed the process of thinking things through, but I could certainly hear the argument that that's still not enough time for us to think things through clearly, and I think that's the winning argument. So whatever amount of time and whatever venue we need to, or whatever manner we need in order to provide a really good set of details is what we should do.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just make one request to the board on this, and if you read the memo from Council that he sent on this article, he seemed to be suggesting that you can completely ignore the vote of the voters this Saturday on this question, and even if they reject the proposal to make the town clerk an appointed position, you can go right ahead and submit this home rule legislation to a town meeting, if you have permission, and the state legislature could approve the conversion of that position to an appointed position. I'm asking your board to disavow that claim. Frankly, I'm not sure it's right. Town Council cites towns like Wynnum that have done that without a vote like we're having on Saturday, but the town of Wynnum has an open town meeting, so the very same people that vote in the town meeting are the people who would vote on a ballot question. That's not the case in Arlington. Now, maybe you know why you were elected to your office, but I don't think I was elected as a town meeting member to disenfranchise the people in my precinct when it comes to voting for other positions in the town, so I'd like you to be very clear that you will not put this article forward unless the voters on Saturday approve the conversion of that position to an appointed office, and I think that needs to be made very clear, because I haven't heard any discussion or explicit discussion of that tonight, but that sure seems to me what Town Council was saying in his memo to you, so I would leave it at that. I think this is a question that needs to be left to the voters. I certainly don't support it, but I will respect their decision, and I would ask you to do the same. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much Mr. Feeney and now I will ask attorney Cunningham or town council to make additional comments Go ahead and unmute sir Thank you Mr. Chair, yeah just to further the discussion, yeah this was an important issue, obviously First Amendment concerns are something that are very seriously considered, subject to a heightened level of security for important reasons that we want to protect the people's right to speak and their First Amendment rights are not infringed upon, however there are certain instances and it's outlined in the memorandum that's been provided to the board and is available to the public on the select board's website the reasons why this particular proposed bylaw is legally permissible and does not violate the constitutional rights of First Amendment specifically as is cited in the memorandum, the Frisbee versus Schultz case, which is a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court case took on this issue, there was a community in Wisconsin that had a similar issue where they had individuals targeting residences, residents of in that case it was an abortion doctor groups of about 20 people, and the town enacted this type of targeted picketing residential ban the Supreme Court considered it and determined it was not violative of the constitution, as long as it's narrowly tailored, I would just highlight some of the language in the memorandum it is not facially invalid and is appropriate under the federal constitution if it's content neutral on its face, which this proposed bylaw is, prohibits only focus picketing taking place solely in front of a particular residence number three, leaves open ample alternate channels of communication for the dissemination of messages number four, prohibits the type of focus picketing which is fundamentally different from more generally directed means of communications that may not be completely banned in residential areas, and last is narrowly tailored to serve the significant government interest of protection of residential privacy, especially where the picking is narrowly directed at the household, not the public, and where, even if some picketers have a broader communicative purpose, their activities nonetheless inherently and offensively intrudes upon residential privacy so that was the significant governmental interest that the Supreme Court considered when it evaluated this particular ordinance from Wisconsin is that the individual in his or her home is unable to avoid this type of communication, and therefore it is not protected. I will note that the draft language that is before the board, if it is inclined to move this forward, is pretty much strictly taken from the Frisbee case and is the language that was approved by the Supreme Court, I think it was important to the extent that this board or town meeting is inclined to adopt this or move favorable action that we stick closely to that language because we know it's constitutionally valid I think a deviation from that language runs the risk of running afoul of the First Amendment rights that are so well protected.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you Mr. Feeney and Attorney Cunningham and Attorney Munson for the work done as well on the research, and for me, I am a neighbor of the governor, and I am aware of the protests that took place. I was there for one of them, and I certainly saw firsthand the invasion of privacy that takes place when you have targeted picketing. I spoke to a number of neighbors who were concerned, just as Mr. Feeney said, there was concern about the roadways and we received a number of inquiries about that, and we got through that, but I look at this as something, and we may hear from Chief Flaherty later, that there are state laws on the books for unlawful assembly. There's nothing at the local level, and this is something that we can do at the local level if we move favorable action to recognize that there is a significant government interest in protection of privacy in residential homes, and that's what this does. As I looked into this and learned more from Attorney Cunningham's research and my own research, the Supreme Court, as Attorney Cunningham said, in 1988 in its decision said that this is constitutional. In Massachusetts, Brookline has a focused residential picketing bylaw. The city of Boston has one, and just one comment in terms of one of the questions about whether this is narrowly tailored or not is there a possibility of putting time restrictions on this, and Brookline does not. Boston did. I will note that the two protests that made the news, one was at 6 o'clock, one was after 9 o'clock, and they were equally invasive, and so, to me, in order to make this narrowly tailored, it would have to be an outright ban, having seen the different times, because the earlier protest, in my view, shouldn't receive any additional or be excluded from this. I also just want to say, just as a matter of observing, what makes this constitutional, again, is the invasion and there's this concept of the unwilling listener. When you go home, you should be free from intrusions, and there's also a captive audience doctrine that comes out of this. Same concern, and for one of those protests, I could have left my house and left nearby, they could not have readily left with the protest, and that's where the constitutional protections really should come in, and I also will note that there is an impact on the neighborhood, people close by, and the constitutional analysis that Attorney Cunningham undertook were focused on the individual residents, but there is an impact on the neighborhood, and that was the reason why we got so many inquiries as well. It's just very unsettling for others nearby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm going to say some things in hopes that there will be responses in hearings when we hear from folks. I understand the concern. I definitely understand the concern. I'm going to give a hypothetical scenario that may seem a little extreme. Maybe I can get a response from my colleagues or Mr. Cunningham or Ms. Munson. Let's say the governor and the neighborhood is extremely homophobic. They see homosexuality as just morally repugnant, viscerally disgusting. You had people who, same-sex people who went and just did a kiss-in in front of the governor's residence. That's targeted. That would not be allowed under this, right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attorney Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's always dangerous to engage in hypotheticals. I'm sorry, Mr. Cunningham, if you would just unmute, please. Thank you, Mr. Chair. It's always dangerous to address hypotheticals in the legal analysis. However, I would suggest that it would focus on the fact that this is about every residence in town. This ordinance, because it has to be content neutral, it would apply to many things that involve unwanted speech when a person is inside their residence. I'd have to stress that. It's a town-wide ordinance that applies to every residence in town, if adopted, and that it would be any type of speech that constitutes picketing under the definition of picketing, whether it's one side of an issue or another. It can't be something that targets specific types of speech or actions of picketing. It has to be across the board. That's what makes it neutral. That's what makes it fair. That's what makes it constitutional. Another thing I'll say is that I guess I thought I unmuted myself. Sorry about that. Thank you. I appreciate that. The only way someone's going to get to me as a member of the select board other than email or phone call is to picket in front of my place. I don't work here. We have a select board office here, but we don't work here. I just have a hard time making it impossible for someone to get to me. I can appreciate the discomfort, but that's part of the purpose of protests. I would like to think that the state has put some bounds so that they can't do it after a certain time. They can't keep me up all night. I would imagine there are other restrictions. I don't know what they are. For it to just cut it off completely, I just have such a hard time with it. I just feel that I signed up for it. I know my neighbors didn't, but it is part of our system. I hear the other argument that I did not sign up for an invasion of privacy. I have a little issue with the notion of privacy, but I'm not going to argue with it too strongly because it seems like a settled law. To me, privacy is like you can't physically come into my space. The way I'm understanding it now is like you can't do anything that I can perceive that I don't like because that's an invasion of my privacy. Even though I understand that it's a settled law, I just have a hard time getting a yes on this. I've put my arguments out there. I welcome the counter arguments. Please bring me to your side. That's it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we'll go to Mr. Gorsuch. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the things, Mr. Diggins, is there are other alternatives to protest. Our colleague Mr. Helmuth is aware there are protests that take place daily at the statehouse outside the governor's suite and in front of the building. There could be protests here in front of town hall. The Supreme Court has said that the level is separate in terms of this right to privacy, particularly where the picketing is targeted and rises to a certain level. I think some of the questions you have were addressed in the Supreme Court decision in Frisbee of V. Schultz in terms of what would rise to that level. I think there is a clear distinction. The governor's office is not in our home or any individual official. Mr. Hurd could talk to an incident that he had at his home as well. That's a separate situation. We don't have a governor's mansion. We don't have something that's separate where there's office and home together. I think that's a ... I might be stepping over my bounds in terms of our two attorneys here, but I just see a difference here and maybe some additional discussion in terms of how that is flushed out and how it would be looked at and maybe as we go through this, maybe some information from Chief Flaherty from the calls that came in too in terms of ... or the nature of the protest that gave rise to this. I think there's a clear distinction.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. Ferdie Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And in response to Mr. DeCourse's comment, absolutely, the courts have clearly distinguished between places of business and places where people reside in the different levels of constitutional protections that afforded people when they exist in those two places. And I would just note that perhaps, and maybe this is helpful, Mr. Diggins, in response to the earlier question about particular hypothetical scenarios, but the definition of picketing as considered by the court in Frisbee was that, and it isn't very helpful, but defined as a posting at a particular place, and they cited Webster's Dictionary for that, but they considered that particular definition to be in line with the ordinance that was seeking to limit activity focused on a single residence. So with use of that language, hypothetically, any activity that's focused on a single residence in a picketing manor, posted in a manor, would be violative of that particular ordinance. And similarly, if enacted by the town of Arlington, it would be violative of this particular proposed bylaw.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. So, in the past several months, the Arlington Police Department has responded to three separate protests at the governor's house. The first protest was early in the fall. One moment. I think that computer is muted. Sorry. It's still showing it as muted. Do you see it differently on that? So, the first protest was early in the fall. It was... It's still showing as muted. Yeah. I'm sorry. We need to get that computer unmuted. There we go. It's good now. Good to go. All right. If you start over, please. Thank you for your patience. Sure. So, first protest, early in the fall. It was a planned protest. I believe the organizers had come before the board or had asked the select board for permission, and we were able to communicate with the organizers. It was very peaceful. The second protest was on October 14th in 2023. That occurred at about 9 p.m. This instant, there were 25 to 30 protesters who parked about a mile away from the governor's house, marched in formation, wearing military clothing, face coverings, hats, to the governor's house where they formed up in front of the house. They had flares. They were chanting. They had horns, and they were using obscenities to the police officers, to the residents who had come out, and after about 20 minutes, they dispersed. The third protest was on February 10th. That occurred at around 6.30 p.m., and that was very similar to the second protest where these 25 to 30 protesters marched from a different location to the governor's house where they lined up. Same type of behavior. They had flares. They had horns, and that protest lasted for about nine minutes. On both of those two separate protests, the Arlington Police Department received multiple 911 calls. We received multiple calls to our business line where people were in fear. We had people who were trying to leave their residence to pick up small children or teenage children. They couldn't get out of their driveways because the protesters were blocking. We had residents call the station because they were expecting people to come to their house, and the protesters were blocking the roadways. We heard from multiple residents after who really were in fear, and they had children who were traumatized, and it was a disruption to the neighborhood. Having this bylaw would certainly be a tool in our police officers' tool belt that they could use to ensure the safety of all of the residents of Arlington.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, and thank you to the town manager for submitting this warrant article. What I'm going to say, I hope, will make for a much stronger majority yes vote. In the meeting I attended for Len's meeting with town meeting candidates, the three other town meeting members, existing members, all were very opposed with a lot of reasons. I ask you to support the change to the bylaw. In addition, I ask you to support creating a resolution to justify the change based on the following kinds of ideas. Today's free speech policies are largely guided by the logic of the slippery slope, but violating the privacy and feelings of security of a private home is more a behavior, not speech. Free speech, in my opinion, must convey such things as ideas, information, argument, persuasion, and so on, where it does not qualify as speech. When speech crosses over into violating those feelings of privacy and security in a home, it becomes more a behavior, a domain that we may regulate. We've already had a town manager move out of town for reasons he openly discussed on ACMI. Must we continue to support free speech regulations that can make it necessary for a public official to move, or for anyone to move? Should we hear that we cannot vote a limitation on demonstrations in front of a private residence because the ACLU will sue the town? I predict the ACLU will not sue the town without being able to answer this request. Give us actual examples of diminished free speech caused by the slippery slope theory, such as, after we prohibited television advertising for cigarettes, did anyone argue for other forms of censorship because we cannot draw the line? We prohibit child porn. Have these prohibitions been used to justify other forms of censorship? Germany outright prohibits various forms of Nazi speech. Has it diminished in any way other free speech rights in Germany? Conversely, people in states like Florida are removing books from libraries despite our severe free speech protections, which begs the question, in what way does protecting the right of Nazis to demonstrate in front of a private home actually protect us from censorship? Perhaps existing policy in these times needs an update. We have three or four weeks to support the bylaw, the change that's been made, and write a resolution justifying the amendment. A good place to start is with Louis Brandeis's logic, where he recognizes that a right to privacy is embedded in the overall purpose of the Constitution. Sorry for the pronouns. Makers of the Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognize the significance of man's spiritual nature, his feelings, and his intellect. They conferred against the government the right to be left alone. To conclude, let's not allow the threat of a lawsuit to prevent us from having a town where people feel secure in their own homes, even in the midst of civic debate. Please support further work to create a better balance between free speech rights and the right to be left alone in one's home in a way that maintains our free speech rights. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Loreti - 508</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. Okay, let's now turn to Zoom, and I think we have Mr. Loredi on the phone that we can allow to talk. Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you hear me? Yes. Yes. Chris Loredi again. I guess I would like to say I find this article offensive in a number of ways. First, just procedurally, I know the town manager talks about people contacting him, and that's what prompted him to put this article forward. I'm not sure I completely believe that, and I think if individuals have these types of concerns, and I don't care if their surname is Heard or DeCourcy or anything else, they ought to be putting the article forward themselves, and that ought to be reflected in the warrant, or they should be going before your board in a public meeting and getting your board to put it forward. I don't think the town manager should be letting himself be used this way to put these types of articles forward. But more importantly, I find this article substantively offensive as well, and I know the town council writes a lot about how it is constitutional under the U.S. Constitution, but it doesn't say anything about the state constitution, and the state declaration of rights in that constitution, and I really question whether it would pass muster in that regard. As you know from the recent decision regarding speech to select boards, the state constitution goes well beyond what the federal constitution allows. So I have a lot of problems with that as well. And I also find it really offensive that, for example, that parents or teachers could not silently picket in front of the governor's house a cut in school aid to the town, or they couldn't do the same in front of a member of the school committee's house if they were cutting programs they believed were important. Those are not disruptive of neighbors. You're completely banning that type of activity, and that's completely unacceptable. I have to wonder if you were on the Washington, D.C. city council if you'd be banning protests in front of the White House. Mr. DeCourcy mentioned that the city of Boston has a ordinance on targeted protests in front of residences, and I suggest you take a look at it, because it does not ban them at all. All it does is limit the hours at which they can occur. And I was hoping that the leaf blower article would come up tonight, because I really think it would say a lot about your board and its priorities. If you privilege the noise of leaf blowers, which certainly disturb neighbors, above that of free speech, this article goes way too far. It does not strike the appropriate balance between free speech rights and the rights of neighbors to enjoy their properties. And I think you really need to rethink this and not go forward with the suggested vote that's been presented to you. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 765</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, sir. Any other members of the public wish to speak on this article? Raise your hand and zoom, please. Okay, let's go ahead and wrap up the public portion of this hearing, and we'll now turn to Mr. Hurte, as promised. I forgot what I was going to say. I just think, you know, I think Mr. Diggins had posed a few of his comments to us for reaction. And, you know, I think to some extent we know, and I mean, you could say this about the governor, that, you know, she knew when she was, you know, running for office that there'd be some attention. I think we know that we get some attention, and someone might stop us at stop and shop or certainly come into our meetings. I think to the extent that you'd mentioned that some people have no other way to contact you, I mean, I think there's plenty of ways to contact us these days, you know, by email. Our phone numbers are out there. In these meetings, you know, outside of Warren article hearing season, we have open forum at any meeting that we want, that someone wants to, you know, pose any concerns to us. And, you know, I certainly understand First Amendment concerns. I think Mr. DeCorsi had alluded to a much more minor situation at my house than what has occurred at the governor's house, but, you know, a couple of years back there was a protester, and I won't even go into, you know, what he was saying, but it was one guy, and we weren't home. And our neighbors called and said there's some guy walking out, walking back and forth in front of your house shouting something. So one of my neighbors went out and kind of shooed him along and said, you know, I agree with you, but, you know, this is not the forum for it, and he was gone. But it did shake up my wife and my two young boys, even though it was just one person, it was one person who knew where we lived and was at our house, you know, not so much with ill intentions, but it was enough to kind of scare them and had to go buy a ring camera and whatnot, and the boys would look out the window and say, is anyone out there? And I think that, for me, it was a little bit of a scary situation, and I think it's not necessarily what we signed up for, you know, we serve a, and this is, I just put it in the context of this one board, it's like, you know, we, someone has to serve on this board, and I don't think that just serving on this board means you should have to deal with protesters on a daily basis. But again, and I think there's other ways for people to get in contact with us. I know, you know, a lot of this article is focused particularly on the governor's house, but I think in any instances, and I think the hypothetical that you brought up, Mr. Diggins, I think is telling on how this article is broadly painted, right? I think you had talked about a hypothetical governor that I don't think anyone on this board would have voted for or supported, and I certainly would encourage and support the efforts that were, that you had put forth, but that would also be targeted protests that would be prohibited under this law, as Attorney Cunningham mentioned. So it isn't really meant to target one type of group and one political viewpoint. It's I think, and it's evenly handed, it's written so it, you know, is unbiased to any political position, and for me, I just, I think the safety concerns and the privacy concerns, they outweigh, you know, the First Amendment concerns, and not to minimize the First Amendment, but within the bounds of the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, we're taking action that we're appropriately allowed to do so, and it's certainly something that, you know, for our municipality, makes sense. If we were on the city council in Washington, D.C., I think we would probably have different situations, but this board is not taking a look at this warrant article and applying it in every situation. We're taking a look at this warrant article and seeing if it's appropriate for the town of Arlington, and I think it is, and I think I would be happy to support this.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 289</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Hurd. Mrs. Mahan, you're on mute. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Given this one a lot of thought, when I came in tonight I had a conversation with the chief and I had been listening, as we all do, every morning, but especially guided on this one. I guess for me, what weighs a lot with me is my police chief coming to me, speaking about her being able to do her job, as well as the patrol officers and ranking officers on down also being able to do their job. I understand the free speech element of it, but I'm thinking more of the safety and responding to residents, which I believe didn't include the governor. I think it was the rest of the Arlington residents around the governor who were legitimately fearful to different levels and magnitude, and I put myself in the place of when our police department has to respond to that, and they're really limited in what they can do, and the job is hard enough as it is, and when the chief said, you know, this would give us another two to employ to respond to those calls to fellow Arlington residents. Plus, I certainly would like to see where town meeting weighs in on this, so my free speech doctrine that I came in thinking, gee, I don't think I'm going to vote for this one, it weighs a lot with me when my police chief comes before me, outlines situations, not from the person who was, quote unquote, targeted, or the prime audience, but the residents in that neighborhood. I'll just leave it at that and see what motions are made and go from there. Thank you, Mr. Chair.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mrs. Mahon. I think I'll share a few thoughts of my own. I've also given this one a lot of thought, and I think that I find many of the comments really helpful. Really, hearing the police chief's description of the actual situation and also Mr. DeCoursey's witness really drove home to me that this is not just a matter of noise, it's a matter of disruption, it's a matter of infringing on some of the neighbor's ability to get in and out of their homes, made them feel unsafe. I think Mr. Hurd's comments that this is really specific to Arlington, Arlington's neighborhoods, these houses in all of Arlington are very close to one another, it's a very different situation than Washington, D.C. or other places. I think that weighs heavily on me as well. I think a good case has been made that homes are just different. I don't think we should say lightly that our family members and our friends didn't sign up for this. We did. When I go out in public, and we all go out in public as members of the Select Board, people come here, people can come here and say mean things about me if they want, and that is their constitutional right. They can see me out in public, they can see me at the grocery store, public places. They can see me at, and my Zoom just went down, so Mr. Hurd, could I borrow your computer? All right, I'm now on Mr. Hurd's computer, thank you very much. They can see me out in public, they can stand in front of Town Hall, and I think when it comes to the governor, as Mr. Joukoursy mentioned, protests and demonstrations happen regularly at the State House, on the steps, outside the governor's suite, sometimes loudly. The governor keeps a public schedule, goes to public meetings all over the state, and people can and do show up with protest signs there. There is no lack of access to the governor or any other public official to express your political and exercise your constitutional rights. The only issue is, does that right need to be unlimited, and does it need to infringe on our family members and our children and our neighbors who, as we've heard testimony tonight, have not felt safe? For me, the answer is no, this is not even a particularly difficult one, the only reason I think it warrants a lot of care and a lot of thought is because we are balancing important constitutional rights, important democratic rights, and I think my colleague Mr. Diggins intimated this is a matter of settled law. This is not a question of this being constitutional, but I think there is a moral question that we should weigh, and I have weighed, and that is, should we do it anyway? I think for me, I hope the town meeting agrees that we should, because specific to Arlington, specific to the facts that we've heard tonight, specific to the fact that as elected officials people get in touch with me all the time, I answer a lot of email, I get phone calls, I welcome conversations I have on my walks in my neighborhood, in my community, I'm not hard to find, I think there are lots of ways to do that, I don't feel that we need to give people an unlimited right to bother or scare my neighbors or my spouse because of what I signed up to do. So that's where I'm at tonight, and if anyone would make a favorable motion I would be happy to support that. And I think my Zoom is back, so I'll go back to my computer. Thank you, Mr. Hurd.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Diggins, and unmute, please. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I do have maybe a question or two for the police chief. Sure. Chief Flaherty? And Attorney Munson, you can unmute that machine. Thank you, Chief. So you say they were blocking the street, you know, so isn't that illegal? Yes. Yes. Just a moment. Oh. So we should be done. You know, Mr. Diggins, because of the audiovisual, could you try to group your questions and then maybe give the chief a chance to kind of address them all, if possible? I'll try, Mr. Chair. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I mean, sometimes it's just, you know, I'll try to get better. Yeah, no, do your best. Of course. So was there a remedy, I mean, without this bylaw to the blocking of the streets? Yes, there would be in certain circumstances. Mute yourself. Okay. In certain circumstances, absolutely. These two specific protests, we were working closely with the state police and we were basically waiting for more resources to take any type of action. An arrest would be our very last resort. Our officers are trained in de-escalation skills and that's what they did at both these protests. They did outstanding jobs at de-escalation. I was invited to the state police barracks recently to view the body-worn footage, the camera footage of the state troopers who were wearing body-worn cameras. And it just highlighted how well the Arlington Police Department handled these situations. So yes, there are remedies, but an arrest is the very last resort. We don't want to have to do that. What would the bylaw, what would this allow you to do differently in a case where they're blocking the streets? This would allow us, the bylaw would allow us to shut the protests down immediately. Is there some other way other than this bylaw to get the ability to protect and to keep people from blocking the streets? I'm sorry, the question wasn't clear. So I guess one, is there some other remedy than a bylaw like this to prevent people from blocking streets or creating a sense of fear? I'm still not clear on what you're questioning. That's fine. I'm just not in a position to phrase the question any better. So it's not your fault. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is if there is some other way other than just completely shutting down the protests to allow people to feel safe in their neighborhoods and still allow people to do some level of protesting. For instance, earlier on we were talking about having time limits on the protests, but my sense is that that wouldn't be good enough. I'm just really having problems with shutting down the protests all the time. Also, there are times when we need to allow us as people to push each other to do things differently. I gave a hypothetical. It's not even a matter of safety at that point. It would be a matter of a neighborhood finding something that people don't like. They feel that it's morally bad. You have another group of people who think, no, these are our rights. These are us. We really want to get you to change. They would do a protest. It might even be targeted at the leaders. Yes, it would make the leaders uncomfortable. It would make the neighborhood uncomfortable. But for me, that is part of the democratic process. I just have a hard time saying, and as you all have admitted, that would be prohibited in this. It's that kind of pushing of leaders and even neighbors who may support those kinds of policies. It's a way that we push ourselves. The thought of just shutting it down completely, I came to the state, I'm going to regret the vote that I take either way. It's just a matter of which one will I regret less and which one do I think I can feel better with in the short term and the long term. I just can't get myself to yes just yet. That's where I am. Thank you. Thank you, Chief.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. You can unmute yourself. Before I forget, I want to personally respond. The second hypothetical you raised is a thought-provoking one. I've thought about this since you raised it. If we had a public official like a governor who believed that I should not be married to my husband and had other abhorrent views, I would take to the streets, I would lie down, I would take a bullhorn, I would do whatever I would, but I wouldn't do it at that governor's house because I don't want that kind of civil society. I would go to the statehouse, I would go to public events, I would go to the public library, I would do a die-in like we did for AIDS action back in the day, but I wouldn't do it at their house because I don't want that kind of society. That's why I feel the way I do. I think that's what makes me, I respect anyone who has, I think we're going to have a spirited debate about this at town meeting. I think that's healthy because I like where people are coming from who are worried about this, but for me, it comes down to what kind of town we want to have and what kind of political discourse we have. I have no problem making public officials uncomfortable. That's the job of democracy. For me, the question is where to draw the line. I think we're going to draw the line in different places, but that's how I approach the hypothetical. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Hurd - 523</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hurd. Thank you. Just sort of along those lines and responding to Mr. Diggins, I don't think any of us, nor the chief, thinks that if we pass this bylaw, it's going to stop all the protests. To say we're banning them, then they can't happen, I think there will still be protests. I think it just, in your question, allows them to gather up the protesters and make a situation safe quicker. Again, it's not a criminal, we don't pass criminal laws, so they can't go, I don't think the police department is going to go inside arresting people because they can't, at least not based on this. It just helps them de-escalate a situation. I've seen the amazing de-escalation training that Arlington police goes through, and we've seen it time and time again, not just in these protests where that's exhibited in practice. I think that this, again, it's not going to stop all protests. It just allows the police department to be able to contain the situation. Similar to what Mr. Helmy said, over the past few years we've seen a number of protests. Some may have been targeted towards decisions that we've made. The best place to protest us is on the steps of town hall, I think, and we've seen those. We've seen protests in town hall gardens. In town hall gardens, we've seen protests in Whittemore Park. I think that there's a lot of more visible and more effective places to lend your voice to a specific cause in this town and in other parts of the Commonwealth to do that. I think, again, the house is, we don't have, as was mentioned, we don't have a government mansion, whether it's us, the governor, you've got to sleep somewhere. In very few places have no neighbors. To create a situation where you just allow unlimited protests, it just, I certainly am sympathetic to your concerns, Mr. Diggins, and the concerns of individuals that have spoken against this. It's not something to tread lightly on when it's talking about the First Amendment. I just think that the way it's written, it is something that is appropriate at this time for this town, and who knows? In eight years, a Newtown meeting might say, hey, listen, we had that law, but it's no longer appropriate for Arlington, and they can take a crack at changing the law back to the way it is or repealing the prohibition. For right now, I think this is narrowly tailored, and I think it's appropriate to keep the peace. We're up here to come up with what is the general betterment for the residents of Arlington, and I think that is the situation here. Eventually, we've had these discussions where we've, I think, massaged and gone back and forth with some of the language in these Warren articles, but eventually, we've got to vote on it, and we might be on the same side, we might not be on the same side. At this point, I think I'll move favorable action on the Warren article. Do I have a second on that?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 360</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second. If I could, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, and thank you for your words. First Amendment analysis is challenging, but I think for me, and as Mr. Hellman said, the significant government interest here is the right to residential privacy, and that's what the court case, the Frisbee case, discussed. The other thing that was very important in that case is the inquiry, are there alternatives for the message? That's a key thing. In that case, it was found that there were alternatives, and I think that probably in the comments that we have, depending on how our vote is, those will be mentioned, and so that's part of the balancing that takes place in the First Amendment cases, and we see in the excellent memo from Attorneys Cunningham and Munson, those five questions that need to be asked is, is the bylaw content neutral on its face? Is there a significant government interest? Are there alternatives? Is it specific enough where it's focused on the specific home? That's what brings in the constitutional protection. I do want to say one thing. I had mentioned earlier, before the public comment, I was aware of the Boston bylaw, and the Boston bylaw was between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m., and I was aware of what happened in Brookline, and Brookline, because it went through town meeting, it was subject to review by the Attorney General's office, and the Attorney General's office signed off on it, so questions as to whether that would pass constitutional muster in Massachusetts have been answered in the case of Brookline, which their bylaw is almost identical, very close to what's being proposed here, and I said earlier, the 9 p.m. to 9 a.m., and as Chief Flaherty said, the second protest or the third protest was at 6 30, and once that happened, for me, anyway, a 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. restriction wasn't going to work, and so narrowly tailoring the bylaw meant removing having the prohibition at all hours because of that interest, so I just wanted to get that on the record in terms of what had been reviewed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

I was the individual when they talked about the person who had to be escorted out to get her child. I am the person who the protesters are on my property. So for me, this is really about safety. This isn't about the issue of Nazis or this or that. This is about safety for our community. And again, I just want to thank the chief of police. Her offices have been terrific. And helping us navigate. And I also just want to, I've been here for all three protests. I've been here for all three protests. Some have happened in the morning. Some have happened at six and at nine. It doesn't matter what time they happen. They still put a threat to our safety. The last one that happened at six o'clock. I had a neighbor get onto my lawn. And start shouting at the protesters. And I was terrified. The protesters had flares and they're open incendiary devices in their hands. I was concerned that they were going to throw them at my house at the person who was yelling at them. So I just wanted to make sure that that was heard. Thank you. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to back up the comments made by Mr. DeCourcy. And it's been the effort from the legal department to put the draft warrant language. And we understand that the, there can be divergent views about what the town should do. However, we wanted to put the town in a position where they can be on solid legal footing, that they can do their job. I think that any in the public comment, there was some arguments about Massachusetts, you know, constitution. To me, the analysis doesn't change. This bylaw has written. Is constitutionally permissible. The question of whether the town wants to do is a different one. So just want to say it's that's the position that legal department wanted to put. This board and potentially town meeting. And if they want to consider this. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it's just my final comments. And go ahead and unmute. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So. I looked through our bylaws and they are remarkably quiet, me on protests. You know, I don't just protest. The, the, the, the redevelopment. Bylaws me. And, and it pretty much said that. I guess this one. Paragraph said that. Shouldn't be, shouldn't infringe, should not be interpreted infringe on, on protests me that are within certain kind of vague bounds, you know, but, but they were clear enough, you know, so, I mean, I, as Mr. Heard said, me, we could vote this and, you know, Tommy can put this in and then we could look at it again and, and maybe we will, I, I would like, I would personally like for us to, to not go from zero to a hundred, you know, maybe like do something smaller between, but, you know, maybe Tom meeting will do that. But as for me, me, I remember when I first got elected and the whole banner issue was a big deal. I seriously thought there might be protests in front of my place because of my position on things that people are pretty angry with me about my position, you know, and, and, you know, it never occurred to me to, to even think about me creating a bylaw or whatever me that would, would outlaw protests of that type in this town, you know, and yeah, I could say I signed up for it. I wasn't expecting that, you know, but you know what, once I realized that was a possibility, it's like, well, you know what, that goes along with it, you know, and, and, and yes, me, we're in a dense part of town and I want to even be, well, we're in a dense part of town, you know, and, and, and, and it's a city, you know, and I kind of, you know, I kind of expect at times, me, I'm going to have to tolerate things that I may not want. Barking dogs, me, you know, me, the next door neighbor's barking dogs, me, and I prefer not to hear that, but that comes from being in a pretty dense area. If he's talking about like invasion of privacy, because I have something that I don't like, me, invading my personal space, me, that is, me, but, but it's not a protest, but for me personally, I'd have an easier time with a protest, me, than I would with someone's dog that's barking, me, all times a day. You know, but the, the, yeah, so I guess, I guess, oh, the last thing too is that, me, it's not enough, me, I know we say that people can, can protest here in town hall, you know, but you know what, you see a protest out there, you come in the building here, you come in here, and you're pretty much oblivious to it, you know, at least I am, you know, but, but a protest in front of my place, me, gets my attention, or it would get my attention. You know, it probably wouldn't change my mind, me, because that's the way, me, I'm made up, but, but, me, it's, it's, it's a more effective ploy, me, and I think it's one thing when we are saying that we want to protect ourselves, me, from, from things that make us afraid, me, you know, and, and, and if people are threatening us in some way, we want to protect ourselves from that. I'd like to think we have those protections anyways, but really what I'm concerned about is, is sheltering ourselves, or, or, or making it hard for people to get us to change, me, our, our, our values, you know, when they feel that that's something that should happen, you know, and, and, and so, so for me, me, me, protesting in front of my house is not a matter of, like, say, that's not the kind of society, me, I want, it's like, I kind of want, you know, I want, me, people to push me, me, at times when they think I should be pushed, me, they shouldn't do it in a threatening way, but as I said, I think we have laws that can protect us from that, and, and, and once again, me, let's go a little slowly on this, me, but, but I've said all I have to say, thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Alessi - 1026</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. So my name is John Elessi. I am the senior transportation planner for the Department of Planning and Community Development, and I'm here before you this evening to speak about the Stratton Safe Routes School Project and the proposed warrant article number 53 at town meeting this spring. Next slide. So tonight's requested action from the board is to vote favorable action on warrant article 53, the following draft motion language for town meeting that was shared by Town Councilman Mike Cunningham. I won't reread the entire text language, but the summary of this is just for town meeting to vote to authorize the select board to acquire the land parcels and or rights and land parcels to obtain and secure a public right of way for the Stratton Safe Routes School Project. Next slide. So to give some background on the project, the town received a MassDOT Safe Routes School Infrastructure Grant in 2019 with the project's purpose to provide a fully accessible walking route with safe roadway crossings for children and others to walk to the Stratton School. So I'll note that this is a MassDOT led project. The agency has provided over 1.6 million in construction and design funding for this, and I'll also note that the only town funding required is the right of way acquisition process. Next slide. To give background on the project scope for those who aren't familiar with it, so the area where this project will be implemented is mainly on Hemlock Street and Dixon Ave with some improvements on Mountain Ave and Wheeler Lane. The key project components include new and repaired sidewalks, newer upgraded curb ramps, new curb extensions, and new rectangular rapid flashing beacons, which will help fill the project purpose that I mentioned beforehand. And you can see in the images to the right in dark black, the highlighted project area and below that, an example of the sidewalk that would be implemented for a portion of the project on Dixon Ave. Next slide. So this word articles really revolves around the whole right of way acquisition process and to give background, MassDOT's right of way Bureau requires a town meeting vote to take or otherwise acquire by eminent domain, purchase, donation, or any other means, land and around this project. So Warden Article 53 is requesting that town meeting authorize the select board to vote to approve this right of way process for two reasons. One, the right of way acquisition process needs to take place before the planned construction start date in summer 2025. And based on town meetings schedule, normally only meeting once a year, this could cause delays in the project's construction start. And MassDOT's right of way Bureau permits a town select board to take the vote from town meetings. So those are the two reasons for this Warden Article. Next slide. So the project is currently at 75% design, it's working its way towards 100%. And I say that because as a project advances, there are always changes to the actual layout of the project and therefore the actual right of way process and acquisition can change. But at this stage, I want to give some background on what the acquisition process is going to look like. You can see on the table I have right here, there are going to be 41 affected properties along the project area. And when I say affected properties, I mean the number of properties where there will be fee takings and or permanent or temporary easements. And I just want to note that an affected property might have more than one type of impact. So that's why if you try adding up the numbers to the right, they're not going to add up to 41. The project has three fee takings, meaning that it would be a complete transfer of ownership rights to another entity, that being the town. This means when ownership remains with the landowner, but another entity may use the land permanently. And for this project, I believe this is just a utility permanent easement so that crews are able to access overhead wires. And there would be 42 temporary easements. Again, ownership remains with the landowner, but another entity may use the land temporarily. When I say this, it's meant for construction crews that need to, when constructing the project, step onto someone's property. The town would be paying that landowner for the use of stepping onto the property in order to construct a public right of way project. So, all in all, there are 41 affected properties. The image below is from one of the reference materials provided, outlining each of the properties and the associated landowners. Next slide. So, the next steps for this project, if the select board this evening votes favorable action on this warrant article, I would present to town meeting and request, and then I would go to town meeting and request that they give the select board authorization to approve the right of way process when we get to that point. In the meantime, MassDOT is still finalizing the construction right of way plan since we are at 75% design. The project can change from 75% to 100%, but it's likely not to based on the just general scope of this project. So, it probably will have the same amount of affected properties and types of easements I mentioned beforehand. The town would hire an appraiser to assess the values of the affected properties. And then I would come to the select board at that point to present on the project, the right of way acquisition plan, and request a vote of approval, which again is required by the MassDOT right of way bureau. And then construction would start in summer 2025. Next slide. So, again, the requested action this evening is to vote favorable action and warrant article 53 with the following language that was drafted by town council by Cunningham and deputy town council. So, with that, I'd be happy to answer any questions about the project, the process, or anything else. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. I want to just kick off by clarifying and make sure I understand some particulars here. So, this is a general vote to support a process, but that when we come down to specific takings, those would individually come if town meeting approves this. Any specific decisions about specific properties, easements, permanent or otherwise would still come back to us for individual attention and decisions. Maybe attorney Cunningham could address that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yes, that's correctly stated. This is simply, it's required that town meeting provide this authorizing vote that if you look at the Massachusetts Department of Transportation's right of way bureau requires as a check on the list that you've received that authorization from town meeting. And I just want to thank Mr. Lessey for all his work on this and also Peter Buckley and the legal office has done a tremendous amount of work on this and appreciate his efforts too. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Super question, but I thought I need to. Every. I don't know. In the first place. Like right now, even if there's a sidewalk, we still would have like a public shade tree if it was. We have plenty of streets that don't have sidewalks in my neighborhood and it was always my thought that someone could walk on the first portion of a property. So as they don't have to walk in the street. That may be true. Mr. Project. The state has set forth specific guidelines that we need to follow. So for purposes of this particular warrant article. Required this compensation to which residents are entitled. We need to follow these procedures fairly closely to make sure we're we're moving forward with the project in the way that they want us to. This is a specific requirement that the bureau is asking us to take. They need that authorizing vote from town meeting. But on your larger question, I will endeavor to get you a more complete response. Mr. Thank you, Mr Chairman. I discussed earlier roadway discussion. I had and I may be able to shed a little bit of light. On that. I mean, normal rights of ways for streets. A lot of them are 40 feet wide. And what you see the street itself is 24 feet. And the two sidewalks are 8 feet each. But they could conceivably be some streets that were accepted that the roadway is the entire width of the right of way. So it probably depends on a case by case basis. I think to elucidate that point further, Mr. Chair, thank you. In some of those, the actual fee interest that's listed in the table provided by mass to you'll see instances where it's 16 square feet. So largely the sidewalk is being placed on public land. But for the full length of the parcel, for whatever reason, it has to be kicked over, you know, just a couple of inches. And that accumulates over the course of the property. So by and large, if there is no sidewalk presently present that a lot of times the public right of way does extend into those grassed areas. But it really depends on each and every street layout.</blockquote>

So, I didn't respond to you, Mr. Cunningham, because this one is a little complex, because you didn't have a whole lot to go on, because I didn't pursue my line of questioning with Mr. Schlickman, because I didn't want it to get into an intense back and forth, but when I talked about the demand for it, like they said, like there's 75% rentals, you know, or people who, I guess the statistic was that 75% of people who rent have pets. I wasn't really saying so much that the market has solved the problem. I was really saying that there seems to be a demand, you know, for apartments that would allow, you know, people to have pets. So, I was actually questioning, I mean, why doesn't the market solve this? Because if I had property, and I had a lot of people who had pets, you know, then I might just go, okay, well, this place is open for pets, and kind of raise the price, find out where the market clears, and then, of course, added into that would be some cost that comes along with maintaining the place that has pets. So, I was just kind of wondering, I mean, why isn't the market solving that? And there's a little distinction here, because I don't want to give the impression that I feel that the market has solved this. It may very well be that maybe more people would have pets, even if they could, you know, rent a property that allowed for pets. So, that's really what I was trying to get across in that line of questioning. So, do you get a sense, then, of maybe how to change? Okay, thank you.</blockquote>

Attorney Cunningham kind of jumped ahead at me in that, but I do want to thank the chair and vice chair and anyone who hung out with us as long as they did for this, and I would just say going forward, similar to my job, day job, I always make sure I have two of everything. Actually, I have three. But at least two. So, I hope this isn't something, especially for the select board and or any other board, committee, or commission, that also avails themselves the opportunity for this equipment. So, I would, through you, Mr. Chair, please pass on the message. Please have two of everything. Three would be nice, but please have two. Thank you. Mr. Hurd. For those hockey fans out there, I would like to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For those hockey fans out there, there was a barn burn, a really historic overtime win this weekend, and it was not the PC game against Quinnipiac. It was the annual Police and Fire Hockey game, and the Fire Department had taken the title for the past however many years I can remember, and the Police team fought valiantly, came back, scored a goal to tie up with 50 seconds, and won in overtime. So congratulations to everyone that played. I think it's a fun event for the kids. It's a fun event for the participants. It's certainly something that I used to look forward to when I was younger, and congratulations to the Police Department. They were playing in honor of Danny Kelly this year, so they really wanted to get a win for him, and they did. Thank you, Mr. Hurd. Mr. DeCoursey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is the last meeting, other than opening the next meeting, that you'll serve as chair, and I want to thank you and Mr. Hurd, you for serving as chair and Mr. Hurd as vice chair, and all of us have served as chair previously, so we all know the time commitment and the additional work that is involved, and speaking for myself, you did an outstanding job. I really enjoyed working with you as chair, or having you as chair this past year, and all that you did, your thoughtfulness, the way you conducted the meetings, and as a team, Mr. Hurd, there were a number of times that he had to step in when you had to recuse yourself, and you were a great team, the two of you. I do want to wish both of you the best of luck this Saturday. I don't think it will be necessary. If I'm not duly re-elected by the residents of Arlington, I just want to say it's been an honor and a privilege serving on this board. But I want to thank you both. And I misled Eric, but that's a whole other question. Thank you. Mr. Diggins. I knew you were going to do that, Mr. DeCourcy. So thank you for saying as much to me, but you should have seen those two at candidate's night. It's like, wow, they were really good. They made us all proud. So, yes, Mr. Chair, you did a wonderful job. Thank you very much. Congratulations on another three years. And as much as I like being here on the first night of our year, I like to dress up for that one, I will be in Buffalo. Buffalo. So I'll be Zooming in. So I'll attend the meeting, but I just won't be here. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you to my colleagues and Mr. DeCourcy in particular for your kind words. It has been a rewarding year. It's been a challenging year. But I think tonight's team effort by everybody here in this room is just a really good example of why it is so rewarding and why it is a joy to serve in this role or any role in town. I think everybody, once we figure out how to do this, we actually got it going and everybody was diligent, everybody was patient, everybody worked really hard not just to observe the letter of the Open Meeting Law, but the spirit of it, which is to ensure fair and equal participation. And I think we've had an example tonight of some good, robust debate. We had participants in Zoom disagreeing and we had good discussion amongst the board and we did it in a way that fulfilled the letter and the spirit of that. And that makes me very proud of all of us tonight, but all of us, the work that we do. And so I appreciate that. And we'll see what happens on Saturday. And on note, Attorney Cunningham will get his first opportunity to chair a meeting of the Select Board next Monday. That's right. You might not even know that. Yeah, yeah. It's true. All right. I believe we have finished our business. That's a motion to observe to adjourn. Oh, okay. We have a motion to observe to adjourn by Mr. Dickens and seconded by Mr. Heard about share. No. Yeah. All in favor please say aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Opposed. It is unanimous. We are adjourned. Thank you. ACMI Productions are only made possible with your support.
