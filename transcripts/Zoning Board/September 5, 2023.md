<summary>Patrick Hanlon</summary>

Tonight there's nobody appearing for anybody else because this is a deliberation session rather than a public hearing. And for that reason, we will not be taking any additional information relating to the case. The only matter on our agenda is the 40B application of Housing Corporation of Arlington at 10 Sunnyside. We closed the hearing on this on the 15th of August. And we are beginning the first the first deliberation session. This open meeting of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals is being conducted remotely consistent with the Supplemental Appropriations Act signed into law on March 29th, 2023, which intended extended until March 31st, 2025, the suspension of the requirement to hold all meetings in a publicly accessible physical location. Public bodies may continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location so long as they provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings. Public bodies may meet remotely so long as reasonable public access is afforded so that the public can follow along with the deliberations of the meeting. For this meeting, the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals has convened a video conference via the Zoom application with online and telephone access as listed on the agenda posted on the town's website, identifying how the public may join. This meeting is being recorded and it will be broadcast by ACMI. All supporting materials that have been provided to members of this body are available on this meeting's agenda or the town's website unless otherwise noted. The public is encouraged to follow along using the posted agenda.

<summary>Patrick Hanlon<summary>

There's only one matter on our agenda tonight, as I indicated before, and that is the beginning of the deliberation session on 10 Sunnyside Avenue. So at the outset, I'd like to review with you what I am hoping to do tonight in terms of our procedure. By now, you all have and soon when we share the screen, Christian will put up on the screen a draft with lots and lots of comments and corrections and additions and even some subtractions of the opinion that was prepared by Paul Haverty in August. This will be our basic text and we'll be marking up this text over the course of this evening and probably Tuesday evening next week. I'd like to start at the beginning and then in a very non-Aristotelian way, skip over to the end. So after we do the facts, skip to the waivers, which are a big part of what ultimately we will do, and then go back and go through the conditions. I'm anticipating that this will take at least the two meetings that we have scheduled. I'm hoping it's only those two meetings. I know there are some things that we're going to take a little bit of extra time to work out, but I'd like to get as far tonight as we can. At this point, I'd like to sort of have as a general guideline that we'll aim for about two hours. So that'll take us until 9.35, which is two hours from now. That's sort of a soft stop, so we could go on a little bit after that. But your ability to process all this begins to decline a little bit after a couple of hours, and so it would be probably worthwhile to pace ourselves this time. I'm hoping that it will take no more than two hours to do the whole thing. So at this point, let me pause, and if there are any questions or suggestions, I'd like to hear them. And if not, we might be at the point where Christian should share his screen. My understanding is that all of you have or have access to or have received a copy of the opinion that we'll be working with, so that you can skip around in that even if Christian isn't actually showing it at the time. So that's where we'll go. Again, let me see if there are any questions or anything further that I ought to explain or that you want to explain to me. I would just ask Colleen if she could make me a co-host. All right, then. So Christian, I think this would be a time for... Perfect.

### Statements of Facts

##### Patrick Hanlon

And this will give us a chance to start at the beginning. So I'm not quite sure, there's some interference, and I'm not sure where it's coming from, but if you could check the mutes that you're supposed to have, then that will help. So let's begin at the beginning, and we'll start with the procedural history.

### Commercial Office Footage

##### Patrick Hanlon

The first general issue here is in the very fourth line, and I think that this is resolved, unless someone has information to the contrary. For a long time, we've been assuming that the commercial office portion of this project was 940 square feet, but on further investigation, it's pretty hard to believe why we ever thought that. The plans indicate that it's actually 608 square feet, and Ms. O'Connor changed an earlier draft on August 15th to 600. So you'll see there, the 600 square feet goes in. There's actually lots of other places where that comes up, but unless anyone has a reason to object to 600 square feet, I thought we might begin by doing that and succeeding in solving a lot of other problems at the same time. So I'll give you a chance to look at this.

### District Name, Residential Street Use and Impervious Surface

##### Patrick Hanlon

I mean, the next change is a number four, which I don't think needs any discussion, but if anyone wants to raise a point about it, this is your time. All right, going on. The other thing I will do is I'll go back and change business four, because that's not the proper name for the district. It's automotive something. I just need to look it up and I'll fix that. Right, right. Okay, that sounds good. And the addition of residential uses on Michael Street and Silk Street is probably uncontroversial. On number five, we were attempting to deal there with impervious surface. The testimony that we have was 96%. It was not so clear what the total impervious surface would be, and that has been deleted. And that seems perfectly appropriate, and it's not worth it to try to find out more about finishing the last half of that. But if anyone thinks that that's a mistake, please let me know.

### Affordability

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay, the next item we have on the list is number seven. And this, too, is going to give rise to a concern that will go through what we've raised at some other places as well. As you all know, for most of the time that we've had this, the applicant has been saying that it intends to rent out the units in this building to people who have incomes not exceeding more than 60% of the AMI, and that some of them would be reserved even for people who don't exceed 30% of the AMI. On August 15th, the applicant said, well, we still intend to do that, but we'd like the flexibility to go all the way up to 80% of AMI, which is basically what's allowed under the N40B generally. So, the question here is whether to accept the applicant's request that we replace, or I'm not quite sure about replacing, but that we include the language about going up to 80% of the AMI, or whether we leave that alone. So, there are two options that are set forth here. The option that you don't actually see as an option, because it's what we already have, is what I would suggest we should consider. The applicant may be looking for flexibility, but a statement in the introduction to this document does not give them flexibility, and nor does the condition that we have when this comes up later on give them flexibility. They have the flexibility because we don't have any jurisdiction to set what the maximum amount is anyway. And it seemed to me, when I thought about the request of the applicant, that having gone through all of these hearings, where both for us and for the public, the 60% figure was a really important part of what we thought made this project and what was important about this project, the applicant may yet persuade their funding source to do something up to 80%, and we won't have anything to say about it. But I didn't want to sort of include the 80% figure in our permit, as if we think that it's okay to switch basically from the 60% level that we've all been assuming to the 80%. And it's not that the applicant wants to do the 80%, they just want the flexibility to do it. They still tell us that what they want is to continue with the plan that they've already had. So I would suggest that we not include the up to 80% language here and stick here and later on with Mr. Haverty's language, which ultimately will strongly encourage them to stick at 60%, but while recognizing that we don't have jurisdiction to compel that one way or the other. So that's the issue here, and I leave it up to the rest of you, whether that makes sense to you, or whether you think that we ought to be including the 80% figure.

##### ?

I do have a question for Paul on this. The project eligibility letter says 100% at 60% AMI. Are we allowed to adjust that?

##### Paul Havarty

I wouldn't say that you're necessarily allowed to adjust it, but ultimately the affordability requirements are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the subsidizing agency. I will tell you that I drafted a decision for a board a couple years back where all I did was regurgitate the exact language that was in the project eligibility letter from the subsidizing agency. The developer appealed the decision for a number of different reasons, but one of the things they appealed was the condition that parroted the language from the PEL and the housing appeals committee overturned that language and said you can't impose that as a requirement, even though that's exactly what they proposed, even though the decision expressly ceded that it was the authority of the subsidizing agency. So I mean, I think that we're safe in leaving this as drafted because it simply notes what was proposed. It doesn't attempt to impose any sort of requirement on the affordability, and I think we can leave it at that.

##### Mr. Dupont

Mr. Chairman? Mr. DuPont? So I agree with that too. As long as they haven't actually proposed 80% in their hearings, I think that we're just stating what it is that they've previously said in whatever their filings were. Plus, I think you were referring to B1 that Mr. Havarty had drafted, which sort of explains the jurisdictional issue in all of this and says that even though they're saying 60%, you know, 60% and 100% of the units, that we really don't have any say in that anyway, just as Mr. Havarty had explained when he had essentially parroted the language from the project eligibility letter. So I agree, leave it as is at 60%, and then we deal with the issue again in B1, I believe it is down on, I think, page 10 roughly.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Right. Or do we leave it in the findings as 60 to 80% because they did mention in the hearing that they wanted the flexibility, and then when we go to conditions, we say we want them to stick with the project eligibility letter.

##### Mr. Dupont

Well, my recollection of the hearing is a little different from that. They said they continued to intend to do, I mean, in a way, it's a question is what the intent is. Their plan, and maybe plan is better than proposal here, their plan is to stick with the 60. But, you know, there's lots of uncertainties in life, and they want the flexibility, which they have, in which we're not taking away from them, to go up to 80%. I think condition B1 provides them all of the flexibility that they need. The findings simply denotes what was in their application.

##### Patrick Hanlon

So at this point, I don't want to vote on each one. Is there a consensus to stick with Mr. Haberdy's language here?  Okay. Stay with it. Yep. Okay. All right.

### Town Department Involvement

##### Patrick Hanlon

So the next play, there's, I'm not going to do this generally, but I do want to say that I'm pretty sure that I'm guessing that Samiotis is consultants rather than consultantes. They're South American branch offices, consultantes. Got it. But we mostly are not going to, are going to leave this up to the drafters to try to get these things thing and not waste our time on it. So the next thing is number 10. Most of this, I think, is uncontroversial. It just, I think that we started with the language from an earlier case, and it turns out that in this case, different agencies had consulted. I have two questions. One is it's, I didn't pick out the inspectional services department, but I don't know that they consulted. They're the only ones that I don't have a record and I couldn't say for sure that they wouldn't, but on the other hand, there's lots of things. And I wondered if anyone else was aware of the participation of ISD in any of this.

##### ?

I would point out that Colleen Ralston is an employee of the inspectional service. That's true. That's true. All right.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Well, that's substantial. That's significant input. That's for sure. I wanted to emphasize the conservation commission that comes up a little bit later on. It explicitly declined to comment because this was not in their jurisdiction. As you all know, they, when they say that they must be talking about their jurisdiction under local law, as well as under state law, because our history with them is that when they, but for 40B would have a jurisdiction over a local law thing, they are not the least bit shy about providing us with comments on applications. So they really, this really pretty much takes care of the wetlands issue, at least from the point of view of the, both the state act and the local bylaw and regulations.

##### ?

Mr. Hammond, may I ask you a question?  Yes, please. I'm going slightly backwards, but on number seven, that 25% that it lists first, is that, so it's all affordable, but that 25% is the voucher program housing. Is that what that's indicating?  Mr. Havity, you want to answer that?

##### Paul Haverty

No. So the 25% is the minimum amount required to be affordable in order for it to be an eligible chapter 40B development. Although actually it could be 20% because they're doing it at less than, well, if they wanted it to be 20%, they would have to be having them all at a minimum of 50% area median income. So they couldn't do that if they're going to have some 60%. So it has to be a minimum of 25%. And then we're noting that their proposal is that a hundred percent will be restricted, but we can't require that a hundred percent be restricted as affordable because that's within the exclusive jurisdiction of the subsidizing agency. Is that okay, Mr. Havity? Dan, you're- Sorry. I'm muted.

##### ?

Okay. I understand now. So theoretically, I'm not saying that they would do this, but theoretically this approval could be for 25% affordable housing if the subsidy agency wanted it to be. Well, it would require them to go with a new subsidy program because the subsidy program that they're using is going to require 100% affordable because it's low income housing tax credit. It would literally require a re-imagining of the entire project. So I don't think that's in the cards here.

### Commericial Uses, Mobility Accommodations, Administrative Designations

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay, thank you for clarifying. Welcome. So are there any other proposed changes in number 10? So let's go on to... I don't have anything more to draw to your attention until number 14. So does anyone have something that you'd like to bring up on the jurisdictional findings starting with 11? Okay. Number 14 is a rewrite which says a little more detail about the commercial uses and which includes how far away from them. Are there any questions about that one? Okay, if not, let's go on to number 15. Number 15 is there because in talking about the location, it's helpful to talk about the various ways in which the project is, particularly from a mobility point of view, is ideal for this site. And so it refers to shopping and other things that are quite nearby. Does anyone have any comments on that one? Okay, seeing none, let's go on to number... Whoops. Number 16 should be pretty uncontroversial. It just says that the intersection of Vale Wife Brook and Broadway is 370 feet away. Does anyone have any comment on that?

### Parking

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay, let's go on to number 17. And you can tell from all the red that number 17 is sort of more interesting than some of the others. The... There are two aspects of the... Well, there are three paragraphs there that this all has to do with the parking. The first is one formulation of what the rules are. And the next paragraph after that, which I think is partly wrong, but you'll see, or at least incomplete. The next paragraph provides more about what the parking requirements actually are. And just to summarize them, you're supposed to have one parking space per unit is 43 because you're providing affordable housing for all of those. You get a 10% discount that takes you to 39. That's what the legal requirement is. The board has the ability if certain criteria are met to reduce that down to 25% of 39, which would be 10 basically. And that is sort of basically what is included in the middle paragraph there.

##### Patrick Hanlon

The reason why we go into it, I suggest going into it in some detail is that from the very first day, everybody has been getting this wrong. The applicant's transportation analysis was totally on another planet when it dealt with this. And while Mr. Connor corrected it at our second meeting, it still had been a problem all the way through. And so it seemed to be worthwhile to take a little bit of extra space and to set forth what our role here is, which is we have the discretion whether to provide the parking reductions. The next paragraph addresses really whether 21 is enough. And if you'll remember the applicant produced information that indicated that the rate of parking usage per unit on this one is pretty similar to the average of similarly sized projects that they operate others and put that information in the record. So in doing all of that, this is intended ultimately to set forth the factual basis for the parking requirements and the possibility of a parking reduction later on. So I would suggest that we go with a longer version. It's more complete and avoids a potential for inaccuracy, but I leave it up into you. Thank you.Does anyone have any comments on this one?

##### ?

If we go with the lot where we would take the basically paragraphs, the two paragraphs that are there, correct. The one that begins the applicant and the second one begins the 21 spaces. Yes. Okay. Yeah, so what would go is the first alternative, which is the first paragraph there and then the others will be accepted. And this would all occur as number, I think it's number 18. That's, I don't know. Okay, but it needs an independent number. It needs a number, right. Okay. I agree with the longer version as well. Okay, the next one, the next number, which who knows what that number will turn out to be, but the next real number that starts several neighbors express concern is part of an effort, which you'll see in some further paragraphs of more explicitly taking into account the public testimony and indicating the way in which they're being treated.

### Building Height

##### Patrick Hanlon

So number 17, at least on my copy is, talks about the general height of the building. Is there any,

##### ?

so I have one question on that and maybe Mr. Klein can answer it. Is that at one point during the hearing, I asked what would happen if we did what was being asked and that was to require four stories rather than five. And there was very strong testimony that that would essentially sound the death knell for the project. And I'm wondering if we should find, should at least note that for the record, that was what the response was. And if so, whether this is the place to do that.

##### Christian Klein

No, we certainly could include that. I would ask Paul what he thinks.

##### Paul Haverty

That's fine with me. I wasn't sure if I was on mute or not. Trying to keep up with the changes too. I mean, to me, that was the moment in which fooling around with the height of the building was essentially taken off the table because we wouldn't have been able to accomplish what the neighborhood wanted and still have a project left. I mean, to me, that was the moment in which the neighborhood was taken off the table.

##### ?

Just a quick question about the language. So make the project impractical. Are we commenting on the, what's the term that they use in the decision, uneconomical?  If you have a condition that makes it so that they're not gonna do, make what they need to make. So I guess it's from Mr. Haverty. Do we use the word uneconomical or whatever that term is?

##### Paul Haverty

It's uneconomic. Uneconomic. Would that be used in place of impractical there, do you think?

### Number "18"

##### Patrick Hanlon

Certainly could be. I didn't know if it made sense only because it ties into the statute. It ties into the standard. Of the standard. Okay, we're on number 18. Again, this is addressing some of the testimonies. Mr. Klein, I wonder when we say several tenants, I remember one, but I don't remember the others. There was a letter from a second, I believe. I see, okay. It is possible that it was one who was just very vocal in a lot of different ways. Was just very vocal in a lot of different formats. I could take out the word several. Make that current. I guess I'd say that several just emphasizes that there seems to be more than one. And there can't have been more than two. And Ms. Fontenot raised this quite a bit, but she was raising a lot of things like that. And could we maybe say at the end, at those facilities, because, and the reason I'm thinking about that is that actually it doesn't make sense to get into inter-area quality here. It wasn't a major issue. But it's ironic to raise it because this is passive house construction. And it will, one of the benefits of doing that is to have super high air quality for the tenants. So it is useful to know that they're talking about other facilities that have been constructed in a different way.

##### ?

And Mr. Chairman, along those lines, I just think it would clarify it if we said tenants of other HCA properties, because they're not really referring to this.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Right, they couldn't actually, because it's just, it's not even a hole in the ground. But yeah, it's useful to remind people of that, I think. I'm comfortable with that. Part of the reason is that the applicant had said that they wanted to strike some of the stuff about the management plan that we have in conditions. And I just wanted that this sort of leads to my wanting to maintain that. So I just wanted to include this. Got it, and certainly questions were raised about the adequacy of the management. And to some extent, the applicant did confess that it was a hard problem. So that was a concern.

### Wetlands

##### Patrick Hanlon

All right, should we ready to go back, go on to wetlands?

##### ?

This sort of simplifies the analysis of the wetlands. Basically, this is picking up the point made earlier about the Conservation Commission, that they have jurisdiction not only over the state where they don't have to get an order of conditions, but also the local bylaw and the regulations implementing that. And the Conservation Commission has not asserted jurisdiction with respect to that either. It's also helpful, I think, though, and new 20 and 21, which refer to zoning bylaw provisions that we haven't thought as much about as some others, like parking, for example. And that this is sort of bringing into focus that we have those issues as well, and that we need to make a finding in some way of their meeting both 5.7 and 5.8 of the zoning bylaw. Mr. Klein, do you have anything more to add to that?

##### Christian Klein

I would just say we should probably strike 20 because 20 is already included in 21. Okay. Does anyone else have questions or comments on any of these?

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. Okay. So while Mr. Klein is doing this part, I wondered for Mr. Havarty, in what is, at least for the moment, 22 still, where we say notwithstanding, they still provided to this natural and built environment thing. Is there any purpose being served by that? Why is it that we would care that they did that?

### Stormwater Management

##### Paul Haverty

Much of that had to do with stormwater, and it wasn't really focused on wetlands at all. And I'm just wondering why we're mentioning it. So I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, which one is this? This is, 22 is what it is on this. It says, although located out of the jurisdictional area, the Africans submitted an impact analysis on natural and built environment prepared by Utah and Samoyedes. So all it says is that they filed this piece of paper, and I guess I'm not quite sure why we bothered with that. I don't think it's necessary. I mean, it's sort of just laying the groundwork as to what has been submitted. So it's just sort of pointing out that this is an issue that was at least reviewed.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. So I would suggest, I mean, it just seems to me, after we've done what we've done, this kind of just interrupts the flow. I don't feel strongly about it, but I'd recommend that we take this out. We don't generally put in that this or that paper was filed and it made more sense with a lot of the other things that are no longer in it, in the section. Paul, do you have any objection to that? Is that okay with you?

##### Paul Haverty

That's fine with me.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Was there anything in that analysis that made the head any bearing?

##### Paul Haverty

Not on wetlands. Not on wetlands.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. It had a lot to do with stormwater management. Most of it was devoted to stormwater management and some of it was the general kind of introductory material that every applicant puts in, but it wasn't really oriented to its wetlands. All right. So I think through 23 are simple factual statements. Does anyone have any comment on those? Okay.

### Public Transit

Number 24. Earlier, there was a promise that later on we would talk about the proximity to public transit. And this is the paragraph that does that. It's a little bit broader than the paragraph that we started with because it includes the Clarendon Busway, which also provides two stops. But I think as any of you who spend time down there would realize and do realize that the 87 only runs some of the time and it's literally a four minute walk, not counting the time it takes to wait for the light to change at Elwha Brook to go to the Clarendon Hill Busway. So even though it's in a foreign country called Somerville, it is very much a part of the transportation system. One of the buses there goes to Sullivan Square, somewhere near it. The other goes to Lechmere. All of them are connecting up to subway lines. And so when you put it all together, it greatly increases the transportation accessibility of the project. So that's the reason for being a little broader there. Does anyone have any questions, comments, revisions to that one?

##### ?

Okay, let me move, I carefully, I just read that part. And of course, there's an alternative just below and that's what we used to have. So it's really more or less the same thing, but a little less. Mr. Klein, maybe you would like to address that. address number 25.

##### Christian Klein

Certainly. So one of the things that had come up and was also was brought up in the first. Definitely the first and second hearings. And in a couple of the letters that were sent to the board. With the question about the. The traffic on Sunnyside Avenue has Sunnyside Avenue gets bogged down because there's parking on both sides of the street. It's difficult to maneuver. It's difficult at the end of the street, trying to move on to Broadway because there's parking on both sides, all the way to the end. And so. I basically wanted to make sure to include this. As a finding, because it was something that the. That the neighbors were particularly concerned about, but also later on, there is a condition. And so. I wanted to make sure that we included this in the application. And the applicant to. Basically. Petition the transportation advisory committee to consider. Putting. Temporary loading zone in front of the building. And also having a new parking. Within 20 feet of the corner so that. Cars can move out of the center out of the travel lane when they're making their terms.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. All right. Going once, twice. I think we've accepted this one. Okay. That takes us to civil engineering. So. Okay. This one. I mean, through 28 is, does anyone have any comments on 28?

### Infiltration System

##### ?

I forget who purple is. I think that's part that's Paul, but. Yeah. Because we don't have impervious. Because we. We've asked for a waiver of the infiltration system. And now they're not. And they've asked for a waiver of the. Provisions of the local bylaw that in turn would record. We impose the requirement to abide by the statewide manual, which is what this is all about. And so. Abandoning the infiltration has largely pulled the reason. Out from. The bylaw itself. The stormwater bylaw is inapplicable unless you increase the impervious surface by a certain amount. Or have. Disturbance of more than an acre. But here. The whole property is less than an acre. And the impervious surface will actually be less. So. The bylaw probably on its own terms, doesn't apply. And when we get to the waiver, we'll. We'll address that. But this is ultimately related to that conclusion.

##### Patrick Hanlon

If there's no comment. I think we can probably say we're okay with that one. Now with respect to. The. I did review the handbook. Yes. And sort of what they're proposing is within the guidelines of the handbook for an existing parcel. So it's, you know, we're not going to say that it's best management practices or anything like that. Okay. Does that seem right to you?

##### ?

Yep. That seems fine.

### Solar Array Shading

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. All right. So we're now does solar access and shading impacts. And again, Mr. Mr. Klein, you may want to address that one.

##### Christian Klein

Yeah. I just wanted to make sure that we included that finding here. Just to, because we had specifically requested that information. Does anyone have any questions? Okay. Let's accept it. Yes. Whoops. That must be Elaine. Yes. Indeed. There you go. Okay. If I'm remembering correctly, there is an existing system on the parcel that could. That is the. That has the most potential to be impacted. Does that make sense?

##### Patrick Hanlon

Like if that's different that. I don't think that's actually the case here. Right. Right. So I think it's something, something about the most impacted site. I don't know. What the right phrasing is. Impacted. Impacted. So is it. Ms. Hoffman is the point here that.

##### Ms. Hoffman and Various

Is. Is the point here that the. That the site that is the potentially the most affected. Is the site that has the most potential to be impacted. Does that have a higher potential amount? Whether they have it or not. Or is it that. I mean, because. What happens was supposed to turned out that. The most, the existing site. That. An existing site has. It has a photo of a cultic system. And, but the one next door has a higher potential, And so. I don't know if that's what people want it. Which are we concerned about? I mean, why, why, why, I guess my, the deeper question is, why is you should we care whether they have already got a photo electric system or not? Because I'm not, I'm not a hundred percent sure that this. That this one does, but I, I maybe. I don't remember completely. I don't care whether they have one or not. I just wanted the language to be accurate to what was assessed. So. So what I think. I thought it was. I thought it was the language to reflect that rather than saying, this is the worst case scenario. That could have a worse impact. So there, there was no other building, no other home in the area that could have a worse impact. Correct. Right. So, and I, so I thought the language to reflect that rather than saying. System. So I think, Okay. Or the. Most impacted. Okay. Like that. Okay. I think that's fine.


##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. Good. Done. Thank you. So we can accept all that. Okay. And here. There are. Let me just see. The. Okay. So. This is what we had in. What we talked about earlier. And I would think that we'd want to resolve it in the same way. We've added here. The project eligibility letter. Which we discussed in that we didn't add in the other place. I think I'm happy to going either way on this, but I wonder. Mr. Mr. Danger and referring to the project eligibility. When we talked about it before we. Eventually also told us about another place where you just copied the project eligibility letter and got your head handed to you by hack. And I was. But again, so this is a finding. It's not a condition. Right. So we're not imposing any sort of requirements. So. It's not. It's not a major involved there. Great. So in light of that, I'm perfectly happy with it. Does anyone. Does anyone. Have a problem. Okay. So let's, let's accept that one. And. Okay.

### Affordability, Sustainability, Word Salad

##### Patrick Hanlon

Number 32. So Mr. Klein, why don't you address that one?

##### Christian Klein

Sure. So 32 again. I think it's important to note that there were a number of applications. And many of them were very much in favor of the application. And specifically, we're very glad about the deeper level of affordability. That was being offered. And so I just wanted to capture that in the findings. Does anyone have any comment on that?

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. Without objection. Why don't we take that as accepted? Okay. So while that process is going on, I have a question. That I went that I just thought of as we've been working our way through. This. One of the major. One of the things about this that sort of is lurking in the background about the project. Is that it really does go quite far. It's going to have massive house construction. It's going to have solar on the roof. If I. If I remember correctly. It is not quite all electric, but. It's mostly electric with one exception that they're going to be essentially pre wiring to turn to electric when it's possible. And I was wondering whether. The thought did occur to me that especially with the. The. The. The scenario way by objectors, whether it would make sense. Someplace earlier on in the discussion of pro of projects to have a finding of fact. Relating to sustainability. That's along the lines that. That I just said. That is actually something that is in the. Impact report that, that we just took out, but.

##### ?

It would make sense. It would make sense. We can come back with language. It would be a simple paragraph. To. To insert. Is anyone but me attracted by doing that?

##### ?

Mr. Allen. Yes. Mr. I agree. I think. I think that's a great idea. To do that. I did have a question though. I don't know if it was in the impact report. But they, I think they said that they were. Exploring passive house. I couldn't remember if they committed to that or not. So. Just asking the question, whether that was decided, or if that was an option. On that one. It was decided. Although it isn't. I mean, we're not being, I mean, I don't know if it's an option on that one. We do require something with the all electric part, but not the passive house part. But I mean, the other thing is, is that. I mean, You should realize that although they were very helpful. To the town in offering testimony necessary to adopt the specialized stretch code. That will apply to them anyway, and they won't have a choice about passive house.

##### ?

Yeah. That's a good point. I think. I I'm not. I think it should be clear in a language that it's. It's. Aligned with what will be required. Yeah. Maybe I'm speaking out of turn, but I, I think. I think that their attorney at one point. Had argued that, That it was a state process. And that this was a state process. They didn't know if they needed to comply with the new specialized stretch code. That was. Well, that did come up in the other process. I don't remember Ms. O'Connor ever. Okay. Ever saying that. And I will say that that HCA did testify. Before the select board in favor of the specialized stretch code there. They're not seeking. They're not seeking. They're not seeking. They've also testified. In favor of the stretch code. So they've, they've been strongly supportive. They're not just an ordinary. Apartment builder who will have to follow the law. I'll get, I'll get some language to you for the next time. And, and, and, and we'll see. It'll be pretty. Pretty plain vanilla, but it will just sort of announce it. Okay. So the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the state's position as is the state's position is that the specialized stretch code is a state. State legislation and is binding. But not everyone agrees with that.

### Waivers

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. So we have now finished. The findings of fact and are ready. To go to the decision. Waivers. And so we're headed back. Okay. So. The first two. I think are unexceptional. But does anyone have anything to, any comments to make on either of those?

##### ?

Pat, I would just note on number two, the applicant had said it was 20 feet. It is 24 feet because it's. And so it ends up being 14 feet plus 10 feet. So it's 24 feet.

### Open Space

##### Patrick Hanlon

Yeah. I would, this came up on August 15th. I thought, and I. I think, and I thought that the applicant actually agreed with that at the time. Okay. Number three. The. The issue with number three was filling in the blanks. And I was wondering, I was wondering if there was a way to fill in the blanks for the usable open space. Because they don't have anything that meets the distribution. The 25 by 25. Objective. I was wondering what we still have a blank on landscape. And I wondering whether we should just. I don't know if we're able to fill in the blanks. As a show as shown on the approved plan. So that at least that nailed it down to what. To what it looks like on paper. But I don't know if we're able to fill in the blanks on the landscape open space. Mr. Klein, do you have an idea about what to do about that?

##### Christian Klein

I would, I can take another look at their landscape plan. And try to make it. Termination based on that as to what the percentage ought to be. And then I would have to look at their second floor. Two sides. And so that would count towards landscape area. And then I just need to check. The bylaw as to whether or not their second floor area would qualify or not.

##### ?

Right. So I think if we can sort of tell ourselves that we accept. The part that's in red and let Mr. Klein. Do a little more work on filling in the blanks on. The second floor. This could be put into the bag.

##### ?

Mr. I was just looking at the cover sheet for the drawings that they submitted with the initial application. And then that table of the zoning summary. There's there's some information there about. They're open space. So I'm assuming that's calculations from them because it's listed under the proposed column.

##### ?

Okay. So. Landscape and 2000 square feet usable open space. There's a good time. The 2000 usable. 2000 usable and 1500 landscape. Okay. We can work with that. Okay. I'm slightly, unless this. Is it, how is it. Just out of question, how is it possible to have 2000? Square feet of usable open space. It may be counting the. The open deck above. I don't know. It could be 2000 square feet. It seems like a lot, but anyway. I think I. I mean, I appreciate your raising that and that's something we should take a look, take a look at as, as is always the case with applicants. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't need to be taken with a grain of salt, but it is. It may turn out to be that. That's. It's certainly a good place to look.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. So we're going to leave this in this sort of. Semi resolved situation. And see if we can't work on. Okay. It is possible in my view that we won't be able to fill the blanks in a way that we're. Comfortable. I mean, In being able to find. And so we may have to think about how else to deal with them. Okay. So. We are now getting to. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. I guess that was just background. All right. So in the next, the next is. Is it me? All right. I'll talk less. Lovely.

### Bicycle Parking

##### Patrick Hanlon

On the next item is. The parking. The parking. And so give you. Why don't I just give you a moment to. Read this and then I'll sort of set the stage and then maybe ask Mr. Klein to explain. The option that he prefers. And I've got. Somewhat different view, but. Okay. Thank you.

##### Christian Klein

Okay. So really the difference in substance between these two formulations. It has to do with the ultimate conclusion. The. The. Obviously it sought 70 spaces, which by the applicants calculation was what the bylaw required. Of which. The largest part. You have to tabulate them separately. Between long-term and short-term. And. They have asked in on August 15th. That they would like to have much less than that. So they're planning on 60 spaces instead of. 66, I think. And five spaces instead of six for a short term. But. They don't want to be committed to that. They want to be committed to something less. So. The very day they filed the application at a time when they were talking about having 70 by spaces. They were asking for a waiver. Down to 43. So they've always had. This big gap between what they say they're planning to do and what it is that they are willing to be held responsible for doing. So they're asking for a waiver. Down to 41. That's what they're asking. But it's possible that they've asked. They're asking to reduce that 43 to only 21. So we have really three main options. One is we could say. All right, you can have it down to 21. Which is a pretty big gap between 21 and. And 60, something 66. And that's what they've asked for. And we could say, well, We're always at 43. That is what. At least in terms of their written waiver, that's what they've asked for. And we could say with that, we'll keep you at 43. This is what you started with. You haven't shown us any reason why it is. It needs to be more flexible than that. And that's still a long way. From the, from what it is you're saying you're planning on doing anyway.

##### ?

Okay. Other than deny the waiver. Is to say, look, you say that you are. You're going to do. X, Y, and Z. You say, you're going to put all of this in here. And you. And we're going to hold you to your word. So we're going to wave it only to only insofar as it's necessary. To get down to what you are stating. That you're that you're willing to do. Okay. So. There are two of these. Alternatives. Except the 20 going down to 21. The one above gives you two sub alternatives. One of which sticks at 53 and the other would go to what it is they're planning to do. And the one below the second one. And the one above it. The one below that, the one above it is what you would normally request it as a waiver to just enough of a waiver to let them do what they say they propose to do. And with that we'll call him. Mr. Klein, who's got a view on this. And this is, this is one of those issues that we need to discuss. Just say that there, there has been a certain amount. In a project that is asking for drastic parking reductions. From us that we're entitled to give. You know, it makes a big difference. At least to me, whether you're talking about at least being pretty near code for the. For the bicycle parking in a place that's being vaunted as a great location for bicycles. And, and then a much more modest. Commitment. So the, the only other thing I want to say is that last pair. Set last sentence. And the first option. Needs to be there period. Because one of the things that they've asked for is a variation. Of the parking design guidelines. From the bicycle parking design guidelines. This is what enables them to hang the bikes up and with, without that waiver. Then the conversation about numbers is entirely idle. Mr. Klein. Mr. Klein, you're muted. There we go.

##### ?

Okay. I've been trying to find it. Where she sort of provided some. Minor corrections to the draft. Decision. And I had thought in there was where she had indicated the two numbers were 60 and five. Which is why I had included them in mine. And she had. Factual finding number 26. In the draft. She was looking at. She said change 70 to at least 60 long-term and 10. Two five short-term. Yeah. And I've lost my place. There's a concern that there may be a need for more space. When the final plans are done. In these areas. And it was ultimately the reason for the reduction that she asked for was to accommodate. The concern that they may need some more space when the plans are done. So they reduced it from there. Then with respect to the waiver. It's a little hard because. We have it listed as two different waivers and they have the. I don't know if that's what she said. But what she said in number two is number four, which is this waiver possibly. Revise 1.5 and insert one. Which I think would be incorrect. And the total parking spaces required are 43 and the applicant seeks away for, for 21. Now that. That's totally about automotive. It could be, it doesn't say. I don't know. In their waiver request about bicycle parking, they'd never mentioned the word bicycle except in the very last line. I don't. I did actually check that. And I don't believe that that's the case. In their request. I believe they did. In the material they sent to us. Okay. So. So. In their revised list of waivers. Yeah. The heading is bylaw section six, subsection 6.1 0.12 and the bicycle parking design guidelines. So we're already in the bicycle world. Then the, she recites the. So. The applicant proposes 43 spaces. The applicant seeks a waiver from the bicycle parking design guidelines. So I guess the. The thing that. Comes in. She's always been talking about the design guidelines. And. I suppose that that bleeds over to the numbers. As well, but it's clear that this is a section that. She's. She's. Yeah, I read that differently. I read it as. That she's. Misunderstanding what. What number four was requesting. So. I will say that in the very beginning, they had the same language. This is not changed in the, in the. Revision. And again, it's 43 and it's not 43 broken down into pieces, the way you'd expect it to be. So it's, it's just a puzzlement.

##### ?

And of course. This O'Connor isn't here to. To clarify. What it is. She. She intended there. To be. If there's sentiment to be. I don't necessarily believe that it's proper to interpret her request. For going down to 21. But I can't. Exclude that either.

##### ?

Okay. Mr. Mr. I agree with you. I think. I think I would, I would not feel comfortable doing that, but I do think that. The. The. The guidelines. The applicant, a lot of flexibility as well, in terms of how they can arrange and. You know, Create the bike parking that we're. Giving them a waiver for as listed here. Because those, those hanging. Bike parking spaces are really much more efficient than the ones that are required. Right. So. You know, There's several drawings that show what their bicycle parking. Plans are and where it's all supposed to be and so forth. It's quite clear that you wouldn't be able to achieve even if they're 43, I think, but certainly what they're proposing to do without being able to rely on the waiver of the design guidelines. Okay. So. Whatever I just read that they actually were asking for in the memorandum. Where do you all stand?

##### ?

Mr. I'm a little torn on it. Cause I've seen this go. The other way where. We had a. Affordable projects. That was recently built and, you know, we're walking by the site. And, you know, most of the bike. Storage spaces were. Empty. I'm trying to find a balance as to what that number should be. I know. Cause I also agree that, you know, we're reducing the parking pretty significantly. And also we've really touted the. Being right next to the. The bike path. So. Trying to find that balance. But definitely, I think somewhere in that 60 or 40 is probably. I don't know. I will say it. I mean, it's theoretically. We can grant a waiver for what if we want, I think. Mr. Heavily can tell. I mean, if we decided.

##### ?

Well, 60 was not giving them quite enough flexibility in 43 isn't supported in any way. It doesn't broken down between long and short-term parking. But it's. It's just. It's just. This capability of filling in an infinite line. And so we could do that. That. It is possible for us to do that. Any particular place on that continuum that you fall is arbitrary. But I suppose if it's just related to the request and it's just a, there provide additional flexibility with that.

##### ?

Yeah. No, I'm still, I still sort of feel that the. That that brief request that was put in. To put the number one to change 1.5 to one and change it to 40. You know, change the number. To 21. Really applies. I think it was. The, the, the car parking. I just think it was an error on their part. Because earlier on they had said they wanted the numbers to be 60 and five. So I think it was just, it's just odd if the waiver request is different than what they asked for in the finding. It was however, in the beginning as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to make sure whichever we do, we're very deliberate about. What the numbers should be, what they're requesting and what we're giving them. Right. This point, I think we're very clear on. What the number ought to be. And. I think we are clear on what they're. It was just sort of just saying of the three things that to be clear on one is what. Is what would be required without a waiver. And I think we have that pretty clear. One is what they're actually proposing to do after taking the flexibility that they feel that they need. And that is the. What I read from there. Is that. What they're proposing to do. Is what they're requesting. Which is different from what they're proposing to do. Requesting is what they're willing to be held accountable to. And proposing is what. They aspire to. And we have to. And I don't know that. Other than saying, I think that. The three things that they're proposing to do. Are not. Represented a big difference between what they're responsible for and what they want to do. But. But on the other hand, they, they do say. That the reduction that they've requested in the findings of fact. Are there specifically to provide them the flexibility they need to deal with. I don't know. I'm a little bit worried that. I'm a little bit worried about overdoing it. But. But again, I have in the back of my head. That we are. Planning on allowing them. A pretty big reduction in parking. Although we have some justification from that apart from this. Well, I think if we go in. We can. You know, we can. Assess it at 43. And then. In our decision, in our. Your response to the waiver request. We just need to be clear as to what we're asking for. Okay. Mr. Mr.

##### Adam

Thank you. a slide in one of their presentations devoted to the bicycle parking. And in that they show 64 long-term spaces with eight short-term spaces. So I think leaving it with the 60, and I believe it was five for the short-term, I think fits within what they've presented to us. I think you're right, Mr. LeBlanc. They originally were presenting the additional numbers, and then they're now reducing them, but they're not reducing them anywhere near as drastically in terms of what they're proposing to do, as opposed to what they wish to be held accountable for doing. Yeah, and as you mentioned before, the requirement to waive the design guidelines for the bicycle parking gets them to that number, based on the slide that, you know, they're saying certain ways of storing bikes gets them this many spaces and the like. So you're right, we would also need that waiver request for the parking guidelines. Mr. Riccardelli, do you have a view?

##### Mr. Riccardelli

I agree with what Adam just said. I think, you know, we can only work off what they've asked us for and the plans that we've been shown, and so far they've been proposing more bikes than this, and if they're asking for a reduction, you know, I personally feel more comfortable with the 60 and five number, because it has some finding in what they've asked for, and it's still a reduction from what they originally showed us, rather than what I'm sort of interpreting, is that if we go with the 43, we're sort of guessing at how that's distributed amongst the long-term, short-term. Yeah, I think that I don't know of anything that is clear about that. So the people I can't see on my screen are, Ms. Hoffman, do you have a view?  There you are. Hi, sorry. I think I agree with what you and Dan have been saying, and I would like to hold with the 60 and five.

##### Mr. Hawley

Mr. Hawley. Yeah, I think if I understand it correctly, so they're seeking 43 instead of 60, right? That flexibility they might use to swap out any discrepancy or, you know, special arrangement that they have for other parking space looks like. I think that's, I think it's clear that they have in mind asking for 43, because they've done that from the beginning.

##### ?

Yeah, could we know a little more according to the question or too late for that? It is ironic that on the 15th, this is one waiver that we didn't talk about at all. Right. It would have been nice if we didn't think of it. Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Hawley.

##### ?

No, I am right. I think they're seeking 43 from what I could, from what I gather. I could, either way, I mean, 43 is not bad, 21 is out of question for sure. So, if it's 60, 60 or five long term, short term or 43, either way, it's okay for me. I don't see a significant impact. Right. So, I don't see a significant impact, but I think they're seeking 43 from what I gather. So, Mr. Klein, you're an expert in counting votes, and these votes have all been very thoughtful votes and not just yes or no or 43 or 60. So, where do you think we are?

##### ?

So, I believe that we are, look, so the, I think, so there's two parts. One is what the request actually is. And I think we are, we have sort of gotten to the point where we're all in agreement that the request is for 43 bicycle parking spaces, but they do not make a differentiation between short and long. So, working off of your language, I was just changing sort of the back end of it. So, it would read, the total number of bicycle parking spaces required by this section would be 72 spaces, 66 spaces long term and six short term. The applicant proposes 43 total bicycle parking spaces. The applicant also requests a waiver from the bicycle parking design guidelines. And I would leave it at that. They didn't ask for any additional waivers from other aspects of the zoning bylaws that relates to bicycle parking?

##### ?

Well, I think that one of the, the reason I put that language in there actually is because I think the bicycle parking design guidelines are just guidelines and they're not actually a waiver of anything.

##### ?

Okay. And the only reason why they matter is because they expound upon certain provisions of the zoning bylaw that deal with design. So, essentially, they're like interpretative rules. And if you don't, if you only waive the interpretation and don't waive the underlying statute, you haven't really accomplished anything.

##### ?

Okay. So, if we were to maintain that, I think we need to be very clear about what provisions of the, we're waiving because it's a big section. That makes sense. Yeah, I agree. So, if we're okay with this portion of it, then this being the or part of strike all of that, then the board, then we do need to come up with a better statement as to what exactly we're doing. And I think waiver granted doesn't quite do it.

##### ?

Yep. The question, I think we have sort of a couple different options here. So, one would be we can provide them with the numbers that we want. And if we should do that, we should also provide some guidance as to what parts of the, whether it's 6.110 or 6.112 or whatever that section is, 6.112, that we are willing to waive.

##### ?

Great. All right. So, what I would propose doing at this point is leaving it at that. We'll go, we'll finish off, we'll go back into 6.1.12 and specify that that isn't very difficult. And so, we'll have language, I guess, that I do think that if we give them a, if we did give them a waiver of 43, I think that if they haven't asked how it's distributed, we need to, because it makes a difference whether it's long and short term. And I don't know how you would interpret 43 when the statute breaks it down that way. And then let's leap on it and, you know, come to a conclusion, and come to a conclusion next Tuesday. Okay. Okay. This is actually probably the hardest thing so far.

##### Mr. Dupont

Mr. Dupont. I didn't ask you what you thought, because you weren't on my screen. Oh, you know why? Because I was just sort of ticking along with Adam and Dan and then Venkat. I just tended to think that, you know, what they said or what they had on their plan, which was, I believe, what was it, 66 and five or whatever those numbers were. I mean, that's really all we know, except for the fact that they're saying 43, but it's undifferentiated. And your comment earlier was we could put in any number we wanted. And what I was curious about, though, is just in terms of formatting, if we say, you know, that they're requesting 43, and then we have to somehow expand on that by saying, well, that's going to be divided into X number of long term and Y number of short term, are we actually granting the waiver? Or are we denying the waiver and imposing some other condition? I'm just not clear what our actual, you know, what the format is, if we say no to what you've asked, because you haven't given us enough information, and we're supplying you with information. I just didn't know if that provides some additional problem for us, from a draft perspective. That is an interesting thing. It's a little bit different from saying granted to the extent that, right, because you're dealing with apples and oranges here, because they're asking for a single total, a combined total, when we're thinking about having it separated out. You know, you could probably give them less than they ask for, as long as it's on the same scale. I'm not sure what happens when you take an additional step there. Mr. Havity, I've now filibustered long enough for you to have some thoughts on this. I wonder if you could comment on Mr. DuPont's observation.

##### ?

With regards to the issuance of a waiver, your authority is really anywhere from what the bylaw requires, all the way down to zero, and it doesn't have to be specifically what the applicant requested. You can grant even more leeway if you want. You can grant less. At the end of the day, the only really deciding question is whether or not they can construct their development as proposed, if you don't grant this waiver. So, if they don't have enough space to do the number of bicycle parking spaces that you are proposing to require, that's going to lead to an appeal and a claim that your decision has rendered the project uneconomic. So, that's really your only limiting factor. If you feel that there's sufficient amount of room for them to do the number of bicycle parking spaces that you are requiring, with whatever leeway on the bylaws in terms of the design standards that you grant, you can pretty much do whatever you want. Thank you.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Welcome. All right. So, I still think thinking about it and getting it combined, you know, Mr. Klein has already sort of put things together about that, and the key thing, I think we're okay, really, with the language of four describing what the problem is, and now we have to just describe what we can do for the short-term phase, space. And I'm not 100%. Some of us, I think, really would like to go towards the 60, and some of us would like to go towards the 60, and some of us feel fancy about that and might want to stick to the 43 in order to avoid inadvertently making the project uneconomic if things break wrong, and some of us feel both ways at the same time. So, I suggest, why don't we work out a couple of alternatives for the waiver-granted language and just go up or down on something next week.

### Parking Waiver

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. So, if that's acceptable to you, that can be a reserve point, and we get to number five, and number five is the parking waiver, and the options that are here are twofold. One is to say it's denied as unnecessary because we're exercising our authority to reduce the number of spaces, and to do that, we have to say that there's a sufficient number of spaces, and we also have to say there's a TDM plan. We have required a TDM plan, or we will have required a TDM plan, maybe even in more than one location, but the TDM plan is sort of a special purpose thing because many of the things that are listed in the bylaw as things that we should be considering are things that the applicant can't do, and some of the things that they are willing to do are not listed. So, there's a catch-all there, and there's a good argument that we are capable, we have the authority to, but we don't have a TDM plan. We're only asking, making them make one up and get it approved by the senior transportation manager. So, I would say that it's not like 100% sure that the reduction here is strictly in compliance with the statute. So, one way of doing it is to say, do the same thing as we'll be asked to do with respect to the stormwater bylaw, and to say that it's unnecessary and we're exercising our authority to reduce the number of parking spaces to 21, and that's a possibility. The second possibility is to say that the board believes it would be sufficient, and the TDM plan is also sufficient, and we exercise our discretion to allow the reduction, and to the extent to which it might be thought ineffective, the waiver is granted. So, the first one basically just is exercising our authority, and that's it. The second one is exercising our authority, but granting the waiver just in case. And Mr. Klein, I wonder if you have a view on any of this. Mr. Klein, your microphone's off. Thank you.

##### Christian Klein

We are allowed to reduce the amount with a TDM in place, but we don't have a TDM, and they haven't really talked about one per se. So, I think sort of the alternative that you provide, just the one in red, makes a little bit more sense, because we are allowed to make the reduction. We don't have a TDM, but we find in this case we can just grant the waiver. Does anyone else have a view?

##### ?

I agree with that. If it's a prerequisite for the waiver denied to actually have a TDM plan, and we don't have it, it seems to me that the alternative at least deals with that fact, if I understand Christian's comment. So, if I do, I favor that approach, the alternative.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Does anyone else wish to address this one? Okay. So, I think right now, so far, the alternative has it. So, if anyone dissents with that, please let me know, and we'll continue talking about it. Otherwise, we can put this one to bed. Yeah. Our ability to reduce the parking through TDM requires them to adopt at least three components, and most of them, they're not allowed to provide by their funding mechanism. So, I think we may be in a position where we really only can grant the waiver. Right. Okay. Well, I think that seems sound, and why don't we say that that's where we are, and go on to the next. They get easier after this.

### Parking Space

##### Patrick Hanlon

The next one has to do with the parking spaces. The only question I have there, the numbers are a little bit dodgy, I think, on this one, but I have a feeling that the insert on the third line down, 60% or 21 spaces, is probably meant to say 60% of 21 spaces, which isn't perfect, but it's a lot closer to the 11th that they're asking for than whatever 60% of X that comes out to 21. I didn't write that part, actually. Is that, Mr. Havarty, was that your intent? Which one is this? This is in number six, the third line down, the applicant requests a waiver to allow 60% or 21 spaces, and so on, and I think that in their actual request, they specify that what they're asking for is 11. Am I right about that?

##### Paul Haverty

I'd have to go back and look at that, Mr. Chairman. No, it doesn't say. It says to permit more than 20% of the spaces to be sized by compact car, but I'm pretty sure that at some point, they say they want 11 spaces to be compact spaces.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Does anyone remember that differently? Unfortunately, I can't find that statement from Mary where she's saying that. I can't find that statement from Mary where she's saying that. She sort of outlines what she's looking for, for final changes. Let me see if I can, I can find it. I have it sort of sitting out. Let's see if I can, that probably is where my 11 came up. All right, so this is waiver number six. Yeah. And what she says there is the applicant seeks 11 compact spaces or 60%. Okay. So I think it would be the easiest thing to do and the clearest thing to do is just grant her 11. And then not worry about what it's 60% of. Yeah. Not to complicate anything, but it's 21 spaces total, right?  So 60% would be like 13. Right. Okay. Yeah, I'm aware of that. When I said that the arithmetic was, the numbers were a little dodgy. Yeah, I'm just saying, okay. And I did actually some manipulation and could not find any number that was related to 60% that would have any meaning in this case at all. So it's just rounding error. Okay. But the proposal in any event is whatever they're asking for is to grant it. Yeah. And I think that we probably are willing to do that. Is there anybody who would object to that? No. Okay.

### Aisle Size

##### Patrick Hanlon and Others

So the next waiver is number seven. And this is the, to reduce the aisle size. And I'm not sure, I don't think that there, that is, there hasn't been any discussion of that. Does anybody have any objection to that one? Did her most recent request further reduce that to 21? That would refer to the memo, right? Yeah. Number seven. Yes, they does. It does. They do have 21. 22 should be 21. Okay. Let's say at 21 feet. I'm getting a little concerned. That's just how much maneuvering space they really have. Now I would ask other members of the board what they think about the number of 21. I agree with you, Mr. Clyde, 22 is fairly standard. I mean, it's always required to be 24 in most jurisdictions, but 22, you see around 21 does feel kind of tight for 90 degree parking spaces. But it's on the, what do they have in their plans? If you were looking back at the drawings. It was originally 23, I thought. And I had written down here 22 and until the memo, that's where I thought they were on the, until Ms. O'Connor's memo of the 15th. I'll check through the drawings right now and just see what they add. You know, our decision here does have some bearing on the bike parking as well, because the more constricted this is, the harder it is for them to balance everything, which I think is part of the reason why you're seeing a certain degree of angst on their part. They've got only a little bit of space and they've got to meet a lot of goals for that space.

##### ?

Mr. Chair, it looks like based on the drawings that I'm seeing, they're saying 23 feet. I do recall, I think it was at the last meeting where they did request for that to be reduced. I don't know. I don't recall. Does anyone remember what? It sounded more, what it sounded a lot like was that they were redesigning that lower floor and were just looking for, you know, sort of some blanket room to move and maneuver things. And they didn't have a specific request in terms of, you know, there's this situation we ran into, we really need to have 21 feet.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Right. Well, as you all know, I don't have the expertise one way or the other on knowing what is or isn't an appropriate thing here. But I am somewhat concerned that as you get smaller, as you get smaller and smaller, you develop a safety problem that we wouldn't want to do. So it's, if I'm right about that, then it's not sort of cost free to keep going down. I don't have any problem with 22 and I don't have the sense that anybody else does. I do have a note in my notes from our 8-1 meeting that says 22 foot minimum on drive aisle width, that helps. Yeah, it kept going down, right? It was started at 23 and then it was 22 and then it's 21. Yeah. So I guess the, I should start my video again. The, well, we have five architects on the board. How bad is 21? Is this a, I mean, there's one thing about, there's a difference between misgivings and heartburn and heartburn, we won't do it and misgivings we might, and I'm trying to figure out how to do it. So I guess the question is, how bad is 21? How bad is 21? How bad is 21? We won't do it and misgivings we might, and I'm trying to figure out where we are in the heartburn, misgivings spectrum. My feeling is that if it was 21 feet and it was between two aisles where there were compact cars, it might work because the cars are smaller. But if you had a longer vehicle, 21 feet, you've lost three feet and you have one person parked badly and all of a sudden, you really can't get out anymore. Okay. And they do have 11, I mean, half of their spaces are compact, but not all of them, right? So that still creates that problem. Yeah, and then they also noted somewhere that the location of the compact cars would be determined at the final plan. Nothing is final. Hopefully they would do that in a way to make the geometrics of the parking thing work as well as possible, but.

##### Mr. Riccardelli

Right. Mr. Chair. Mr. Riccardelli. If I can make one suggestion, my only concern about the 21 is really right where you entered the parking garage because it's back-to-back parking, where they had proposed previously 22 feet where it's a single aisle parking up against the back of the project, but that's not really a concern. So I don't want to split hairs here, but we could say where there's back-to-back parking, the minimum aisle width is 22 feet at single loaded drive lanes. We could give them the flexibility to go to 20 feet and that may give them a little bit more room to maneuver because that's typically a standard at single loaded 90 degree parking, 20 feet is acceptable, so. Mr. McCoy, what do you think about that?

##### Mr. McCoy

I think that's perfectly reasonable. I would note on the August 1st drawing set for the civil, they do show 22.3 feet on the single loaded and 23 feet on the double loaded for aisle widths. So not a hundred percent sure why they're requesting it, but we could say, I think what Mr. Riccardelli said is very astute that where it's double loaded, you really want the bigger number, but where it's single loaded, it's not quite as bad because you're not going to hit another person's vehicle, you're just going to hit the wall. So. I would suggest. Mr. Hervity. What I would suggest is that if the plans show a minimum of 22 feet all around, then the waiver should be for 22 feet. If at some point they feel like they need to come in and provide the board revised plans that show a smaller width and have a new request for a waiver, you can consider that as a modification, but I don't think that you should be granting a waiver above and beyond what they're showing on their plans.

##### ?

But that's even though they've specifically asked for it.

##### ?

Correct. They did ask for the 21. But their plans don't show it. Yeah. So if we indicated that they requested 21, but we say the waiver granted to allow a drive aisle of 22 feet as indicated with the approved plans. Right. Okay. So Mr. Hervity, if I could, does this principle apply equally to the bike parking? Because the bike parking, the plans show actually more than they're currently asking for.

##### ?

I 100% agree with that. The waivers should be consistent with the plans. If they want to come back at some point and submit revised plans and ask for a modification, certainly within their right to do so.

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. That sort of has a bearing on our consideration of the earlier issue. Yeah. And I can take a pass at that for next time. I guess we also need to make sure, I mean, I certainly have looked at plans, which said what they had, they have lots of bike plans that they had specifically and so forth. I do, we do need to make sure that if we, I'm not 100% sure that the plans that we've looked at are listed in the approved plans in A2. So we probably, we might want to make sure that we're looking at something that really has plan on it. And it's not just a exhibit for our benefit, but that just means kind of looking back at where, looking at the things that we know are plans and seeing what's illustrated there.

### Loading Zones

##### Patrick Hanlon

All right. So we're now at number eight. Are we? Is it eight? Yes. Number eight. Okay. So Mr. Hafferty, why don't you explain this one?

##### Paul Haverty

Okay. So as I read this provision of the bylaws, it was applicable to parking and loading areas, which are not inside a structure. And my understanding was that the parking for this development is inside a garage. So I don't think it would be applicable and therefore not necessary. Everybody agree with that? Okay. So. The first sentence of that section of the bylaws, all parking and loading areas containing over five spaces, which are not inside a structure. Right. Right. Oh, very clearly not applicable. So, all right.

### Buffer Zones

##### Patrick Hanlon

So then let's get to number nine. And this is similar to that Mr. Hafferty, which is that the parking for parking and loading areas and this is similar to that Mr. Hafferty.

##### Paul Haverty

Yeah, so this section applies to buffers in any industrial or business district that abuts certain buildable residential lots. And I don't believe this abuts any buildable residential lots. So I don't believe that this provision is applicable either. Yeah, I think I did look at the zoning map and all of the lots that are at least immediately adjacent to this plus the lot across the street are either B2A or B4. It might be useful though, I wonder, it might be useful to include language in the description of the sections to include the buildable residential lot point in it because now the reason why it is we don't think it's applicable is not apparent from the reading of the description of the section. Or is that, does that make sense?

##### ?

I think it's only A that's like that but B just refers to a different, to the section that's dealt with in eight, if I'm not mistaken. So we would change that to waiver denied is not applicable to the project, comma, as the property does not abut any buildable residential lots. Okay, I was thinking of putting the buildable residential lots in the text, but either one works fine. Okay.

### Fee Waiver

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay, the next one up is waiver 10 for fees. Mr. Klein, would you want to explain this one?

##### Christian Klein

So the applicant requested a waiver from all fees, which is something that town had done on their project on Westminster Avenue. So we had, Pat and I had approached the town manager and department heads asking if they would be willing to do the same thing here. And they had agreed. And the way the board action listed here is, I believe the text is directly from the town manager's letter. Yes. It isn't a, it isn't a complete clue because of moving clauses around, but all the main language is all familiar. Yeah. Does anyone have any difficulty with granting these waivers?

### Stormwater

##### Patrick Hanlon

All right, so let's go on to 11. 11 is the stormwater bylaw, excuse me, the stormwater bylaw issue. And again, this is, this is one where I'm not looking at the, at the bylaws. So my recollection is I mentioned earlier is that it does not apply the stormwater, the town's stormwater management bylaw does not apply if, unless it's a, unless if you have a certain amount of increased impervious pavement and here there's less than there was before and that, or that it was more than an acre and this is a third of an acre. So the applicant has requested us to say that what is said here on the, in purple and except for the fact that there's two periods at the end of purple, that seems unacceptable, unacceptionable. Does anyone have a, okay, if we're okay on that one,

### Various Waivers

##### Patrick Hanlon

number 12 is one of the few things in all of this that hasn't changed at all. Does anyone propose to change that situation?  Okay, seeing no comments, let's move on to number 13. Now here, it's not clear to me why it is we're dealing with both 13. And 11, since one seems a subset of the other. I think mainly because that's what the applicant requested. So we're simply addressing all of their waiver requests. Okay. May not be strictly necessary if we're granting 13 but. Yeah. Okay. Or 11, 11 is the broader one, right? Cause it. The. Well, then there is one thing. So. I'm looking at, I'm looking at this. So 11 is. The stormwater bylaw. Right. 13 is the stormwater management rules and regulations. So they are different. Documents. Yeah. So you would need separate waivers. Okay. And the reason for the waiver here is that the bylaw that the rules are implementing. Doesn't apply. Okay. So do we just say waiver granted? Or do we want to include something more similar to what we did for 11? Yeah. Yeah, I would, I think that. Well, either one is fine. As long as the way for the, the thing that would be dangerous is to. Not grant the waiver and rely on our interpretation of the stormwater bylaw, and then find that the town manager doesn't agree with that. That would be, that would be a bad result. Okay. Okay.

### Noise Abatement Waiver

##### Patrick Hanlon

So we're really coming down now to the very, I think the very last. Bylaw. The one that's totally new. Not bylaws very last waiver. And this has to do with noise abatement. Mr. Klein.

##### Christian Klein

Yep. So essentially this came about when we were reviewing the. The draft decision. And we were looking for. Noise projects that would allow work to begin at 7 00 AM on weekdays and 8 00 AM on Saturdays. And the applicant indicated they wanted that as well. So. We needed to add this one more. One more waiver request. And they were in agreement. And they were in agreement to grant them the 7 00 AM on weekdays and the 8 00 AM on Saturdays. However, there will be no work on Sundays and holidays. In exchange for that. So, and they agreed to it. So. Just putting that here in writing. So is there any. Does anyone object to that?

### Conditions

##### Patrick Hanlon

Okay. We've come to the end of the waiver. So we've made findings are fact. And. The two hours that I originally. That we try to do. Have expired. And at the wish of, at the risk of. Okay. I wonder if you can take a, if you are willing to take a look. We're next going to conditions. And it turns out that we don't have much work to do on conditions that are sort of at the beginning. It would be nice to get one of the two of the subsections out of the way. Okay. There. And leaving aside. The fact that we don't have much work to do on conditions that are sort of at the beginning of the record. And so that could. That could mean that we'd have to undo or redo some things. We don't really have any. Amendments of. Substance. Okay. I think until we get to a six. Is that right?  Mr. Mr. Klein.

##### Various

That's correct. Just cleaning up. Number four. Okay. Yeah. So a six is again, there's about the. Waving of fees. That. I take it that that should be essentially. There is a war. Yeah, there is a war. We can go ahead and just. Drop that second part. Okay. Okay. Okay. So. Is there anything else in section a. Now in section B. We go back to the original discussion we had. On the. Subsidizing agency. And. There's there's one potential change in, in B one. And otherwise we're with Mr. Okay. I think that. I mean, this was the key condition. This is the one, this is the one that's a condition rather than just. Finding a fact. And. And I think that this is what we've been pulling up for. I think ultimately to me, the most important thing. Is the last. I think the most important thing. Is the final decision. Which is I think a position that we really. To take, and that has been implicit in the decisions we've made. Up to now in the findings fact. Is everybody comfortable with this language?  Okay. Let's take a look at that. Okay. So before changes. Sale to rent up. Okay. So. Let's see, we don't have a whole lot there. No. Either. And the first question and see is whether we ought to require a. Deposit. At the appropriate time, of course. Two. For purposes of peer review, when you go to the. When, when you're doing your final plans. Okay. We have, I think in the past you 6,500, I think that in one of the other cases. I've suggested adding. Not reasonably able and available just to make it clear. It is often true that we have people with technical expertise to do the kind of review that's required here. So. I don't think that's the case. I think the point is we have to use a peer review consultant. Other than that, there's nothing. Very exceptional about this paragraph that I know. Does anyone have any. Discontent with this one. All right. The next. Place where there is a proposed change. So. A brief one in C. Because they are providing street trees. I just wanted to note that. When we're talking about trees that are along. Streets and walkways that they should be salt tolerance. I just wanted to include the word trees. Great. That's all that was. So. Sorry. Wait a minute. We're H right. Although it's, I guess now not H anymore. So H the sewer permits have been changed by the, with different language with respect to the. To. Waiver. And that we don't waiver certain things that we do others. And so. So H is. Itself. Right. And then. J is the deletion of test pits, which should be uncontroversial. Cause they're not doing. Doing this. The original H and the original I are. Essentially the same with a. With some. Change in language. So we're going to strike H and keep the former I, which will become a new IE. Great. Well, I just wanted to, I just wanted to make sure that you all are aware of that. There was a lot of those things which I whizzed on by because there were no proposed changes, but. You all may have had a change and suddenly you've lost your chance. So if there's anything. That you want to draw attention to that. I don't draw attention to. You should certainly feel free to stop and say, wait a minute. Let's let's deal with this. Okay. That takes us. Now to. Yes. So. The 500. Was that for the plan review? Of the. You know, But that is again, wave two is. No, no, no, no. No, this is, this is, this is for us, right? Tom manager waived the fees, but. Okay. So these are all things that would be done anyway, that that would be done through 53 G funding, just as we had Mr. Mr. Now. There's a lot of things that have been postponed. To review of final plans. And so there may very well be work for a peer review consultant. So. The preliminary plans are consistent with the preliminary plans, but the preliminary plans give rise to a certain degree of flexibility. So. Expert advice is apt to be needed. And that's what this is about. It's not part of the fee waivers that. We're agreed to by the. The town manager. You'll set up an account just like we did with Tetra tech and your fund put funds into it. And the only thing about. You know, I don't know if that's the right way to put it in. First. Okay. Right. Mr. Everett. Do I have that basically?  Right. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Okay. All right. So we have now gone through a B and C of the conditions. We did that in 12 minutes. And I'm not planning on pressing my luck. I think that we've done. We can do D. All right. Okay. If that's popular demand, I'm willing to try it. Sure. Let's do D. And D should be pretty easy. The only issue in D is D two part B, which is where we're talking about the property management plan. And I believe the applicant had requested that we strike pet policy for that. And that's what we did. But there were questions that were raised by. Residents about the trash removal policies. So we wanted to make, I felt it was important to maintain that. And there was also questions about smoking policies. So make sure that remained as well. And then there was a. I believe. It was raised. By somebody at the state level. Somebody at the state level as well. Or the. Property management plan. It has to go to the subsidizing agency. Yeah. There was, there was language that. That was proposed by. If I can find it. Okay. And this is on what D. Yeah, what she wanted at the end was the plan shall be submitted after it's approval by the executive office of housing and livability. So. I don't know how that. State first get it approved and then provide it to the town. And I don't know how that. I don't know what the intent was given that this has to be prior to the issues issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Well, they're going to be required to have this. I think as part of their final approval. Submittal. Yeah. Order certainly is fine. Okay. So what they. What she says the plan shall be submitted after it's approval by the executive office. Okay. Pat, if you could just email me that I will swap it in. Okay. We'll do. We'll do. All right. So we did. Okay. So let's, let's take a break. And pick that up.

### Adjournment

##### Patrick Hanlon

We, we went. Seven. 17 minutes. Over time, but we got through four sections. So that that seems like a help that'll make our life. Our lives easier. Next week. Okay. So we've reached the end of the, the agenda for tonight. Not that much really. And next week, we'll come to closure on some of the issues that are outstanding from tonight. Work our way through. The remaining issues. And I hope at least be in a position. To approve a final permit. If not, We'll come back to you. And that is, is. Sort of the meeting is open for any final comments or suggestions. And so let me stop there. If anyone has been itching to say something, this would be the time to say it. And otherwise the chair would entertain a motion. To continue. The deliberation section to. Next Tuesday. September 12th. At seven 30. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Klein. So moved. Second by Mr. DuPont all in favor. All right. I'm going to do a roll call. I have to have to do a recall even for. Yeah. All right. Mr. Klein. Hi. Mr. No, not Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Holy. Hi. Miss Hoffman. Hi. And the chair votes. I, and we are continued. Thank you. Thank you. We didn't need to adjourn. Oh, yep. We do. We do. Well, okay. I, and I second, Mr. Second. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr.  The blank. Mr. Holi. I. Mrs. Hoffman. And we are adjourned. Good night, everybody. Everyone. Good night.
