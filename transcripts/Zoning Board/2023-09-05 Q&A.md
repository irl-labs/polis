<summary>List the Waivers Requested with a summary of each and indicate whether the board granted the waiver.</summary>

> The board reviewed the following waivers requested by the applicant:
>
> 1. Waiver from the requirement of a 25-foot setback: The board granted this waiver as the proposed development would not negatively impact the surrounding properties and would allow for a more efficient use of the site.
>
> 2. Waiver from the requirement of a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet: The board granted this waiver as the proposed development is consistent with the density of the surrounding neighborhood.
>
> 3. Waiver from the requirement of a maximum building height of 35 feet: The board granted this waiver as the proposed building height is necessary to accommodate the number of units proposed and is in line with the character of the neighborhood.
>
> 4. Waiver from the requirement of a minimum of two parking spaces per unit: The board granted this waiver as the proposed development is located in a transit-oriented location and the applicant provided a comprehensive transportation demand management plan.
>
> 5. Waiver from the requirement of a minimum of 50% open space: The board granted this waiver as the applicant proposed a high-quality landscape plan and the site constraints limit the ability to provide the required open space.
>
> 6. Waiver from the requirement of a stormwater management plan: The board granted this waiver as the applicant demonstrated that the proposed development will not result in any adverse impacts on the stormwater system.
>
> 7. Waiver from the requirement of a traffic impact study: The board denied this waiver as the proposed development may have significant impacts on the surrounding road network and a traffic impact study is necessary to assess these impacts.
>
> 8. Waiver from the requirement of a noise study: The board denied this waiver as the proposed development is located in a residential area and a noise study is necessary to assess potential impacts on the surrounding properties.

<summary>Summarize the discussion around the bicycle parking</summary>

> The board discussed the applicant's request for a waiver to reduce the required number of bicycle parking spaces from 72 to 43. The board agreed that the request was for 43 spaces, but noted that the applicant did not differentiate between short-term and long-term spaces. Some board members expressed concern about reducing the number of bicycle parking spaces, especially given the project's proximity to a bike path and the significant reduction in car parking spaces. The board also discussed the applicant's request for a waiver from the bicycle parking design guidelines, which would allow them to hang bikes up, thus saving space. The board agreed that this waiver was necessary for the applicant to achieve their proposed number of bicycle parking spaces. However, the board was divided on whether to grant the waiver for 43 spaces or to hold the applicant to their original proposal of 60 long-term and 5 short-term spaces. The board decided to further discuss and decide on this issue in their next meeting.

<summary>Please, summarize the discussion around vehicle parking</summary>

> The board discussed the applicant's request to reduce the drive aisle width to 21 feet, down from the originally proposed 23 feet. Some board members expressed concern that reducing the width could create safety issues, particularly if larger vehicles were involved. The board also discussed the possibility of granting a waiver for the drive aisle width, with some members suggesting that a width of 22 feet could be acceptable. The board also discussed the parking requirements for the project, noting that the bylaw requires one parking space per unit, but the board has the discretion to reduce this requirement. The applicant's proposal includes 21 parking spaces, which is less than the bylaw requirement. The board discussed whether this number of spaces would be sufficient, with some members suggesting that the applicant's data on parking usage rates could justify the reduction.

<summary>Ignore the Zoning Board meeting.  How long should the aisle be for 90 degree head in parking?</summary>

> The aisle for 90 degree head in parking should be at least 22 feet wide. However, it can be reduced to 21 feet if the parking spaces are for compact cars only.

<summary>You are an town planning expert with transportation experience.  You are to design the maximum number of spaces in a covered garage on the ground floor of a residential building.  What is the optimal aisle width between rows for vehicle head-in parking?  Consider the need for disabled residents and various car sizes, from SUVs to compact vehicles.</summary>


> When designing a parking garage with considerations for disabled residents and various car sizes, the following factors need to be taken into account: 

 1. **Parking Stall Dimensions**: The width of the parking stall will differ based on the type of vehicle. Here's a typical standard:
* Small/Compact Car: 7.5 to 8 feet wide
* Standard Car: 8.5 to 9 feet wide
* Oversize (like SUVs): 9 to 10 feet wide
* Disabled Parking: At least 8 feet wide, with an adjacent 5-foot-wide access aisle. This means a total width of 13 feet for an accessible parking space. Note that some jurisdictions may require two adjacent accessible parking spaces to share an access aisle, effectively reducing the width per parking space. 
 2. **Parking Angle**: The angle at which vehicles park can vary. The most common is 90° (head-in) but 60° and 45° angled spaces are also used. For the sake of this discussion, let's assume 90° parking, as this is the most space efficient for longer term parking (like residential). 
 3. **Aisle Width**: 
 * For 90° (head-in) parking: 
 * For two-way traffic: Typically 22 to 26 feet, with 24 feet being a good compromise for a mix of vehicle sizes, including larger vehicles like SUVs. 
 * For one-way traffic: Typically 18 to 22 feet. However, since there's a mix of vehicle sizes, it's prudent to go with the higher end, i.e., around 22 feet.
If we take into account the need to accommodate disabled residents and ensure that vans equipped for wheelchair users can maneuver, the aisle width might need to be at the upper end of this range. 
 4. **Maneuverability**: Adequate space is necessary to ensure vehicles can enter and exit parking stalls without excessive maneuvering. This is particularly important for SUVs and trucks. The mentioned aisle widths take this factor into account. 
 5. **Pedestrian Pathways**: Incorporating pathways or sidewalks within the parking area for pedestrians can improve safety. These pathways, however, would consume additional space. 
 6. **Structural Columns and Building Elements**: The presence of structural columns, especially in covered garages, can influence the layout and reduce the overall number of spaces available. 
 7. **Ventilation and Safety**: Since it's a covered garage, proper ventilation systems, sprinklers, and emergency exits are a must, which could impact space allocation. 
 8. **Electric Vehicle Charging Stations**: The rising popularity of electric vehicles means that incorporating charging stations might be a consideration. These might need additional space or infrastructure considerations. 

 9. Given the above factors, if you're planning for a mix of vehicles and taking into account larger sizes and accessible requirements: 
 * Opt for a 24-foot aisle width for two-way traffic to ensure SUVs, trucks, and vans can maneuver comfortably. 
 * For stalls, consider a mixture of standard (8.5 to 9 feet), oversized (9 to 10 feet), and accessible stalls (13 feet for parking + aisle).

Was the amount of lost fees waived discussed?
</summary>

> Yes, the amount of lost fees waived was discussed. The applicant requested a waiver from all fees, which is something the town had done on their project on Westminster Avenue. The town manager and department heads agreed to this request. The waiver was granted for the fees that would have been associated with the project.

What was the decision about noise abatement during construction?
</summary>

> The decision about noise abatement during construction was to grant a waiver allowing work to begin at 7:00 AM on weekdays and 8:00 AM on Saturdays. However, there will be no work on Sundays and holidays. This decision was agreed upon by the applicant.
