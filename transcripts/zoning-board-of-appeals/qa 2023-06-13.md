</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the meeting.</summary>

> The meeting began with an administrative item regarding a previous case, which was approved. The main business of the meeting was the continuation of a public hearing for the 10 Sunny Side application. The applicant's team, including representatives from Utile, Sammy Otis, and Offshoots, presented updates on the site civil drawings and landscape design plan. The board also discussed the height of a nearby building on Broadway and Sunnyside, but did not have an exact answer. The meeting ended with a motion to adjourn.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the administrative item.</summary>

> The administrative item was the approval of a written decision for a case regarding 12 Puritan Road. The board discussed and made some minor changes to the draft decision before approving it. There was no public comment on this item.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the discussion concerning 10 Sunnyside Avenue.</summary>

> The discussion concerned the proposed development at 10 Sunnyside Avenue, which is a 5-story affordable housing project. The height of the building was a major concern for some of the neighbors, but the applicant stated that it is within the zoning requirements and is necessary for the project to be financially feasible. The landscape architects presented plans for the streetscape and a native plant habitat around the building. There was also a discussion about the shadow study and its impact on neighboring properties, including concerns about shading on houses with solar panels. The board voted to continue the hearing to July 11th to further discuss the civil and transportation aspects of the project.
</details><details><summary>Who spoke about the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project?</summary>

> Multiple people spoke about the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project, including the chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals, representatives from the architectural and landscape architecture firms working on the project, and a resident of Michael Street who expressed concerns about the height of the building and its impact on neighboring properties.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the presentation by Rochelle concerning 10 Sunnyside Avenue project.</summary>

> Rochelle presented revised design materials for the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project, including architectural and landscape plans. The site is currently devoid of vegetation and the proposed landscape plan includes a native plant and bird habitat mix around the building. The streetscape plan includes five new street trees and smaller ornamental trees with native species plantings. The height of the building is not seeking any waivers and is a matter of right in the zoning district. The shadow study was done at select intervals, but the data captured is relevant to the extreme ends of conditions. There was a discussion with the LA Neighbors Coalition regarding concerns about the Alewife Broadway intersection and potentially adding a walkway. The applicant submitted written comments and responses to the town's comments.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the presentation by Kate Kennan concerning the landscape plan for the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project.</summary>

> Kate Kennan from Offshoots presented the landscape architecture plan for the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project. The site is currently devoid of vegetation and the plan includes a native plant and bird habitat mix around the building as a buffer screening with tall vertical trees. The streetscape in the front will have five new street trees and smaller ornamental trees closer to the building, all of which will be native species. The existing streetscape at Sunnyside has a 6.5 foot walkway, a 25 foot 6 inch street, and street tree pits that are three feet wide, three feet six with the curb, and a four foot area that can be crossed behind the trees. The placement of the street trees was considered to have good flow of pedestrian access and to keep good direct access into the building doors for when there are drop-offs along the street. The presentation did not mention any specific dimensions or measurements.
</details><details><summary>What questiosn were asked about the choice of plants for the landscape?</summary>

> Mr. Dupont asked if the plants were selected taking into account the amount of sunlight that each face will receive, and Mr. Riccardelli asked if the three-foot wide planting strip for street trees was adequate for the size of tree that would be expected there.
</details><details><summary>What was the concern expressed by the resident concerning the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project?</summary>

> The resident expressed concern about the height of the building and its impact on the neighborhood, as well as the shading and economic impact on neighboring properties with solar panels. They also asked about the placement and screening of a transformer on the property, drainage connections, and ADA access to the front entrance of the building.
</details><details><summary>What were Monique Chaplain questions?</summary>

> Monique Chaplain had two questions: one was about the possibility of people climbing the bricks that stick out to get up to the roof deck, and the other was about whether there would be flood lighting on the roof or on the sides that may impact the people living around at night.
</details><details><summary>What were Christian Klein's concerns?</summary>

> Christian Klein had concerns about the impact of the building on solar studies and suggested a quantitative approach to understanding the overall impact. He also asked about the feasibility of a four-story building instead of a five-story building and what the consequences would be. He suggested the possibility of using stormwater storage for irrigation purposes and asked about the placement of street trees in relation to the drop-off/pickup area.
