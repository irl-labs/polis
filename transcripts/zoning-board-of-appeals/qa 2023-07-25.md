<details><summary>Please, summarize the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.</summary>

> The Zoning Board of Appeals meeting, chaired by Christian Klein, was held on Tuesday, July 25, 2023. The meeting began with a roll call of members and officials, including Roger DuPont, Patrick Hanlon, Dan Rickardelli, and Adam LeBlanc. The board's administrator, Colleen Ralston, was also present. The meeting was conducted remotely in accordance with an act signed into law on March 29, 2023, which extended the provision for remote meetings until March 31, 2025.

The board first discussed the case of 18 Robin Hood Road, where the homeowners, Joseph and Caroline, wanted to convert the second floor of their garage into an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). After reviewing the plans and considering the neighborhood context, the board voted in favor of approving the ADU, subject to standard conditions and additional conditions related to the submission of final plans.

The board then moved on to administrative matters, approving written decisions for 60 High Heath Road and 61 Aerial Street, and approving minutes from previous meetings. The board also discussed an upcoming special meeting.

The meeting concluded with the board discussing a case involving a proposed addition to a home on Oakland Avenue. The board considered whether the addition constituted an extension of a non-conforming use and whether it met the criteria for a large addition. After discussion, the board voted in favor of approving the addition, subject to standard conditions.

</details><details><summary>What was the land acknowledgment read at the beginning of the meeting?</summary>

> The land acknowledgment read at the beginning of the meeting recognized that the town of Arlington, Massachusetts, where the zoning Board of Appeals operates, is located on the ancestral lands of the Massachusetts tribe, the tribe of indigenous peoples from whom the colony, province, and Commonwealth have taken their names.

</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the 18 Robin Hood Road project.</summary>

> The 18 Robin Hood Road project involves the conversion of the second floor of a garage into an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). The garage was recently rebuilt on the property and the owners, Joe and Caroline, plan to use the ADU as a long-term rental or for family use. The board discussed the need for the ADU to have an exit that goes directly outside, rather than through the garage, to meet building code requirements. The total square footage of the ADU is just under 600 feet, and the main house is approximately 2200 square feet. The project is being conducted remotely in accordance with an act signed into law on March 29, 2023, which allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely.
</details><details><summary>What concerns were raised for the 18 Robin Hood Road project?  How did Joe respond?</summary>

> Concerns were raised about the exit from the accessory dwelling unit not going directly to the outside, but only to the garage. There were also questions about the square footage of the dwelling unit and whether it meets the requirements of the ADU. Additionally, there were concerns about the removal of trees during the construction of the garage. Joe responded by saying that he was not aware of the requirement for the exit to go directly outside and suggested two possible solutions: cutting into the deck to put a full-size door there, or putting up a wall to separate the garage and create an entryway. He confirmed that the square footage of the dwelling unit is just under 600 feet and that the main house is approximately 2200 square feet. Regarding the trees, he explained that one tree had been removed years before the construction because it was dying and posed a risk to utility lines, and another had to be removed recently because it was dead.
</details><details><summary>What was the boards decision regarding 18 Robin Hood Road?</summary>

> The board approved the application for 18 Robin Hood Road, allowing the conversion of the upper floor of the garage into an accessory dwelling unit. The approval was subject to the three standard conditions and the requirement that the exit from the accessory dwelling unit does not go directly to the garage but to the outside.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the issue concerning the garage at 18 Robin Hood Road?</summary>

> The issue concerning the garage at 18 Robin Hood Road is that the homeowners, Joe and Caroline, are seeking to convert the second floor of their garage into an accessory dwelling unit (ADU). The garage was built in 2021 and the second floor is currently unfinished. The homeowners are either planning to rent out the ADU or use it as a space for their son. However, there are concerns about the exit from the ADU, which currently only leads to the garage. The board has suggested that the homeowners need to modify the exit so that it leads directly outside. There are also questions about the size of the ADU and whether it meets the requirements of the bylaw. The board also received an email from a neighbor expressing opposition to the plan.
</details><details><summary>Summarize the ADU (accessory dwelling unit) bylaw as described by Klein.</summary>

> The ADU bylaw allows for the rental of an accessory dwelling unit as long as the primary residence is still occupied by an owner of the property. The bylaw also states that the conversion of an existing structure to an accessory dwelling unit must not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than its current use. The bylaw also requires that the accessory dwelling unit must be a minimum of six feet from the property line. The bylaw also states that the accessory dwelling unit must comply with all applicable requirements of state building codes and state fire codes. The bylaw also requires that the final plans and specifications approved by the board for the permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington. There should be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington zoning board of appeals.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the Oakland Avenue project.</summary>

> The Oakland Avenue project involves homeowners David and Catherine seeking to add an extension to their existing three-story home, which was built in 1939. The extension is not within the existing foundation, which differentiates it from a similar case at 48 Oakland Avenue. The homeowners are seeking relief under subparagraph B of the zoning bylaw, arguing that their non-conformity has existed since the house was built and that the proposed addition would not be more detrimental to the neighborhood than the current non-conformity. The proposed addition is also considered a large addition, requiring special attention to setbacks and proximity to neighboring structures. The addition will be built behind the structure and away from the street, maintaining a substantial rear setback. The project has received support from many neighbors and no opposition has been voiced.
</details><details><summary>What concerns were raised for the Oakland Ave project?</summary>

> The main concern raised for the Oakland Ave project was whether the proposed addition was introducing a new non-conformity or whether it was an extension of an existing non-conformity. This depended on whether the existing house was considered two stories or three stories. The building inspector viewed it as a three-story building, but this was a point of contention. There was also discussion about whether the addition was completely within the foundation of the existing structure, which would potentially not require zoning relief. The board also considered whether the addition would fit into the neighborhood and whether it would be more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing non-conformity.
</details><details><summary>How was the conforming use issue of the current Oakland Ave dwelling resolved?</summary>

> The conforming use issue of the current Oakland Ave dwelling was resolved by applying Section 8.1.3B of the zoning bylaw, which governs the extension of a non-conforming use. The board found that the existing house was a three-story structure, making it a non-conforming use. However, the proposed extension was deemed not more detrimental to the neighborhood than the current non-conformity. Therefore, the board approved the extension under both Section 8.1.3B and Section 5.4.2B6, which pertains to large additions.
