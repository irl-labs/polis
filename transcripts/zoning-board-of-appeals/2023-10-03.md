<details><summary>Agenda</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 324</summary>

> So tonight we have six items on the agenda. And I'm going to just briefly I'm going to take them in a very specific order and I'm just going to explain what that is now. So first, will be to 12 Pleasant Street. That is because they are just going to be continued straight away. Then we will take 106 Mount Vernon Street. Then 32 Appleton Street. Five Mystic Lake Drive 77 Tanager Street 15 moccasin path, and then we'll do the administrative items at the end. I anticipate that we will be getting to five mystically drive around 915. So if you are here for a later hearing, please feel free to step away and check back in at that time I can provide better time estimates at that time. If you are five mystically drive 77 tangible 15 moccasin path, I promise we will not start you until after 915. I just offer that to you now if you want to step away and come back in. That is perfectly fine. I don't want to take up everyone's whole night. Thank you for the heads up on that. Absolutely. So with that, we're going to go straight ahead to public hearings. So before opening the public hearings here are some ground rules for effective and clear conduct of tonight's business. After I announced each agenda item I will ask the applicants to introduce themselves for themselves and make their presentation to the board. I will then request that members of the board, ask what questions they have on a proposal, and after the board's questions have been answered, I will open the meeting for public comment. At the conclusion of public comment the board will deliberate and vote on the matter. Any vote taken at this hearing will be preliminary until the written decision is approved by the board at a subsequent meeting. All votes will be conducted by roll call vote.

<details><summary>Docket #3765 Appeal of the Bldg Inspector Decision on 106 Mt Vernon Street</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 82</summary>

> That brings us to item number four on our agenda this evening. Docket 3765, appeal of the building inspector in regards to decision on 106, excuse me, Mount Vernon Street. I would ask that the appellant please address the board. And I know that there was as a part of the appeal to the board there was a question about the suitability of some of the zoning board of appeals members so if you could go ahead and address that first please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 388</summary>

> Good evening, Mr. Chairman members of the board. My name is Carl to main I represent Gail Caucasian Edwin Schmidt Scott tower and Virginia tower. The appellants in this matter. I had an opportunity to opportunity to review the town council's opinion with regard to recusal. And we will accept that opinion as written. Thank you very much appreciate that. So if you go with that. The basically the appeal, we're going to be hearing in two parts tonight. The first has to do with the timeliness of the application of the appeal. And once that has been discussed, we will then decide on whether we want to continue on to the merits. Depending on the timeliness question so with that, Mr chairman I'll turn it back over to you. And if you could explain the situation. I would like to first state, I don't know if the board received a memorandum which I had emailed earlier today, but I think there are two preliminary procedural issues. First is whether or not there was a timely appeal. And the second assuming that the appeal was not timely filed whether the appellants receive had actual notice of the building permit being issued. So, with regard to the timeliness of the appeal itself. There are a number of questions that we would need answers to in order to basically determine whether or not the appeal was timely filed. We are in receipt of two building permits building permit number 2023 dash 1162 and building permit number 08299. The Director of Inspection Services, Mr Siampa had indicated that the building permit 20231162, which is the building permit that appears on the town website and has a has a date of July. July 7 as the issuing date was in fact not correct that when the permit was uploaded to the town system. The date of issue got changed. But I need to note that the date of issue on. Not only was the date of issue changed on what was uploaded but the permit number was changed from what the building inspector has indicated was the permit. And the font also changed. So my question is, how can those changes occur when a document is scanned for uploading. And are they in fact the same document or are they different permits.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 45</summary>

> Thank you for that question. With us this evening. We do have Michael champion, who is the Director of Inspectional Services for the town of Arlington. I would ask Mr Siampa if he could explain the difference between the two issuances of the building permit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 144</summary>

> Yeah, of course, they are the same permit one is a digitally created one from the permit system that is created when the permit is scanned into the system and one is the actual building card that is issued to to the applicant, the we've just recently gone online but our prior system defaulted to the date that the permit applications were scanned into the system as the as the permit date so that that's the differences and the difference in the number is that when the permit is scanned into the system. I'm sorry when the permit is issued to the applicant, it does not yet have an actual permit number the permit number that it is given is the invoice number. So that's why in the system there is a separate different number than on the permit card that the applicant receives.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 23</summary>

> Okay, and when the permit is issued is put into the electronic system. Do you scan the permit card or is the information.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 94</summary>

> The card itself is not that's correct in the old system the information was entered manually. There was no. There was no function to it that allowed us to take the building card that we would issue to the applicants and have it be identical in the system. Additionally, the digital permit serves a purpose of being able to input the inspections we wouldn't be able to do that with just with a scanned copy it's it's actually part of the program, or was part of the program when we were using that system.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 114</summary>

> Thank you. So the application. And for the appeal of the decision to building specter to issue the building permit for one of six Mount Vernon Street, the appeal was filed on August 3, which is the reason that there's this question because there's a 30 day period. And that this date is between June 6, which excuse me June 26 which I believe was the original date on the written permit and written permit, and then July 7 is the one that came out of the electronic system which would have been. That would have been a less than 30 days so this is the sort of the crux of the issue here.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 41</summary>

> Mr Chairman, if I could ask one, if you want additional questions of director. Absolutely, please. Yeah. So, director sample when, when did you have knowledge that the documents that were uploaded to the town website changed the date of issuance.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 104</summary>

> We were never asked whether they changed the date of issuance. Well, in your response to the appellants appeal you indicated that the, the online system automatically change the date of issuance to the day that was uploaded my question to you is did you have knowledge that that's what occurred when the documents uploaded prior to your. That's a function of the system it's it defaults to the date that it's scanned in my question to you is when did you have knowledge that that's what occurs when I get scanned in that the day I was, I was never asked that question.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 16</summary>

> Well, I'm asking whether you asked that I'm asking did you have knowledge that that occurs.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 14</summary>

> That's been occurring since the system was created in the early in the 90s.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 15</summary>

> I would, I would just ask that all questions be addressed through the chair, please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 29</summary>

> So I guess my question is, at what point in time to direct a sample know that when permits are scanned into the system, the date of issue changes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 8</summary>

> I think I've answered that question seven times.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 122</summary>

> Thank you. So Mr. I think what I'm a ship has said is that the, the department has been aware that the date that is registered in the online system is the date that it's entered into the online system, which they know is different than the date that is written on the building card when the permit is form is issued. My next question, then Mr chairman is a two part question. One. If Mr sample was aware of the fact that the date gets changed. Why did he refer refer the appellants to the online system. And to why didn't Mr sample provide the building permit that was issued as part of the response to the appellants request for information.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 142</summary>

> Mr Tampa. I was just going to say so the second question, the second part of that question, my understanding and I'll ask Mr Tampa to corroborate, is that the reason that they've written building card with the June date was not in the file was that that was already posted on the job site. The date that it was given to the contractor, it was posted on the front door of the property, as is required. That is correct. Able to get a copy as to incorporate into his denial. I was never even asked by the appellants when the permit was on the day that the public records request was filed if the permanent been issued yet I would have answered yes it has and I would have provided the date. I was never asked when the permit was issued.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 1235</summary>

> I just like to, Mr. Chair, thank you, all, all questions and all responses should be directed through the chair directly. Okay. So the business domain, are you aware of whether anyone went to look at the building card that was posted on the property. I am not aware. Okay. Mr Chairman, which brings us to the second procedural issue. It's a question of whether the appeal was timely. And if in fact the the appeal was not timely then there's a secondary issue of whether or not the appellants had adequate notice or actual notice that the permit issue. That's relevant because to the extent they did not have adequate notice that they would have appeal rights under chapter 48 section seven. And we, the appellants have in fact submitted a request for zoning enforcement seven to the director. So, I think it's worth noting that, and it's our contention that the appellants did not have adequate or actual notice that the building permit issue, because all the despite the numerous requests for information concerning one, the permit, whether the permanent been issued. Whether or not the permanent been issued. documents produced concerning the application of the permit, all were non-responsive or contained incorrect information. There is a litany of due diligence that the appellants took in trying to determine whether or not the building permit had in fact issued. And I would like to just go over a number of those for the record. At the special permit and variance hearing for ZBA docket number 3737, the appellants made it known that they intended to appeal the issuance of a building permit. On June 21st, 2023, the appellant sent an email to the director and David Geldart in the Inspectional Services Department, stating that if someone could let them know when a permit issued for the proposed project at 106 Mount Vernon Street, they would appreciate it. They're aware of the fact that the permit date determines the time for filing an appeal. On June 22nd, 2023, the appellants received the only response to the above request sent by Mr. Geldart, stating the permit has not been issued. We are awaiting additional information. When the department advised the appellants that no permit had issued, it is our contention that the department had a duty to inform the appellants when in fact that permit issued. The appellants had the right to expect that the issuance of the permit, upon the issuance of the permit, they would be notified. On June 28th, 2023, the appellants noticed the start of excavation work at 106 Mount Vernon Street and visited the department the same day. On June 28th, the appellants asked the officials in the department whether the excavation work they observed was allowed. Response was, it was. At no time did the response say that the building permit issue, merely that excavation was being permitted. The excavation activity that the appellants observed is not necessarily evidence of a building permit. Under the State Building Code, the State Building Code allows the building inspector to issue excavation permits and specifically states that the property owner undertaking the excavation does so at their own peril, to the extent that the building permit does not get issued. On June 28th, the appellants again requested from the department, final plans, permits, et cetera. And when informed, a copy of the file from the department would be available the following day when the administrative staff, Kerry, would be back in the office. On June 29th, the appellants again returned to the Inspectional Services Department to pick up the promised documents and the director inexplicably stated that he could only provide the requested documents in response to a formal public records request made on the town website. The director further stated that if the appellant submitted such a request, he will copy the entire file and send it to the appellants. Appellants immediately in the Inspectional Services parking lot sent an email request to James Feeney, then the deputy town manager, pursuant to the mass public records request law, requesting a copy of the application plans and building permit for current work at 106 Mount Vernon Street. On June 30th, 2023, Mr. Feeney responded that the director would compile a response of records for the appellant. On July 5th, 2023, appellants sent another email to the director asking when appellants would receive the responsive records. On July 6th, the director responded by email stating in full, I have attached the files you requested. The application will be scanned into the system tomorrow. On July 6th, 2023, the director omitted documents in his possession from the documents produced by him contrary to his obligation pursuant to the mass public records request law. In his representation to the appellants that he will provide the entire building file. It is significant to note and curious that the supplied documents omitted from the documents requests are those documents upon which the appeal is based, namely the different dates found on several purported building permits. The director directed the appellants to the town website to obtain a copy of the building permit upon which the appellants relied in filing their appeal. The documents produced by the director included no building permit. It did not include either of the documents the ZBA administrator in the email of August 3rd relied on to assert that the appellant's appeal was untimely. Those documents were the receipt and the original building permit. On July 7th, the application of building permit were posted with the building permit clearly marked July 7th, 2003 as the date of issue and a different permit number than the permit originally issued on June 26th. Appellants having relied on the director's instructions to obtain a copy of the building permit online further relied on that permit in its date of issue for their appeal. Thereafter and incomprehensibly, the director stated the preposterous position that the applicant cannot rely on the online records because the online system purportedly changes dates. While the director takes the position that the online system is unreliable as to dates and provides no explanation of whether the online system is equally unreliable as to permit numbers in the font of the online permit. Appellants did not receive a copy of the alleged building permit issued on June 26th until the director's denial of their appeal. It's important to note that the director clearly had a copy of the permit and application and they were withheld from appellants. Because the appellants previously informed the director of appellant's intentional appeal and request the relevant permit and issue date, it appears that they were withheld in an effort to frustrate the appellant's appeal. The appellants had no reason to question the date of issuance on the online permit number 2023-1162 as the date the building permit was issued. By letter directed to August 10th, the appellants requested zoning enforcement under chapter 48, section seven. And this is why this chronology is relevant because to the extent that the board finds that the permit, the appeal of the permit was not timely, there's a question of fact as to whether or not the appellants had actual or adequate notice and to the extent it was constructive notice, did they diligently pursue information to ascertain the date of issuance? And I would submit that they did. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 58</summary>

> Let's have a couple of quick questions. So you had said that there was a request to back at June 28th request to, excuse me, to see the plans. At that time, was the request made to have a copy made that could be taken or was the request just to see the documents? Do you know that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 68</summary>

> It was a in-person request at the planning, at the inspectional services department over the counter that they'd be provided with copies of the file. And they were told that they could come back on June 29th when Kerry was in the office to obtain that. They returned back on June 29th and they were told, sorry, we can't give it to you, submit a request for information.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 40</summary>

> On June 26th, the date that the excavation began, you say that the appellants had come down to the inspectional services to ask about the excavation. Do you know if they specifically asked if a building permit had been issued?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 46</summary>

> On June 28th, they went down and asked whether the activity taking place, the excavation was allowed and they were told it was. Okay, but they didn't ask specifically if a building permit had issued. Not that day, they did ask for it on June 29th.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein, Carl Toumayan, Michael Ciampa - 273</summary>

> Okay, so June 29th, they asked if the building permit had issued, you're saying? Yes. Okay, and at that time had they been told that a building permit had issued? I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman, they asked for a copy that day. Oh, okay, and during this time, do you know if anyone went to see if a billing card was posted on the job site? They did not. Okay. And then you had noted that there were documents that were omitted, one you said was the original permit and what were the other documents you say were omitted? The receipt, the alleged receipt that was given for the payment of the permit fee. Okay. Okay, and then you say you were not provided a copy of the original building card until after August 3rd? Correct, it was provided with the building inspector's denial. Okay. So I would ask Mr. Shampa, when the request was made at the end of June 29th for the card, did you have a copy of the card available in the office or was the only copy on the door of the residence? That's correct, we did not have it in our possession. Okay. And what is the usual amount of time it takes to prepare a copy of a file for distribution? So no files are allowed to be provided without a public records request to begin with. And we were provided with 10 business days to fulfill that request. Okay. Thank you for that. I'll turn to the board and ask if the board has questions. I've sort of been monopolizing the floor here for a bit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 84</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. So I have a couple of questions for Mr. Shampa. So in the chronology that's provided by Attorney Tumey and in his brief, he lays out the fact that there was an email to inspectional services, I believe, to you and Mr. Geldart saying, let us know when a permit is issued. Other than that email on June 21st, were there any other emails to you requesting an update as to whether or not the building permit had been issued?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa and Roger Dupont - 334</summary>

> Not that I'm aware of. And then Mr. Geldart on the following day, June 22nd, wrote back and said that the permit had not been issued. Are you aware of that? I may be, but the permit had not been issued on this 22nd. Okay. And to your knowledge, was there any other email communication about the permit having been issued or not having been issued to the appellants? Not that I'm aware of. Okay. And then, so just to continue along on the procedure. So on June 23rd, the building permit was approved, but the card itself wasn't issued until the check had been paid, the fee had been paid. Is that correct? That's correct. And so the card itself then was handed to the contractor who then posted it on the job site. And then on the 28th, the appellants came to Inspectional Services asking whether the excavation was allowed. And do you know who spoke to them at that time? I do not. Okay. And in the brief by Mr. Tameyan, he says that they were informed that the excavation was in fact allowed. Are you aware of them having questioned on that date whether the permit itself had been issued? I am not. And then on the 29th, they came back and presumably because they were looking for copies of the file. And do you know who spoke to them on that occasion? I actually spoke with them on that occasion. And at that time, did they ask you whether the building permit had been issued?  They did not. And I assume that they already knew because they said they were asking for all of the files for the current work occurring at the property. Okay. And on that occasion, did they ask to see the file for, cause the file for the address? They did not want to see the file. They just wanted a copy. Okay. And those are my only questions for the moment, Mr. Chairman.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 38</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Dupont. Are there other questions from other members of the board? Okay. Seeing none. Mr. Duman, did you have anything further in regards to either the question about timeliness or the question about adequate notice?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 30</summary>

> I just want to correct the record. I believe someone had mentioned that the appellants had filed their appeal on August 3rd. Actually, their appeal was filed on August 1.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 172</summary>

> Okay. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. So this is a public hearing, right? And the question before the board is whether the, at this point is twofold, is one is whether the application was submitted submitted in a timely fashion. And the second question is, was adequate notice provided to the appellant in regards to the date of the issuance of the permit? Because this is a public hearing, the public is allowed to participate and ask questions, but only as they relate to the matter at hand. So the matter specifically at hand right now is, are those two items and related to the questions that the board has been following? So if there are members of public who want to address those two questions, you can raise your hand using the raise hand button on the reactions tab in the Zoom application, or if you're on phone, you can dial star nine. Are there any members of public who wish to speak to these questions? Let's see, one, Mr. Fitzsimmons.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Bruce Fitzsimmons - 833</summary>

> Thank you, and good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board. My name is Bruce Fitzsimmons. I live at 122 Mount Vernon Street, which is three houses away from the property at 106 Mount Vernon Street. By way of full disclosure, I'm also an attorney and I've represented the homeowners, Sean and Bailey Snyder, both when they purchased 106 Mount Vernon Street and when they sold their former home at 113 Mount Vernon Street. I've also provided them with legal advice pertaining to tonight's hearing. I've previously submitted written comments to the board and I will try my best to restrict my oral comments to only matters not addressed in writing previously. Has the chairs recognized that the heart of the hearing tonight is the question of when was the building permit actually issued by the building department? The appellants wish to keep the focus on this as to when they learned about it, but the statutory provisions in chapter 40A, section seven, eight, and 15, and the relevant case law clearly says that it is the time that the appeal, excuse me, the time of permit was issued that starts the clock. And the 30 day time period for filing the appeal is strictly enforced. If the appeal is not made timely, at that point, the board and any court who might hear a subsequent appeal would have no subject matter jurisdiction over this matter. With respect to the question about the adequacy of notice, the court cases don't give us a bright line test of what would constitute adequate notice, but in the leading case on this matter, which is Connors versus Annino, and which I've cited in my written comments, the Supreme Judicial Court determined that the appellant's receipt of actual notice of the issue of a permit 10 days after the permit had been issued, and therefore 20 days prior to the expiration of a 30 day appeal period would be sufficient to qualify as adequate notice. I would submit to the board that in this case, the appellants actually had at least 24 days notice prior to the clock running out on their appeal period, because their email to the building inspector and to, I believe, then the acting town manager on the 29th indicated that they had some knowledge that a building permit had issued. I also want to address comments in Mr. Tumeyan's petition that perhaps the permit that was initially issued and given to the Snyders was a build, excuse me, a foundation permit or something less than a full building permit. And. And I think if you turn to the building card, which is at page 13 of the packet, it's very clear on the face of it that it's the purpose of the permit was to add an additional dwelling unit to property and decks. There's nothing on the face of this permit that would limit its applicability to excavation work or constructing a foundation. I will accept that the date of issuance, well, I would submit that the date of issuance on the card is June 23rd, but with respect to starting the clock, I think I would defer to the building inspector's comment that it began on June 26th when the permit was paid. Now, I also take note that the fee amount that was charged, which was over $7,000, would be in excess of what you would typically expect for a foundation permit. So what the town was charging my clients was the fee for the entire project. I would like to address also briefly the comment in town council's memorandum to the board. Most of which I would agree with, but there's one suggestion that the board can entertain hearing the merits of the case without deciding whether or not the appeal is timely. I apologize if I'm misconstruing town council's point on this, but I would lead you back to the Connors decision and state that not only is that time limit for filing an appeal strictly enforced with the 30 days, but the courts have consistently held that failure to meet that timing deadline deprives the board of appeals or any court that might hear this matter of subject matter jurisdiction. So at best, listening to the merits of this case without deciding whether or not the appeal is timely would be an academic exercise. At worst, it could put the board in violation of Massachusetts case law. So in conclusion, I would just say that there's sufficient evidence here for the board to find that the appellants had received adequate notice, that a permit had issued on or about June 23rd or June 26th, whichever date you choose for the issuance of the permit would still be more than 30 days from the initial filing of the notice of appeal on August 1st. So therefore, for those reasons, the board should dismiss the appeal and not hear the arguments as to the merits. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 26</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I would ask Mr. Cunningham if he's able to comment on the point that was raised by Mr. Fitzsimmons about the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 123</summary>

> If the board decides that the appeal was not timely, that the board should stay away from discussing the merits of the application. The way I read Attorney Heim's opinion is that the board could, if it chose to, may also address the merits further but are not so required. I think that's the section that counsel is referring to. I think that the most clean, I'm not saying that they would run afoul of the Connors' decision. I don't think that's necessarily true and I don't think that Attorney Fitzsimmons said that's certain. However, I do think that if the board determines that the appeal is untimely, the most clean way to deal with this appeal would to make no further inquiry.

> Great, thank you very much. Are there any other members of the public who wish to address this? We have a second name, Francesca Colterra. Yes. If you could just give your name and address for the record, please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Francesca Colterra - 120</summary>

> My name is Francesca Colterra. I live on 100 Citrus Street in Arlington. I'm kind of sitting here as a non-lawyer and trying to get my head around the idea that you could, as a citizen of Arlington, repeatedly ask, has a permit been issued? And repeatedly ask what's going on and not get a straight answer. And that's really what it seems to come down to from where I'm sitting. In addition to which, the idea that you have 10 business days to file something, 10 business days is two weeks, so I'm thinking you're not giving people a lot of time if they're not getting a straight and simple answer on when the permit was filed. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 104</summary>

> Thank you. I would just note that the appeal period, it's actually a 30-day appeal period. I believe what Mr. Fitzsimmons had mentioned in the Connors decision was that the town giving notice 10 days after the issuance of the permit, which would then reduce the time you had to 20 days, that in the Connors decision, that it was found that those 20 days was still a sufficient period of time to apply, but your points are very well taken. Thank you so much. Here's a thought. Are there any other members of the public who wish to address the board? Director Ciampa?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ciampa - 56</summary>

> Yes, I won't take up much of your time. There's not enough hours in the evening for me to correct all of the inaccuracies in the previous statements. I can't say that no one in our office was asked, has the permit been issued yet, after the date of the permit being issued?  Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 43</summary>

> Okay, is there anyone else who wishes to address this?  Otherwise, I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment period for this hearing. Seeing no one else, I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment for this hearing.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul and Marcy Tannenbaum - 149</summary>

> This is Paul and Marcy Tannenbaum. I'm trying to put my raised hand, but I'm having trouble getting it notified. I'm sorry, I didn't recognize that that's what you were trying to do. Well, I couldn't figure it out. I just have one. I have a very short comment. If you could just name and address of the record, please. 109 Mount Vernon Street, directly across the street from- Thank you so much. My only comment is, anyone who lived in the neighborhood could walk past the house and see the permit posted on the front door, which is still there, dated 6-23 on there, and the adjoining neighbors who were making this filing could have done the same thing I did. Look at the front door. You can see the permit, and you would know without having to go see you or an inspectional services officer. That's it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 69</summary>

> All right. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Paul? Sir? I have one last call for public comment. Mr. Chair? I also can't find the head. This is Carl Tumayan. I'll come back to you in just a second, but there's no other members of the public who wish to address. No? Okay. So, with that, I will close the public comment period. Mr. Tumayan, you had a question.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Toumayan - 85</summary>

> Well, actually, just a comment. One I want to note for the record that the appellants never received a copy of the receipt showing what the building permit fee was that was paid until after the denial, nor did they receive a copy of the building permit that was issued on the 26th. With that said, I would request that the board, when they do make their findings, that they make the finding relative to whether the appellants received or had actual or adequate notice.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 316</summary>

> Okay. Thank you. So, as Mr. Tumayan had said originally, there are two decisions before the board. One is, is the appeal that was received by the board timely, which means within 30 days of the issuance of the building permit? And then the second question, if the board finds that that is not the case, then was adequate notice provided to the appellant in order for them to file timely, in a timely fashion? So, going to the board, I think it's, I think it's, there's been a fair amount of evidence that's provided this evening, also documentation that was submitted to the board that the building permit was issued on June, appears to have been issued on June 23rd and not on July 7th, and that, as the director had said, that July 7th date on the electronic card is, as Mr. Tumayan had noted, has a different font, has a different layout, that that information, that July 7th was the date that that was issued into the electronic system, but that was not the date that the permit was initially issued. The building card that was posted on site is dated June 23rd, and the appellants knew enough that there was construction work going on to, to go to the building department and find and try to get information. They did not check for the building card on the building, which, you know, as the, as the neighborhood said, that would have sort of answered things right then and there. But I would ask the board if they feel that they are comfortable making a finding that the application, that the permit was issued on June 23rd, as is dated on the card, and that the application for the appeal being filed on August 1st would not be timely. I feel comfortable with that decision, making that decision. Other members of the board?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli and Roger Dupont - 37</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Yeah. Mr. Riccardelli. I agree. I agree with you, Mr. Dubond. I feel comfortable with that. The date, the date that is on the picture of the front door seems to solve that for me.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 104</summary>

> Okay. Okay, so I think the board should go on record in regards to this finding. So just to a vote of the board on whether they would approve of the finding that the permit was issued on June 23rd, 2023, and therefore the, the appeal being submitted on August 1st, 2023, is, was not filed in a timely manner. So I will do a quick vote of the board, Mr. Dubond. Mr. Chairman, just as a point of order, and perhaps Mr. Cunningham can weigh in, do we need to have a motion for that vote, or is this just a straightforward vote?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 83</summary>

> There should be a motion, Mr. Chairman. I think you've set it out pretty clearly. And I think for the sake of the record, I think this is the direction you were going, but accept a motion on the issue of whether the appeal was timely, and it sounds like you're going towards a second motion regarding the actual notice. But yes, I would take, I would take two to accept motions, Mr. Chair, and then take votes on those two separate issues.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 126</summary>

> Okay, then in that case, thank you very much, Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Dubond. May I have a motion in regards to the timeliness of the application? So moved, Mr. Chairman, and that would be accepting that the building permit itself was issued on June 23rd, and that's the motion. Okay. So may I have a second? Second. Thank you, Mr. Catelli. So what's before the board is a motion to find that the building permit for 106 Mount Vernon Street was issued by the department, by the Inspectoral Services Division on June 6th, 2023, June 23rd, 2023. And that the application for, so then the appeal of the decision of the building inspector being filed on August 1st was not filed in a timely fashion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 77</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, another point of order, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I, so I think that the motion then is going to have to be two parts. So it's going to be, you know, that we're, we're moving to vote on whether or not the building permit itself was issued on June 23rd. And then that in addition to that, the August 1st appeal that was filed was not timely. So that's the motion that I'm presenting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Michael Cunningham - 104</summary>

> Okay, thank you. I appreciate that clarification. So you're saying, so the motion that's before the board is only that the board would find that the building permit was issued on June 23rd, 2023. And in addition that it was not timely appealed by virtue of the appeal having been filed on August 1st, and Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Cunningham is weighing in. Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Chair, that I believe that would constitute an amended motion where you would need another second on that. Can I just second it again, or do I have to have someone else to it? Nope, that's fine. Okay, second.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 210</summary>

> All right. I'm, I'm going to write this out so we've got this. All right. The board finds that building permit for 106 Mount Vernon Street was issued on June 23rd, 2023, and the application, or sorry, it's not application to appeal of the decision to issue the permit on August 1st, 2023, is not timely. Okay, so the motion will then, Mr. Dupont I would just ask you to confirm, so the motion is the board finds that the building permit for 106 Mount Vernon Street was issued on June 23rd, 2023, and the appeal of the decision to issue the permit on August 1st, 2023 was not time. That is your motion. Correct. Thank you very much. And that was seconded by Mr. Cadelli. Okay, then, a vote of the board on that motion, Mr. Dupont. Mr. Riccadeli. Aye. Ms. Hoffman. Aye. Mr. Hawley. Aye. And Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. And the chair votes aye. So that is the finding of the board on the first question, which moves us to the second question, question of adequate notice. Is there further discussion from the board on the question of whether the notice provided the appellant was time, was, excuse me, not timely, but was sufficiently made available? Mr. Dupont.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 532</summary>

> So, the way I look at this, I mean, there was the request in by email to inspectional services by the appellants on June 21st. Let us know when the permit's issued. We're aware that the permit date determines the period for filing an appeal. So as of that very date, they had complete knowledge that they had to be diligent in terms of keeping an eye on whether or not the permit was issued. And when Mr. Gildart, the following day, June 22nd, replied, it has not yet been issued. Mr. Tumayan contends that that somehow created an affirmative obligation on the part of the town to provide updates. And I do not accept that. I just think that the town offices are too busy to be accepting that sort of. of responsibility. I think that the parties who have a vested interest in this, namely the appellants, are the ones who have to exercise due diligence. So with that said, they knew that the issuance date was critical. They knew on the 21st to ask if it was issued. They knew that work was allowed on June 28th. They didn't, on that date, ask if the building permit had been issued, and had they, they would have been told it had. They didn't ask, apparently, to look at the file on June 28th either, because if they had, I think that would have been in Mr. Tumayan's pleadings. On June 29th, when they went back and they spoke to Mr. Ciampa, they didn't then ask whether the building permit had been issued, nor did they ask whether they could look at the file. So, you know, I believe that they had ample opportunity to protect their own rights by just asking the simple question, has the building permit been issued, to the people who would have the answer. And I'm confident that if it had been asked, they would have been told yes. They apparently didn't look at the building card either, which was at least on the building as of June 28th, the date that they observed the excavation work being done. So I believe that all of this other discussion about July 7th and the uploading and all of that is irrelevant. That's just a function of the way that data is transferred onto the system. The real issue, from my perspective, is what did they know, or what should they have known? And they certainly knew that the work was being done, and they went to Inspectional Services, and they just failed to ask the right question. But that's not on anyone else but them. That's a matter of due diligence. So I think that, you know, the issues too about when they received the file are also irrelevant because of the fact that by that time they should have already known that the permit had been issued. Their knowledge of the permit being issued is not, in my view, dependent upon when they received copies, because that information was all there for them to uncover. So for those reasons, I believe that the notice that they received or could have obtained themselves was, in fact, sufficient.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 51</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Dupont. Excuse me, are there questions or comments from the board?  I do not see further questions or comments from the board. With that in mind, then, Mr. Dupont, I would turn to you again for a motion regards to a finding in regards to adequate notice.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 31</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, I move that the board find that the notice provided to or available to the appellants as to the issuance date of the building permit was sufficient and adequate.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 274</summary>

> So move the board find notice provided to appellants regarding date and issuance of the permit was adequate and sufficient. Is that correct? Yes. Thank you. So there's a motion for Mr. Dupont. Do we have a second? Second. Thank you, Mr. LeBlanc. So with that, we have a motion. It has been seconded. The motion before the board is that the board finds the notice provided to the appellants regarding the issuance regarding the date of the issuance of the permit was adequate and sufficient. That was by Mr. Dupont, seconded by Mr. LeBlanc. Are there any questions from the board about what the motion is? None. I will go ahead and do a vote of the board. Mr. Dupont? Aye. Mr. Riccardelli? Aye. Thank you. Ms. Hoffman?  Aye. Mr. Hawley? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. And the chair votes aye as well. So the board has found that the appeal of the issuance of the building permit was not filed in a timely fashion, and the board finds that adequate notice was provided to the appellant in order to have filed on time. So that then brings us to the last remaining question, which is the question of speak further about the merits of this case. And I think it has been expressed by Mr. Cunningham and from Attorney Heim, town council, this is something the board could do if it wants, but is not something that we're obliged to do. And certainly it is something that would not really serve the board to do. Is there any desire among the board to discuss this matter further?  Mr. Chairman? Mr. DuPont?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 38</summary>

> I believe for the reasons that were outlined by Mr. Cunningham, and then also by Mr. Fitzsimmons, that there is no reason for us to discuss the merits of the case. So I would decline to hear those.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elaine Hoffman - 13</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? Yes, Ms. Hoffman? No, I would agree with that as well.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 74</summary>

> Perfect. Thank you. Okay. That being the case, I think the board will find this matter closed and we will move on to the next item on our agenda. Mr. Cunningham, does that sound correct? It does, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all very much. Good night. Thank you so much for appearing. The board has closed the public hearing on one of six. Mount Vernon Street is closed.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Docket #3758 32 Appleton Street (continued)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 384</summary>

> And with that, we will move to the next item to be taken up this evening, which is 32 Appleton Street. And so I would ask Ms. Francis, if she's here. There she is. Yep, I'm here. So wonderful. Good to have you. So this is a continuation of a hearing that we started at our last session. And at that time, Ms. Francis had introduced that she was looking to open a massage business in her place of residence on Appleton Street. And there was a question from the board because this would be considered a home occupation. There are certain categories of home occupation that are allowed. And the question was massage therapy considered to fall within those allowed categories. And so we continued the hearing so that we could discuss this further with the town. We spoke with Director Ciampa about this question as to whether it is a, excuse me, a public service. And it's not public service is not the correct term. Go ahead and bring up the zoning bylaw. Bear with me a second. Home occupation. Occupation. Home occupation. So home occupation. Oh, this is in the definition section. So home occupation, it says shall not include personal service establishment uses. And so there's a question about whether a massage was considered a personal service. So there are massage businesses currently in town that are considered a personal service. These are sort of more general massage services. Ms. Francis presented evidence to the building inspector and to the board that's now on the record that the service she provides is as she has advanced training on the medical side of massage. And it's more medically therapeutic than just sort of a general service. And for that reason, it was considered that it was actually would fall under the category of medical or clinical office, which is a building or portion of a building containing offices or facilities providing medical and clinical psychiatric or related health care services for outpatient. And it was found that that was the category that this fit within. So just briefly ask Ms. Francis, if she could just describe a little bit about what she's planning to what her business would be like on the site, and then we can go forward from there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jenna Francis - 141</summary>

> Um, hello, again, Jenna Francis with hopefully soon to be opened Arlington Heights Massage Therapy. And so I will have a therapeutic practice here in my home, if granted permission, seeing just with just myself working here. So it would be one client at a time. In my home, I see a lot of previously I had a license to practice out of my home in another town. And I have a lot of clients with that are either recovering from or preparing for knee surgeries, back surgeries, pre and post natal, various nerve disorders, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Parkinson's, frozen shoulder. Lately, I've been getting a lot of frozen shoulder clients for some reason. And so that is the nature of my practice. And I think it will be a great benefit to the community where I live if I'm granted permission.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 45</summary>

> Great, thank you. And I believe you had said before, there was a question about parking and you had indicated that there was, you would be seeing one person at a time and that there was space in your driveway for them to be parking.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jenna Francis - 42</summary>

> Correct. We have a two car garage and then space for two more cars tandem right behind that, and then a long driveway. So there's no reason why it should cause any parking issues just with seeing one client at a time.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 850</summary>

> Yeah. Great, thank you very much. Are there questions from the board in regards to this request? Let's remind the board that this is before the board because a special permit is required for a home occupation where people are seen in the home. I see no questions from the board. Where this is a public hearing, I will go ahead and open this for public comment. So if there are members of the public who wish to address this application, you can use the raise hand button in the reactions tab on the Zoom application, or if you're on the phone, you can dial star nine, or you can wave frantically in your window. I do not see anyone wishing to address this application. With that, I'll go ahead and close the public comment for this hearing. So again, this is an application before the board in regards to wanting to start a home occupation in the R1 district. The memorandum that was issued by the director of inspectional services back on August 28th noted the applicant consulted inspectional services regarding operating a home business in an R2 residential district that would allow customers to be served in the home per the town of Arlington zoning bylaw section 543, use regulations for residential districts, home occupation. There's a note that it requires a special permit if home occupation serves customers or pupils on the premises. That is the request. So when the board is considering a special permit, there are the seven questions that the board needs to review, the seven required findings. So the first is whether the requested use is allowed or allowed by special permit in the district, which we have just reviewed that it is. Why the requested use would be essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. This is a service that would be very useful to residents of Arlington who have some limited physical issues that they are looking for treatment that they would be able to find this locally and not have to travel outside the area to find. The requested use will not create undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety. This would be one car, one patient at a time as the as the applicant stated. I would note it was the letter that the board had received was specifically about parking on around the corner on Avon Place where there is both there's the Otteson Middle School at the end of the street and the Arlington Heights Nursery School is located near there. The applicant has indicated there's sufficient parking in her driveway so that anyone who is visiting this service would not need to turn that corner. It would not impair the safety of any of the students who would be attending either of those institutions. The requested use will not overload any public system. No public system would really be impacted. Requested use will not impair the character or integrity of the neighborhood. This is a fairly simple and straightforward request for a one-on-one service so I don't think that that would be a question. The requested use will not be detrimental to the public health or welfare. I think it would just it would be the opposite that it is providing a health service to the neighbors and to the town and the requested use will not cause an excess of use detrimental to the neighborhood and it would not do that either. So those are the findings the board would need to make in its vote. When the board makes a special should the board vote to approve the special permit there are three standard conditions that the board would apply. I'll go ahead and read into the record. The first is that the plans and specifications approved by the board for the special permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the Town of Arlington in connection with this application for zoning relief. There should be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. In this case there is a hand sketch submitted to the board. Ask the board if they feel that we should impose this condition because it really doesn't seem like it's appropriate for this. Then we'll leave it in. Number two, building inspectors hereby notified is to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time he determines violations are present. Building inspector shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw and under the provisions of chapter 40 section 21d of the Massachusetts general laws and institute non-criminal complaints. If necessary the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action also in accordance with section 3.1. And number three the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to this special permit grant. Does the board feel that there are any additional conditions which would be required should this application be approved? I see none. In which case, I will entertain a motion.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Others - 265</summary>

> So the next item we will take up will be the continued hearing for three sevens for five minutes. Right. Mr Chairman. While we have a little bit of time. I just wanted to tell you that years ago, my law firm was involved in the first major trial of a Superfund case. And it occurred in Denver, and in order to, in order to make everybody relaxed. The judge required all of the lawyers at the beginning of every hearing to tell a joke. And this was intended to have beneficial. No, the result of that was we had an infinite number of associates out researching jokes. Because it was the lawyers were so competitive that they had to have feel that they had told the best joke. And if you know lawyers, you know that even the best joke suffers somewhat at the lawyer's hands. So, having come down on the side, other than jokes. I will point out that I've managed to take another two minutes. Mr Chairman. I would just like to offer a comment on the statements that Mr handling this made I noticed that he doesn't seem to suffer from the lawyer mangling of jokes problem himself. I retired. That's retirement does wonders for the human. Yes, it does it that. So yes, I apologize to everyone we.

We don't have anything on the calendar. I don't believe. But the next dates, the dates in November would be the 14th and the 28th. And the dates in December would be the 12th and the 26th. Those will be the remaining meetings through the end of the year. Mr Chairman, are there any 40 bees that are in line that we know of. Not that I'm aware of. One of the safe harbor provisions is if when the board approves a decision, I believe it's a it's a one year moratorium essentially. And so, assuming that the, the town, you know, that these that the decisions are not appealed so currently the decision for 1021 1027 Mass Ave was not appealed the decision for Thorndike place is no longer under appeal, and the decision for 10 Sunnyside Avenue. I don't know if they have, if they're outside of their appeal period or not they still be within the appeal period, but that those having been approved and moving forward that would grant us some, some relief from a new 40 be application being provided. After that it's a question of the town would need to reevaluate, whether it meets the one and a half percent land area, dedicated to affordable housing because at this point we're still very short of the 10% of all residential units.

<details><summary>	 Group Chatter - 1054</summary>

> Mr. Mr Chairman. In light of all of these things happening is, I wonder if there is any reason to reconsider whether approval of the MBTA communities zoning is essential in order for the town to participate in the fossil fuel free project, whether one of the other provisions that that was having to do with reasonable progress might conceivably apply the certainly there is a lot more activity than we would have imagined a year or so ago. I know very little about. Should have. But you're the comment that the church has made raised in my mind the possibility that we may have options that we had not previously thought of. Now, is that under the jurisdiction of the ARB. The know the, well, the MBTA communities is under the ARB adopted a recommendation that will be the main motion in the in town meeting. At that point Tom meeting will do whatever in its wisdom it decides to do. And things can be amended and all kinds of things like that. Further, but that has to do with the adoption of the rezoning to begin with, and it would be like every other kind of rezoning it operates in the same way. The one of the issues that has been raised is that under the statute that authorizes the town to implement a fossil fuel free and be part of a demonstration project and to forbid new. In most cases forbid new fossil fuel combustion in new buildings is a major renovations, you have to meet one or another of a series of housing requirements, one of which would have been the 10% that we are very far away from. And from qualifying for one is actually enacting a big in and in time and by this February, enacting a MBTA communities act. And the third has to do with having making reasonable progress under housing production plan. And, you know, we, we, again, have done a lot of 40 B stuff. During that period of time and it's conceivable to me that it's worth taking another look to see whether that provides an alternative an alternative way to qualify into the statute. I'm not saying that it does it just this conversation suggested that I will, that I should go look at the statute and see. No, no, no, the, the, one of the requirements is one of the potential ways of qualifying is that if you're making reasonable progress under a housing production plan. And the question in my, my mind is whether or not the 40 B's that we have will will qualify into that provision. I don't know. It just means I got to go look at it. And I'm sure that the town itself is looking at it, it's just that I had not really expected all at once at a key time to be looking at so many looking at Thorndike and 1021 mass, and the intense any side, all of which could potentially come to fruition. But I, I'm not saying that that can happen either. It's just a question. Okay. Mr Chairman, could I ask through you Mr handling a question about the statements he just made. I statements is to official term. I just want to ask a question in terms of your understanding Mr handling of the of the pilot project for the fossil fuels. My understanding was it was no more gas hookups, meaning to natural gas lines in the street. Is it your understanding that this is also covers the additional propane tanks in the front yard that feed a furnace in a house on a new new construction. I don't think that I do know that the propane tanks in your backyard fueling a grill don't count. If, if it is actually heating your house, I, I am not sure I believe that that would not be that would not qualify the end of that but I'd have to look carefully at the statute. I should emphasize that one of the things that has happened in the program is that rather than being a pure Berkeley replied style police the hookups, it actually fits into the enforcement mechanisms of the stretch code and the specialized town has also bought in. And so, the procedurally that will, they will work together. And I'm sure that Mr Trump and the state will work all that out to make it work seamlessly. But that is some difference between that and the bylaw that we additionally adopted. I think that Miss that that Talia has a Talia Fox has a memorandum relating to the fossil fuel project that carefully parses out where they're the same and where they're a little different from the bylaw that we already adopted. Thank you, Mr. I just wanted to, it's my ignorance I know that I haven't done my homework here I just just wondered if off the top of your head, you. Yeah, and you were helpful. Thank you. Thank you. Mr Chairman, as Mr Hamlin saying there is that information by Miss Fox is available. It was heard by the select board last Wednesday. And there's a very good summary. On the website for anybody who's interested in what it doesn't doesn't do. Last night the redevelopment board voted on they had 12 articles for the special town meeting. They met last night to debate and approve final language so that will be my understanding is that'll their report will come out on Friday and that will indicate what is in the base. Vote for the MBTA communities sub district that they're, they're working on. It also is worth noting that there's been a commitment that the MBTA communities that it's so complicated I mean they were there were so many options that going back and forth and fairly substantial revisions were made that those will not be heard by town meeting before the 23rd. We'll end up starting with other other articles than that one. And that one at earliest would be the 23rd that doesn't say it will necessarily start on the 23rd. It kind of depends on where you are on everything else but this will be a very interesting and and fairly long town meeting. Yes. Unusual for a fall.

> Three minutes, three minutes we can get going. Okay, Mr. Well another question to take up some time. If you're willing. Um, I must have missed the final meetings related to 10 sunny side. Maybe, maybe the decision is still being written I'm not you said it was in the appeal period so I must have missed the going over of the final decision. Yep, so the final decision. I think it was. Was drafted and approved by the board. The beginning of August. No, no, no. It was in the beginning of it. It was the second meeting in September. 12th, I think, or something like that. I know, I know I missed one of them. It must've been that one that you actually went ahead and did the approval. Okay. We finished that. I think it was the second meeting in September. Which is the operative date. For appeals to be filed. And what I think the chair was suggesting earlier is he wasn't quite sure whether that appeal period. It is still open or not. Thank you. I just wanted to say that the docu sign is up for those. If anybody wants to sign them, either way. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. It is now 915. And with that, we will return to this is at hand I thank everyone for their patience. I apologize for overestimating how much time we would need for earlier items.

<details><summary>Docket # 3761 5 Mystic Lake Drive (continued)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 53</summary>

> So returning to our agenda this. Now, move on to item number seven on our agenda, just dock at 37615 mystically drives continuation of a prior hearing that was begun in August. And I would turn to attorney and se to reintroduce the project and to tell us what has transpired in between.

<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 1221</summary>

> Since we last were here. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am accompanied this evening by on standby by john barrels, who is the PE who handle the conservation matter. And by Mr. Brayton, who is the PE PE who did the traffic study. We went back, as you suggested we should, and did some more homework, and that homework consisted of having a meeting on site with the tree warden, Mr Mahoney did that with the tree warden and Christian if I could ask you if you could pull up the letter from the tree warden that is dated September 20 of 2023. The. We can talk about that. The tree warden did take a look at the site. The tree warden did take a look at the existing trees as well. And the, there was a tree plan that was in fact prepared. We have that as well. You should have that Christian as well. The tree plan was approved by the tree warden, and you should have that tree plan as well. And the, the, the conclusion on the part of the tree warden was that the plan submitted by my client was in fact sufficient, and he approved it. With respect to comments that he made in that letter. He made a comment that the, the, the, the tree plan was in fact consistent with the requirements of the bylaw. And he did say that my client had an obligation on an ongoing basis to in fact ensure that the, the main stem and critical root zone of the trees. Now, toward that end, we have engaged the services of a And a tree expert, I should say, and the tree expert basically has come up with a, a proposal for us in terms of what we are going to be doing to preserve trees. And that is the report of the accredited tree care company, Barrett, and they're certified tree experts. And basically, we have an ongoing arrangement with him with them with respect to what's going to be done as far as tree preservation is concerned. I know there was a lot of discussion last time about whether in fact any tree roots were going to be damaged by the driveway that we were going to be installing and by other issues, construction issues as well. The bottom line on the part of the tree warden is that's not going to happen. And as a method to ensure that that is not going to happen, there'll be a shifting of obligation to my client to continue with that tree expert company to preserve the, the viability of the trees. Now, that was one of the issues that was discussed. There was also a discussion about the driveway. And I know there was a lot of discussion about the length of the driveway, and whether in fact you would have two full size cars, basically overhanging onto the sidewalk with respect to the driveway that we were initially proposing. Well, my client went back to David Morgan of the Conservation Commission and spoke to David Morgan about that issue. And David indicated to him that he had discretion, to a certain extent, with respect to the Conservation Commission rules and regulations to give us another two feet with regard to the length of the driveway. What we did is, we also basically came up with a calculations, essentially, with regard to how folks would be gauging the length of a car. And a full size car. And that is on that all along as a car calculation, Christian that you have a full size car is 15.7 feet. And we will have ample rooms to have two full size cars in that driveway, with respect to parking with no overhang onto the sidewalk. So that's the second issue that we were asked to deal with the third issue that we were asked to deal with was the issue relating to the traffic. The location of the second driveway, and essentially, the makeup of the street. Now, if you had occasion to get down there and take a look at the street, you would have seen that it's a pretty quiet street. And the traffic study, bears that out. We did a traffic study and if you could bring that up, Christian on your screen as well. That's the traffic study of data September 20 of 2023 by That's the traffic study of Brian and Associates dated September 25 of 2023. That traffic study indicates that the proposed second driveway is located on the north side of Mystic Lake Drive, approximately 55 feet from Mystic Valley Parkway. There is an existing driveway for six Mystic Lake Drive, almost directly across from the proposed driveway. Mystic Lake Drive is a two way, two lane roadway in a residential neighborhood. The traffic counts were taken on Mystic Lake Drive in the vicinity of the proposed driveway over a 24 hour period on September 14 of 2023. There were 84 vehicles during the 24 hour period, with 42 vehicles traveling in both the eastbound and the westbound directions. Due to the distance of the driveway from Mystic Valley Parkway, it is anticipated that the vehicles are driving at a low rate of speed when they come off of Mystic Valley Parkway. Because quite frankly, they do not have the ability to conjure up any speed because of that short distance. Based on a review of the proposed driveway, the low traffic volumes and low anticipated vehicle speeds on Mystic Lake Drive, there do not appear to be any safety concerns with the location of the proposed driveway. Now that's the conclusion of Bryan Associates, Todd E. Brayton. Now, there was a further issue that I think Christian had brought up. And Christian brought up a question with regard to whether we might need bollards with regard to that mechanical piece of equipment that is located in the roadway. We are certainly willing to do that, if in fact that is something that the board wants us to do. And we're open to that in terms of what those bollards might consist of as well. The one thing I want to emphasize this evening is that we're not talking conservation, okay? We've had a conservation hearing. The conservation hearing issued an order of conditions. The order of conditions was recorded at the Registry of Deeds. That's history. That's been done. I brought in Mr. Barrows anyway on standby, just in case anyone from the board had any questions about that. But I don't believe that we should be getting into conservation issues as far as the hearing is concerned. I think we have, and by the way, this has been beaten into the ground, okay? Yes, it's in an R2 zone. Yes, it was a single-family house. I will say that again. I'm the one who brought that out initially, okay? I brought that out, not anyone else, okay? And quite frankly, it's been beaten into the ground. If it's brought up again, that is certainly overkill, okay? That's not an issue before the board, and it shouldn't be an issue before the board. With that having been said, Bill Mahoney, would you like to jump in and make some comments?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Bill Mahoney - 166</summary>

> Yeah, hello. Thank you for taking the time, folks. I just wanted to give some of the neighbors really an idea of who I am. I've been living in this town for more than 50 years. I've got three children in the Arlington Public Schools, and there seems to be concerns here about permits being properly pulled. And more recently, there's been two permits pulled, and it seems they're trying to make it out as though I'm not pulling permits. And certainly moving forward, everything's going to be done by the book. And again, I regret not having more contact with the neighbors initially. It's my first time doing the Conservation Commission thing, and I had no idea I would have to do this when I bought the property. But here I am. Certainly moving forward, I have no issues contacting the neighbors and having regular conversations with them as far as the construction and the entire process. That's all I want to say. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 151</summary>

> I'd like to say one more thing. And again, I've said this before. This is an R2 zone, okay? No one living in the R2 zone should be surprised that my client wants to construct a two-family house in the R2 zone. The difference is that he's looking for two driveways, okay? That's the issue before the board, okay? He's looking for two driveways. Now, there's a new home going up, a two-family home going up at the other end of Mystic Lake Drive, okay, as well, on the street. I'm beginning to understand, by the way, that there has been a lot of controversy about that in terms of folks in the neighborhood complaining about that as well. Again, it's a two-family zone. This is what two-family zones are designed for. This is what town meeting decided when they said we want this to be a two-family zone. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 107</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Nessie. I'm just going to quickly put the plan back up. Oh, by the way, I didn't mention one more. We also went ahead and did a revised site plan showing the plantings with respect to the buffers on either side of the lot. I'm sorry. Thank you. I know that last time there was specific concern about the driveway, and I believe it was the tree I'm circling here, and the proximity. And just to confirm with you, you have moved this driveway and changed its angle in order to increase the distance between the curb cut and the tree. Is that correct?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Bill Mahoney - 33</summary>

> I get this, Bob. Yes, I met Christian with the tree warden out there myself, and he's the one who came up with that measurement, and that's why we did that, of course.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 46</summary>

> Yes. Okay. And then also this does show the screening planting that's required for parking that would occur in a side yard, and it occurs on both sides. And I'm sorry, Mr. Nessie, can you just repeat again in regards to protection of the electric box?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 34</summary>

> Yes, we are open to bollards being placed to protect that electrical box. And what form the board would want us to take to make that happen, we are open to that as well.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Robert Annese - 493</summary>

> Great, thank you. I'll go ahead and stop sharing this. So I had a conversation earlier today with David Morgan, who's the town's conservation agent. So the other question that had to come up is that in the zoning bylaws, section 5.7, which is the floodplain district, and the floodplain district imposes a variety of restrictions on development that can happen for projects that are proposed within that district. And the applicability of it is that any proposed use, structure, development, filling, grading, or excavation within the floodplain district shall be governed by all regulations of the section. And it says that the extent of the floodplain district shall be determined by the Conservation Commission. So I had asked him specifically about that as to whether or not this property fell within what would be considered the floodplain district. And he and I reviewed the firm maps that are produced by FEMA, and he had noted that the applicants had submitted a letter, which had been accepted by the Conservation Commission and by FEMA, that indicated a change, a requested change in the firm, which would still have a portion of the property within the floodplain district, but the portion of the property where the house stands would be outside of the floodplain because it is higher than the flood elevation. So I just present as additional background to the board that in the determination based on that letter that was submitted and accepted by the Conservation Commission, The, the location on the property where the house is proposed is outside of the floodplain district. There has been some conversation as to whether if any part of the property is within the floodplain district. If the restriction applies to the entire parcel or not. It's a conversation, we can have in reading the section of the code. I don't see somewhere where it specifically speaks in that fashion. It talks more about areas, but I, it's something that that the board can discuss as a part of its deliberations. I would also note that the board is in receipt of several letters from a resident in the neighborhood. And those are all on the Zoning Board of Appeals website for this hearing. So with that, I would, are there questions from the board for the applicant? Seeing none. With that, I will go ahead and move to the next, next phase on this which would be public comment period. So public comment is taken as it relates to the matter at hand and is to be addressed by the board for the purpose of helping us inform our decision. As many people have already found, you can use the raise hand button on the reactions tab and zoom, or if you're calling in you can dial star nine but I don't see anybody having been calling in at the moment. So with that, the first person in the queue is Ms. Joanne Preston.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joanne Preston and Christian Klein - 991</summary>

> Can you hear me? We can, yes. Joanne Preston, 42 Mystic Lake Drive, which is, by the way, Mystic Lake Drive is only two blocks long. We have two construction sites. I'd like to first comment on the protection of the trees and that there's going to be someone hired to overlook everything for some period of time. This is a developer. I'm sure as soon as the units are finished, they will be sold. So any protection will expire when they're sold. Additionally, there was a comment on, you know, it's a two family, you can do a two family, you still have to obey the law. And one of the reasons that the neighbors have been so concerned about the trees is the first thing the developer did was to pull a large truck on the, on the property and knock off a large limb of the state trees. No one has looked into what will happen to the street state trees. So, I also had a few questions of the developers lawyer, can I ask him directly. You can ask me and I can forward your question. Okay. He begins his letter to you, referencing a September 22 survey. I didn't find a survey. I found a site plan. Mr. It's not a survey it's a site plan. Okay. I've had a very hard time. And even with a magnifying glass. Seeing some of the numbers. One thing that the arborist didn't do is he didn't calculate the amount of space, at least on what you submitted. Maybe you did elsewhere. How much. How much of tree number two, for instance, would be from the driveway. I think it's there in small numbers, but I think it's 12 point something. Go ahead and open that up again. There's a whole way of calculating it which the tree warms me. It's the DBH time. Okay. So the DBH is one inch of the DBH. Needs to have 10 inches of root divided by two. And then you have so on. So. Is it. It's 12.5. Okay. Okay. That was added to the driveways. How long the driveway is. To that. How long is the driveway. I mean, looking at this stuff. So I'm assuming that this dash line is for the proposed parking space of 20 feet long. Yeah. It's only 33 feet to the, to the sidewalk Christian. 33 Feet. Okay. Yeah. Just under that. Is what we have here. Again, I don't know. At the end of the day. Maybe an inch or two shorter or longer by an inch. That adds the two feet on right. Correct. Okay. Well, My reading of. The parking and loading spaces standards. That that is still in violation of the bylaw. Because the bylaw. I'll read you the relevant part. Says. Except. That some spaces, which are open and unobstructed at one end. Maybe only 15 feet in length. Her car. Okay. That goes for the other driveway too. I could read the whole. Citation if you like. But. This isn't six one 11. Six. Yeah. One 11. Okay. So technically a parking space is eight and a half. By 18. And. So that was 36. Right. But for the, by the zoning bylaw, we're only allowed to require a single parking space per unit. Okay. So. Some of them have. Provide that dimension. This one is 20 and this one is also. 20 Feet. So there's two feet. Then there's an additional space beyond that. This cannot be considered a parking space. We had asked specifically that they elongate the driveway. Because. Because it's not technically a parking space. We can't. It would. They do have one parking space, which they're required by code and it is of the size that is required to be. So if there were two cars there, they're most likely we'll overhang. Sidewalk. Well, the. The information provided by the app. Is that. Because the average they provided documentation about the average length of a car and the. Parking space is long. The total driveway length is longer than twice. That dimension. So they feel. That it would be appropriate. But if the car was to be. You know, Interfering with the, with the sidewalk. That's a matter for the police department. Okay. So. That's for tandem parking. No, we had just specifically requested that they try to elongate the driveways in anticipation that. We would want to avoid. Having a car overhang as best as possible. So the only thing that town requires. It's 18 feet for one car. That's correct. And it has to be beyond the front yard setback. And the rest of the driveway is what. It's 20 feet beyond that. So the 20 feet. Meets the requirement. Of the 18 feet. Right. Correct. So the parking, it does provide parking. That is compliant with the zoning bylaw. With the exception that it needs a special permit in order to have a second driveway. Yes. And what are the conditions for a second driveway? So. The board needs to make three findings in regards to a second driveway. The second driveway. We would have to be added in a manner that avoids an undue concentration of population. That a second driveway can be added in a manner that allows adequate provision of transportation. And that the second driveway may be added in a manner that conserves the value. You have the lane. And the buildings in the vicinity. So there's nothing about safety. Not specifically accept that because it's a special permit. The third. Well, I still maintain. That. It does because. You can't. You have to move this map. When people turn. Right. Off of mystic Valley parkway. Which is a very popular cut through. They have to make a very sharp turn. And now that the driveway has been moved in particular. I think that's. Creates a danger.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Cindy - 91</summary>

> Okay. I'm going to go back to Cindy. And we'll go back to Cindy. Welcome. Thank you. They have to make a very sharp turn. And now that the driveway has been moved in particular. I think that's creates a danger. The fact that there's a driveway on the other side, the traffic is going in the other direction, so that you can see it has good sight lines all the way down. And that makes that driveway, not as dangerous. But we should, we should hear from some other people.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 13</summary>

> Okay. Thank you very much. Back. Next on our list is Mr Moore.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 136</summary>

> Oh yes, thank you, Mr. Steve Moore Piedmont street. Thank you. I find myself in the unusual position of. Disagreeing a little bit with Ms. Preston. I wanted to. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what. Proactive activities they've done relative to the trees. The tree protections of the root zones, working with the tree warden and getting a real tree plan. All things that are required by the process, of course, but. It showed some really trying to work with the situation, including the maintaining of a. A tree company. To be sure the trees are adequately protected. I think it sounds like there's been some, some very significant work done here and I'm pleased to see it. And I'm glad the tree warden is in agreement that this is a good plan. Thank you.

> Thank you, Mr. Moore. Next on my list is Brian McLaughlin. Good evening. We are just name and address of the record, please. Brian McLaughlin, 15 mystically drive unit two next door. Thank you. And I wanted to second, Mr. Morris comment about the diligence and effort. That's clearly been put in, not only by the town and the tree warden. But, you know, Mr. Mahoney for. Respecting those rules and recommendations and keeping these, these natural assets in place. And arguably. Value improvement for the home as well. So. I see on the map. The site plan. That the assessed. Property boundary overlaps into our fence. A bit. On the yeah, right over there. So I just want to confirm. I don't know if that's going to be left undisturbed. Take back that fence and demolish it or anything, or if that's going to be left undisturbed. Sort of a gentleman's agreement there. Any comment from. Yeah. I'm open to discuss that with you. You wanted to leave it. I wouldn't be opposed to that, or I'll put up a new one. We can discuss that. Certainly. Like I said, I would be open to any suggestions you might have. I would be open to any comments. I can send you a number and email. That's part of the process as well. Moving forward, I have to send out a letter to the abutters and certainly you got it. You have one of them. And yeah, so I would absolutely. Be open to any suggestions. I did notice that as well. It's very, it's very close, but yeah, I saw that. That fence is probably on its way out. If you, I don't know if you agree with that or not. Yeah. You know, actually you make that comment. It's not clear to me what fence that is. That may be just that ticket fence that is on your side of the property. I'd be happy to take this offline. Mr. If you. You wouldn't mind leaving a note, maybe in our mailbox with contact information for you. Yeah. I live right up the road. So yeah, that's no problem. Okay. Thank you.

> Thank you. Next. Next. I think this is Dave de Lorenzo. And Charlie McConnell were neighbors directly across the street at 10 mystically drive. And we too would like to commend Mr. Mahoney for. The work that he's done on the traffic study process. The project is. Has. Certainly adjusted around some community concerns so far, and that's appreciated. I just want to speak. Narrowly. To the. On the subject of the traffic study that was done. I don't have the expertise to. Have an opinion about whether 60 feet is adequate or 40 feet is better or anything like that. But to the extent that it was determined by. An outside independent evaluator that. The street is a low traffic street. I just want to take issue with that because. I don't think that it's a good idea to put cones out. In a way that two and six year olds will be. You know, I, I put cones out. There's no other way than to put cones out. It's often a quiet street. It's sometimes a very. It's sometimes a pass through street. It's not always a quiet street. It's not always a quiet street. It's not always a quiet street. It's not always a quiet street. When that happens. It's not every day. It tends to coincide with rainier days and it wasn't a rainy day when the traffic study was done, but it all often can happen on non rainy days too. When it happens and traffic backs up. Then Google maps or ways. We'll tell. You know, we'll tell people that if they have been sitting in their car, moving slowly. And falling behind in their plans. They will make a fast right turn. And aggressively. Drive on the street. If as part of this process that were within it, within anyone's. Ability to designate this as a. As a residence only street or a street that was, you know, that had a sign saying. You know, I'm not going to drive on the street. That would be appreciated. And that would certainly address some of these concerns, but. To the extent that this issue is. The. The issue of. Traffic. Safety on the street is, is. Part of what will help determine the placement of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the. Of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the, of the. Just. Aren't consistent with what we observe on a, on a daily basis. And. That's all for now.

> Christian. Briefly on that. I was just going to briefly mentioned to. Lorenzo. That you should. For concerns about the traffic. And, you know, those are the town boards that are in a position to do something about that. And they deal with all the. and traffic signs and everything like that. They're very good to work with. I would highly encourage you to talk to the select board and the transportation advisory committee because that's absolutely something they should be paying attention to. Okay, we'll do that. Mr. Mahoney. I'll be supportive of that too, you guys. And if there's anything I can do to assist, I certainly would be willing to do that. That's a great idea. Mr. Nesse, did you have something as well? No. No, okay, thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 103</summary>

> Great, thank you all very much. Are there other members of the public who wish to address this hearing? Seeing none, I'm gonna go ahead and close the public hearing. I do note that Mr. DiLorenzo and Ms. O'Connell have submitted letters to the board that are on the website. And Ms. Preston has also in conjunction with Barbara Hindley, Serena Bray, Paul Kelly and Maureen Kelly have issued a letter that is in the record as well. Mr. Chair, I believe Mr. McLaughlin has raised his, did raise his hand pretty closely. Thank you, Mr. Moore, for bringing that attention. Mr. McLaughlin.

> I snuck in for a second time, yeah. I snuck in for a second there, apologies. Adding on to Dave's comments, you know, we have a new five-year-old neighbor downstairs and are happy parents of a newborn and unrelated to this property in particular, but if there's any venue or way to request a bright yellow, you know, children's zone or some sort of cautionary sign to folks as they whip around that corner on Mystic Valley Parkway, that might be something towards that direction of helping to maintain some amount of alertness and safety on that street. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 304</summary>

> Yeah, unfortunately the streets are outside of our jurisdiction, but it does sound like there is a sizable community concern and having some kind of a joint letter to the select board and the transportation advisory committee. Hopefully we get the ball rolling on doing something because it certainly sounds like it's something that is on everyone's mind in this neighborhood and should definitely be taken care of. So with that, I will close the public comment period on this hearing and come back to the board. So the decision that is in front of the board, the application, it's for the second driveway. Everything else has been vetted through the conservation commission and the letter from the special services department notes that the property, the existing building is a single family dwelling located in an R2 zoning district. The applicant consulted in special services regarding adding a second driveway and per the Arlington zoning bylaw, section 6110, location of parking spaces, subsection A, parking and residential districts for single family, two family duplex, three family dwellings in the R1, R2, R3, R4 districts, not more than one driveway shall be permitted unless there's a finding by the special permit granting authority for the development that a second driveway or a driveway that makes more than one intersection with the street may be added in a manner which avoids an undue concentration of population, allows adequate provisions of transportation and conserves the value of land and buildings in the vicinity. So those are the findings that the board would be required to make and to assisted that the board would also apply the seven standard conditions, not conditions, excuse me, the seven standard findings required for a special permit. So turning back to the board, are there additional questions or comments from the board?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 52</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. Mr. Hanlon. I guess there are, the chair mentioned earlier the existence of a separate set of rules regarding to the wetlands protection zone in the bylaw for protection zone. And I'm wondering where, if anywhere, that that fits within the decision that we're being asked to make.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 224</summary>

> It sort of is an unusual situation here in that ISD does not, as far as I know, have an opinion at this point as to whether or not there is a violation of any of the provisions of that section of the code. And I'm a little bit unclear about the way in which that, whether that is actually even in before us at all. And if it is what we need to make of it in order to apply the rules that are clearly in front of us that the chair just read. So I did have a conversation with Director Ciampa in regards to 5.7. Let's see, because I believe, I think I have an email from him. Just can't remember if it was over email or if it's something we talked about on the phone. Hold on, just checking. I believe it was over the phone. So he had spoken with David Morgan, the conservation agent of the town. And the question has sort of gone back and forth a little bit, but the understanding that I had from speaking with Director Ciampa was that he did not feel that because the area of the building was outside of the floodplain and in a manner that was approved by the conservation commission, that 5.7 was not applicable to the building.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 411</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, I wonder whether we could just, what we've been asked to do is approve the two entrances onto the street. I think it is difficult for us to have an independent position with respect to this as compared to ISD and the conservation commission. And it doesn't seem to me true that if we were to approve the two entrances onto the street, that that would necessarily imply any judgment on our part about whether 5.7 applies. That would still be something that is up to Mr. Ciampa if he were to decide that it did, contrary to what he has just told you, that it did apply and that it created a problem here, then that would set up a new proceeding that we could then address the issue when it's properly presented to us. So it seems to me that we should just sort of say whatever we do doesn't have any effect on that question. We're not making a decision one way or the other and haven't been asked to make a decision one way or the other on whether 5.7 applies or whether if it did apply, whether it would preclude what the applicant is proposing here, in which case we have a fairly simple set of three main criteria, three findings that we have to make. It seems to me that of those three, that there's no serious contention that this would be an undue concentration of population. It probably, we have not heard anything very persuasive about conserving the value of land and buildings in the vicinity. So that really kind of puts us right up against the adequate provision of transportation as the major area that we have to make a finding on. And the second driveway, and also it's the question of whether it conserves the value of land and buildings, whether it has any impact on adjoining properties. The adjoining property is not on one side, that's with the existing driveway. That's the existing driveway. So it's not a question of conserving the value of land and buildings, that's the existing, basically that driveway is being relocated within the site, but the new driveway is the one that is closer to Mystic Valley Parkway, which abuts land that I'm not entirely sure who the owner is, whether it's the state or the town for that parkland that abuts the parkway. I believe that's the state, but I'm not certain, Christian.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 308</summary>

> Okay, thank you. Okay, so the board in order to determine if the board should move forward with an approval, we need to review the findings that the board would need to make. So this is under section 6.1.10A, the location of parking spaces. So the second driveway may be added in a manner that avoids an undue concentration of population. So this is a two-family or proposed two-family dwelling in a two-family district. It was originally developed as a single-family home. It is now being redeveloped as a two-family home, which meets the zoning requirements. So I would recommend that the board find that it does not create an undue concentration of population. Second driveway may be added in a manner that allows adequate provision of transportation. I would take that to mean that it does not interfere with the flow of traffic in the street and provides adequate space for personal transportation for the owners of the home. And as Mr. Hammond noted, that's sort of the question here is, does the adding a second driveway, does it create an issue for traffic safety on Mystic Valley Drive, excuse me, Mystic Lake Drive. And the third, whether the second driveway can be added in a manner that conserves the value of land and buildings in the vicinity. I think the addition of the driveway with the plantings involved in the screening and the screening that's on both sides, that that will not be a detriment to the remainder of the neighborhood. And then we did note that they are required to provide landscaping and setback in the side yard between the edge of the property and the driveway. And they are showing that on their plans and they do have an approved plan from the tree warden. Does anyone have any question about those three findings?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 321</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? Seeing none. Yes, sir, Mr. Hammond. So I'm sorry, I need to go back online on vision. So I've been struck by the conversation that took place during the last several minutes of the public thing. Obviously, I mean, when I went up to look at this neighborhood, I believe actually I was there on a day when Mr. DiLorenzo had to move the cones in the street. Clearly it is a kind of street where people play and clearly on the day I was there, there was no other car in sight. And I sort of stayed and waited to see whether there would be more people and there weren't. And I think that when Mr., I think it was Mr. DiLorenzo characterized this as a street that's a quiet street, except when it isn't is where the problem is. And I think that's a problem that Mr. Mahoney indicates he shares and would like to solve for the basis of the people who he's preparing new houses for. And I'm sort of persuaded that if everybody could get together, that there are a lot of traffic calming measures that could address the situation that exists. And that would have a great deal more impact than the problem of which, of how many driveways there are, which I think would be fairly marginal in terms of the real problem that exists. And I'm actually encouraged that with all of the discussion that's taken place and I know that there have been difficult feelings about these sorts of things, that the discussion we ended with was a constructive one that was aimed at improving the entire neighborhood. And I'd like both to commend people for doing that, but also I think that Mr. Mahoney and his, ultimately his people he sells to will be useful additions to the neighborhood and that they will help to get these problems solved.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 441</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. The other findings that the board would be required to make are the standard seven findings for a special permit, that the requested use is allowed or allowed by special permit in the district. This is a special permit under 6110A. So it is allowable by special permit. Requested use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. So off street parking, the town still does not allow on street parking, having off street parking that is not shared with another, with a different homeowner certainly is helpful. The, if they were not able to add the second driveway, they would need to add parking along existing parking. So it'd be much more parking directly against the abutting neighbor at 15 Mystic Lake Drive. So I think it's desirable to avoid that condition that it would not create undue traffic ingestion or impair pedestrian safety. I think that adding a second driveway does create another opportunity where there are cars crossing the public sidewalk. I think that the proper placement of the plantings, because you're not allowed to have anything taller than 30 inches within five feet of the property line. So I think having shorter plantings adjacent to the sidewalk to make sure that the sight lines are not impaired, be helpful not only for pedestrians, but also for seeing traffic that may be moving onto the street. Will not overload any public system. Public systems would not be affected. And this does not add any water to the street because it's a pervious driveway. Would not impair the character or integrity of the neighborhood that while it has been noted in some of the correspondence that a property having two driveways are not common in this neighborhood, the length of the property line on Mystic Lake Drive does make it so that the distance between the driveways being over 60 feet does appear to be sufficient to maintain the character of the neighborhood. Would not be detrimental to public health or welfare. It is just a driveway. And with the proper screening and the proper sight lines, it will maintain public safety and will not cause an undue, to cause an excess of use detrimental to the neighborhood. It is a two-family in a two-family zone. And driveways are, there are driveways in the zone and this driveway can be added without, in a way that doesn't impair the land. And so I think it would not be detrimental to the neighborhood. That's the way I would address those findings. Are there any questions from the board in regards to the seven findings?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 129</summary>

> Mr. Chair. None? Yes, sir. I just, just a comment if it's okay. So I know we've reviewed similar cases to this in our two neighborhoods about adding a secondary driveway. And I think it's always come down for these seven conditions, the special permit conditions to the safety and the character. And oftentimes in those conditions, it's because they're mid-block plots and the second driveway would essentially remove all the green space along the street. I think in this case, because of the unique size of the lot and kind of the big buffering that happens along the Sioux Valley Parkway at the corner, that this is as good an application as any to add a second driveway. So I would be in favor of that. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 133</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. Just as a quick addition to that, we might want to pass on to the ARB that when we discuss what we actually do when we apply these conditions, it is only with some degree of poetic license that we actually squeeze our real considerations into the language. So Mr. Riccardelli is quite right. We are very often dealing with trees and green space and so on. And so when we have a bi-law that nowhere appears in the criteria, the findings that we're supposed to make, we sort of import them by talking about the value of buildings and things like that. But it would be better to have a bi-law that actually focuses in on what the real considerations are and directs us to the real considerations.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Patrick Hanlon - 104</summary>

> So I think that's a good point. Thank you. I think it's important. It's important for us to make the findings that are appropriate, given those. Those rather than have generic things that we have to. Interpret to make them actionable criteria. So it's something we've had problems with this. Provision for quite. For a long time. And it, it isn't, it hasn't gotten fixed, but. It's, it's, it's, it's. It's always more comfortable. Where the decisions that we're being asked to make are the actual decisions that matter for. Both for the public and for the people in the neighborhood. Well, thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 381</summary>

> Thank you. So when we had originally taken this up on August 29th. I had made a couple of com notes about. The tree warden. So the board would, should the board be voting to approve? We have the three standard conditions that we've already read into the record this evening. So we would have those. There was also a note here that the board requests the applicant to work with the tree warden. That has already happened. So I don't think we need to include that as a condition. Okay. There was a proposed condition that the board has neither discussed or taken a position on section 5.7 floodplain district in the zoning bylaw. Which I think we would amend. To say the board has not taken a position on section 5.7. And then there was a proposed. Condition about the applicant is to comply with applicable local and state. Bylaws and regulations regarding public street trees. I think that their conversation with the tree warden. Has already addressed that concern. The applicant is to provide a bollard to protect the electrical service box from the driveway. I think that is still. A reasonable condition. Okay. The driveways are to be. 18 Feet in length from the edge of the sidewalk to the provided parking spaces. This was discussed by the applicant that they. They were able to extend the driveways by two feet, but we're not able to extend them further. And requiring that they extend them further would most likely require that the. The. The standard size of a car is 15.7 feet. So. You know, 31.4 would be the. The length and the driveways are 33 feet. So. Unless there is a strong desire to include this, I was going to go ahead and recommend that we not pursue that as a condition. Okay. So as I have it here, we have the three standard conditions with. Two additional. One being that the board has taken, has not taken a position on section 5.7 floodplain district and the zoning bylaw. And that the applicant is to provide a bollard to protect the electrical service box from the driveway. Okay. Being none. Unless there's any other questions from the board, I would entertain a motion on this application.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 35</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Second. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. So this is a vote of the board to approve a special permit for five minutes to click drive with the. Three standard conditions and two additional conditions. Special permit to. Second driveway. Mr. Hanlon. Hi. Mr. Holly. Hi. Mr. Rickardelli. Mr. Chair, am I eligible to vote on this? I was not. Previously. We were not. That's right. Thank you for reminding me. Mr. LeBlanc is a similar condition. Ms. Hoffman. Aye. And the chair votes. So that.

> Okay. I just had one question with respect to the bollards. Do you, I mean, do you need one on each side of that box? We'll just be in the driveway side.

> Okay. So with that, we move on to. The next item on our agenda, which is docket three, seven, six, seven 77. Again, this was with Mr. So if you could introduce us to this project.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 897</summary>

> Yes. This is a. Situation where we are looking for relief under section. 5.3 0.9. Okay. Now I hopefully haven't bored you. Christian by sending you photographs. Okay. But the client thought it would be important for you. To have the photographs. To show what the. The porch area. Would have looked like. Late 1950s, early 1960s. So we're going to be using the concrete platform. That was there then. Now my client has talked to Mike Champa. And asked Mike Champa. Because I posed the question with him. And I said. I want an answer. On. On your, your building. It's a two. You're using it as a two. And. What does my Champa say about that? And my champion indicated to my client. That the building was built. As a two family. In the year 19. Oh, eight. And so. That basically was the response. We got from this Champa. Now you've got a plan. And you've got a plan. Scott Lynch of Rover survey. That basically shows you. The dimensions of the proposed addition. And that's the proposed plot plan. Of 77 Tanager road. And you have that Christian. I don't want to pull that up or not. Yeah, there we go. You have the dimensions. Of the. Of the proposed addition. You also have. Two sketches. Which were submitted by. Myself in behalf of the applicant with respect to. The dimensions. Of the proposed edition. What we are proposing is. The first portion. Of the proposed addition. Would be. 3.3 0.9. But rather. Under the second portion. The language being. Enclosed entrances. Larger than that allowed. And larger than that allowed me meeting. Having gone through. The first portion, which reads. The second portion. Would not extend more than. 25 Square feet in floor area. Or more than one story high. Would you do not project more than three and a half feet. Beyond the line of the foundation wall. May extend beyond the minimum yard regulations. Otherwise provided. Or in the district. In which the structure is built. Well, we. In my opinion. Would go to. The second portion. The language in section 5.3 0.9. And so we're looking to do. And enclosed. Porch area. The reason for the enclosed porch area is. That the client would like to have. Some protection. For the interior of the building. And. Right now there, there would be no protection. From the winter elements because. When you open the door to the interior of the building. You're going to have snow coming in and, and the like. Whereas if you have this enclosed area. The enclosed area would serve as a buffer. To the interior of the building. And so. In order to grant a special permit. In connection with. Section 5.3 0.9. We believe that we have satisfied. The. The. Special permit criteria. The property. Is. Defined in the bylaw as being a special permit. And so. As I've indicated. Explain why the requested use. Is essential or desirable. To the public convenience or welfare. Well, it's desirable. Or convenient to the public. Convenience or welfare. Certainly. For the public convenience. So, as I've said. In terms of the buffer area. The. Why the use will not create undue traffic congestion. Or undo unduly impair. Pedestrian safety. There will be no increase in traffic congestion. Because the building will be used exactly the way it's been used. Historically. And there will be no change. In the occupancy of the building. Any regulations for the use. As may be provided for in the zoning bylaw. Included, but not limited. To the provisions of section eight of fulfilled. And the indication that I have indicated there is they are fulfilled. Explain why. The proposed addition. Is in keeping with the character of the district or adjoining districts. It would be detrimental to the health of welfare. I, my argument there is. The proposed addition. It's in keeping. With the physical characteristics of other homes. In, in, in the neighborhood. We're not introducing. An aberration. That already exists. In the neighborhood. With regard to the. Why the addition. Will not basically cause an excess of that. Use. I think that's easily answered. It's not going to cause an excess of that use. If people want to have that kind of a. A porch area. It's not the kind of a use. That I think. That provision in the bylaw is contemplating. Okay. I think that provision of the bylaw. Is contemplating a different kind of a use. That would have a more general impact. On a neighborhood. Rather than having a specific impact. On a particular property. Thank you. That's a relief. That's a relief. And I do have Mr. Danucci with me, by the way. Who is prepared to address you. As well. If you have any questions for him. He is the owner. And he is the. Developer. And I'm given to understand if I'm not talking out of school. That one of the things that he would like to do. Is to get the construction completed. As soon as he can. So that he could perhaps move. Even have it was mother's living in there now. But maybe moved her from one floor to another. One area to another. So he's anxious to get the construction completed. As soon as he can. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 117</summary>

> Thank you. So I had it. A couple questions. I had. Okay. With Mr. Nessie with attorney Nessie in regards to some questions with the dimensional sheet. Which was reissued. So the existing. Building is. 3,900. 39. It's still quirky. So what. Is listed. As being. 39, 39, 39, 38. And 39 37. Yep. So. I had hoped that that would get cleaned up, but it's, there's still multiple. To do that. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to go with the. The. But the house will gain 84 square feet by the addition. Of this area in front. The yard itself. Is mostly. Landscaped. Correct. Because the document says that there's only 398 square feet. Of landscaping.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Darin DiNucci and Christian Klein - 795</summary>

> Darren. Yes. Go ahead. Yes. Okay. Hi, everybody. So as far as the document, Bob. 398. Feet of landscaping that that seems way off. There's there's a lot of landscaping in the, are we talking just the front yard? So it would be that all the landscaped areas on the back and the sides. Yeah, that's. That's a lot of landscaping. I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's. It's 84 square feet. Then all of a sudden it's no longer 10% of the lot area that's dedicated. To landscape area, but we can all tell by looking at the property that it's far more than that. Yeah. Much greater than that. Much greater than that. And the, and the area that we're, we're talking about, you know, Putting back. This was basically this platform has been here. For a long time. We've owned the home since the fifties and the platform's been there. With a full porch, with a full roof. That's why we shared some pictures that we were able to dig out. And we're looking. Put the porch back. The way it was, you know, including some windows to get some cover. As far as the landscaping and all that. I can honestly say, I didn't look deep into this. But I can tell you that it's a lot of landscaping. And, you know, Bob put it together for us. But yeah, there's the it's all landscaped to the whole back, the side. There's probably if I had to guess square footage wise. We've got probably 30 on the sides by 80. That's probably 2,400. We probably have. 20 by 50 in the back. That's another thousand. Yeah. 60. So. Yeah, there's a whole lot of landscaping. So something must be wrong with the, with the paperwork there. Apologize for that. No problem. Scott Lynch revised. All right. Go ahead. The other question. So the other question of usable open space. So is the. So the. The, the, the, the, the, the. And then there's a couple of landscaped areas and there's a couple of retaining walls going down. That's correct. Past that second. Past the third retaining wall. The last routine. Is that is the rear yard basically flat. Back there, or is it still sloped?  Nope. It's absolutely flat. It's way less than the, I think it's an 8%. Yeah. And I spoke with Scott about that. Cause Bob asked me to. Yeah. I would say that flat piece after that last retaining wall, I'm here right now looking out the window. That's probably. That's probably 40 by. 30, maybe just guessing. 40 By 30. Yeah. That's a big piece. Yeah. The width at 26.8 is on the drawings, the length. So I would say that. It probably meets the requirements for. Having the proper percentage of usable open space. So I would just ask that. We'll talk it over as a board, but that may, well, we may. Include as a condition, just having the. The drawing the. Information sheet be updated to be correct. Of course. Someone else do it. Okay. Okay. So those were the only. Concerns I had. I like the sketches you had provided. You know, it certainly looks like it fits in with the house. I had taken a brief look at the residential design guidelines. And essentially this is a. So the residential design guideline is designed to be a research based design. So these are the sort of small entryways. And as you said, it's in keeping with. Then the way the neighborhood is set up and the other houses, the windows are similar to other windows on, on the house. that's all fine. The only other thing I had and it's just a has nothing to do with the application but it would just sort of be a recommendation. The two steps that are shown on the sketches leading up to the front door that you might want the top step to be a lot deeper just so it's safer when you're opening that door so you're not potentially stepping backwards onto a lower step. Yeah yeah what's going to happen with that is that that concrete step's going to stay and you know if we get to complete this what happens is that's going to get built on top of with a composite style step that's going to come out and be code compliant. Okay yeah that was my only concern was just that you know having that top step be be safe when you're you know if you're going through all this effort to make it better to come into your house it would be a shame if that top step wasn't safe so yes yeah that's something to consider.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 500</summary>

> So with that I'm gonna go ahead stop the share and see if there are questions and comments from the board. See any anybody? Nope with that I will go ahead and open this hearing for public comment. Public comment is taken as it relates to the matter at hand it should be addressed through the chair. That's the raise hand button on the reactions tab if you would like to speak or just turn on your camera and wave. Last chance for public comment. Go ahead and close public comment for this hearing. So this is a an application for an enclosed entrance on the front of the building. This would extend into the front yard setback which the board is allowed to approve under 539 b or excuse me 539 a 539 a and the board there are no special conditions that the special findings that the board needs to make the board would just need to do the standards seven findings for a special permit and Mr. Nessie had read what he had included in his special permit application. That it can be approved by 539 a it's essentially desirable because the applicant would allow to enter and exit the home in all weather conditions without firstly impacting himself or the entrance to the home. There would not be an increase in traffic congestion. There would not be an overload of municipal systems. There are no additional special regulations and requested use will not impair the integrity or character of the district because it's a keeping with the physical characteristics of other homes in the neighborhood will not be out of place if the application would be approved and the proposed addition of approved would be compatible with other homes in the neighborhood. So those would be the findings and then the should the board decide to vote in favor of the application we would have the three standard conditions that were previously read into the record. I would also want to add that the applicant is to provide revised dimensional and parking information and open space gross floor area sheets correcting any deficiencies discussed at the hearing. That I would want to include that as a fourth condition. Are there any questions in regards to the findings or the proposed conditions on this application? Seeing none, the chair would entertain a motion. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. Excuse me, I move that the board approve the application subject to the three standard conditions plus the additional condition involving providing revised documentation that the chair read into the record. Second. Thank you and thank you Mr. DuPont. Thank you and thank you Mr. DuPont. So the vote of the board to approve the special permit for 77 Tanager Street with the four stated conditions. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Hanlon. Aye. Mr. Hulley. Aye. Mr. Riccardelli. Aye. And the chair votes aye. That is approved. Thank you all very much on that. Thank you. Good night. You're very welcome.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 49</summary>

> That then moves us on to 3768, 15 Moccasin Path. First, let me just say to the applicant, I apologize it's gotten so late. I thank you so much for your patience and if you could tell us your name and address and what you would like to do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Bill Nolan - 648</summary>

> So my name is Bill Nolan from Savoy Nolan Architects. Everybody can hear me? We can. I'm here representing the owner of 15 Moccasin, Scott and Chelsea Weir and I'll try to be brief given that it's late. Am I able to share my screen? Colleen, can you give Mr. Nolan sharing permission? You're all set. Great, thank you. Okay, so thank you so much. Start with the this is the existing site plan, the existing house, the one and a half story cape. And so this is the existing site right here. There's an existing one car garage that we're looking to replace with a two car and a master bedroom suite, which is essentially the project. Moving forward, everybody can see the graphics, correct? Yeah. Great. Yeah, this is the proposed site plan that shows the addition. We're conforming in all the setback requirements. The reason why we're before you is because of the size of the addition per section 5.4.2b6, an addition exceeding 750 square feet. So this is the addition in red there and I'll just quickly go through what's in your packet. So this is the existing basement. You can see largely unfinished. There's a workout room and this is a partially finished basement with laundry. This is the existing first floor, kitchen, great room, and then two smaller rooms over here and the single car garage and two bedrooms upstairs. So it's a pretty modest house. Just some existing pictures, additional cape with an extension on the left hand side, facing the street. Apologize for my printer quality. But now I'll get into the post. So we are looking to do a, I'm going to fast forward to the first floor plan. That's where you can see the majority of it. So there is a, sorry, I can't see the whole thing. Okay. So this is the existing house here. We're looking to add a little bit of room off of the back here and then fill in between the garage and the existing house with the guest office. This room exists currently. We're just enlarging it a little bit. And it's mostly to create this new mudroom piece. So from the garage, there's a transition into the house where they have some closets. That's really, we're not really even enlarging the room. We're just kind of pushing it to the rear so we can get this mudroom in. Then here's the new two-car garage on the same side. Then on the upper levels, it turns into the memory bedroom. You'll see that we achieve that with the dormer off of the back end, off of the front. Elevations. So this is the existing, I forgot to mention, sorry, to one of the existing elevations. So this is the new dormer off of the back end. Another proposal that's technically, I guess, not for you is the front entry piece, which we'll be adding on to the house. I believe we can do by right. This is the proposed addition. Garage off the side with the dormer. Kind of match the existing style. Side profile showing the back, the rear dormer, and the rear addition. This is the rear. This is the elevation that you don't see too much of the addition on except for the front entry piece. And a computer model image of what the addition will look like. Similar, it's clapboard style. I know the image is a little grainy. Clapboard to match the existing. It's a white house, so we're going to match the color. Have black windows with six over sixes, and we're proposing to match that in the existing, I'm sorry, in the proposed. Dormer is bigger than the small little A-dromers off the existing house to get space needed for the master bedroom. That's the extent of the presentation. I'm happy to field any questions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Bill Nolan - 386</summary>

> Great, thank you. Looking at this image itself, I'm very pleased that the garage is staying back away from the front of the building. I think that it helps to sort of keep the scale down and keep it back. The driveway, I just want to make sure you're aware that the the town, the maximum width for driveway is 24 feet, so just making sure that you keep that in mind. And then the only other thing is, so the dormer that you're proposing for the front of the addition, did you look at all into extending the eave line all the way across, rather than breaking it for the dormer? Yeah, we did. We preferred this. We like the aesthetic of this better. Okay, I just asked because all the other dormers, the eave is continuous, and so this is the only dormer on the house where it's not continuous. I just wanted to make sure that that was something you had considered deliberately. We did. If you'll notice, the existing dormers are actually set back from the face, from the exterior wall, where this one is flush with it, so the small little roof here wouldn't actually relate to the proportions that are on the existing house. It's a different proportion altogether, so mimicry comes from the pitches and the fact that it's an A-dormer. But we did look at it. Actually, we looked at it a couple of different ways. This is the one that we arrived on as being the one that Scott and Chelsea arrived at, is the one that they'd like to go for. Got it. The only other thing I would bring up is on the dimensional sheets, the square footage is slightly different between the two sheets. On one of them, the gross existing house is listed as being 3330 and the other is 3339, and then just that difference carries through. That proposed is 4920 on one and 4944 on the other, so if you just want to make that correction going forward, that'd be fine. It is 3339. Okay, so it's 3339 and then afterwards it's 4940, is that correct? I'm sorry, 4944? Correct. The worksheet's correct. Okay, perfect. Thank you. That was all I had. Are there other questions or comments from the board?

<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 92</summary>

> Mr. Chair? Mr. Riccadeli? I just had one. I think that the drawings look nice, the rendering you're showing looks great, feels very appropriate for the neighborhood. I just had a question about the roof lines. It looks like from the elevations, the ridgeline is almost a line between the addition and the existing home, but where those two things intersect, what's happening there? Do you have a little valley or a cricket? How are you resolving that? Yeah, there's a little cricket that you can't see. Got it, okay. Good catch.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Bill Nolan - 49</summary>

> Sorry, Mr. Chair, I forgot. It's late. It's my bedtime, so I forgot to mention that the Bouviers talked with their neighbors, and we are in receipt of four letters of support. It was submitted to Colleen, I believe, this afternoon or earlier. Were you in receipt of those?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 13</summary>

> So we have one letter that we had received previously from Mr. Franos.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Bill Nolan - 131</summary>

> I did send them as soon as I got home from work, but it's possible that Colleen had left for the day or was out by the time I got to them, so we do have those for you if you'd like them. So that's three or four in addition to the one that we have on file? I can read you the addresses if that helps. Certainly. So 19 Moccasin Path, 14 Moccasin Path, another one from 19, and 18 Moccasin Path.  And Scott, maybe you could explain it a little bit better than me, but Scott told me that they had a block party recently where they were able to share it with quite a few of their neighbors, and there seemed to be support throughout the neighborhood.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Scott Weir - 118</summary>

> Yeah, thanks, Bill. We actually happened to have a block party last weekend, and as a result of the ZBA notification to much of the neighborhood, there was a lot of awareness about what we were planning to do, and we were able to talk to a lot of neighbors and even show them pictures about what we were considering doing, and everyone, for lack of a better word, was very appeased by the aesthetic of it and sort of what we were going for, in that we were going to sort of keep the character of the house. So that was all great conversation that just happened to take place a few days prior to this meeting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 77</summary>

> Great, thank you. Are there any other members of the Board who wish to address this, have questions or comments? If not, I will go ahead and open a hearing for public comment. Public comment is taken as it relates to the matter at hand and should be directed to the Chair and help the Board in its deliberations, and may do the raise hand feature under reactions or turn on your camera and wave. Mr. Moore.

<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 98</summary>

> Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. I was trying to look at this property on Google Maps and also square that with what I saw in the street view, and I don't know, there must be some differentiation in the age of the pics. I'm wondering, in one set of street view picture, there were some significant trees in the front and side yards, and in another one I saw, there was no trees. And I'm wondering what the tree history is, if I could ask through you, Mr. Chair. Certainly. If Mr. Brigg could.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Brigg - 117</summary>

> Yeah, I'll be happy to answer that. So we bought this house in the spring of 2021, and when we bought it, every tree that we bought it with is still standing. To that end, there was construction done on this property by the previous owners, and what trees they may or may not have taken down, I'm not exactly privy to. But I think I know the pictures you're alluding to, prior to that construction, when it was a yellow ranch without the expansion. Yes. Yes. And I think they're just outdated, considerably outdated at this point. But those trees have been long gone. I couldn't even tell you necessarily where they were in the yard.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 30</summary>

> Okay, Mr. Chair, that's helpful. And I saw also, you said all the trees are now standing. Is this project going to be impacting the trees that are now standing?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Brigg - 71</summary>

> There is no impact. There is no impact. Again, I'm not an arborist, but my understanding is there's going to be no impact to any of the trees on our property. We trim back one small section in order to give us access to get equipment in. Those are on side trees between my own yard and my neighbor's. But outside of that, we don't plan to touch any of the...
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 93</summary>

> Okay. All right, Mr. Chair, that's good news. It was hard to tell from those pics about what trees were there and what was going to be taken. But you're saying no trees are really planned to be taken at this point? That's correct. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Oh, you're welcome. Thank you. Those pictures on Google Street View are from 2007. So they are considerably old. I should have known from the lack of resolution. I tried to find the date, but I didn't find it. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 778</summary>

> You're welcome. And I would just note that the applicant will have to file a tree plan as a part of the permitting process. So there will be some review of existing trees on the property. And if there's a determination that some additional protection of measures need to be taken, those should be taken. be noted by the by the tree warden at that time. Are there any other members of the public who wish to address this hearing? Seeing none, I will go ahead and close the public comment period for this hearing. So what the board has before it, this is a special a request for special permit for a large addition under 542B6. The board needs to make three findings in regards to this large addition in addition to the seven standard determinations that it needs to make. The first is that the alteration or addition is in harmony with other structures and uses in the vicinity. As has been said several times, this is very much in keeping with the character of the neighborhood. This is an area with a lot of that sort of that two family, excuse me, the two-story house as opposed to two and a half. So it's mostly one and a half to two stories. This is in keeping with that, keeps the nice horizontal plane and is very similar to the to the houses around it. Board is to consider dimensions and setbacks in relation to abutting structures and uses. This is an extension towards the neighboring house at 11 Moccasin Path, but it does not violate the the setback conditions and it is still maintaining that same height that the house is today. And consider conformity with the purposes of the bylaw. So I think that the addition here where it is making the house more usable for the existing owners and providing some additional space for them while minimizing the impact on neighbors and the district is what the purpose of the bylaw would be. And then for the standard seven conditions, it's been put forward by the applicant that a single-family residential is allowed in the R1 and that a large addition can be approved by a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals. The requested use is essential or desirable to the public. It's an allowed use, it would continue as a single-family residence keeping with the neighborhood. I would also note that it helps to modernize the house by providing additional garage space and living space for the family. The requested use will not create undue traffic congestion or unduly impair pedestrian safety. It is the same use as before, same family, no additional vehicles. Explain why the requested use will not overload public water drainage or sewer systems. For the same reason, it is still maintaining as a single-family home so there will be no impact on those. Describe how special regulations for use may be provided in the zoning bylaw. As we noted, that is the large addition. Explain why the requested use will not impair the integrity or character of the district. We note that it is the same existing use from before and after but also the same as the adjacent homes and consistent with the character of the district. It will not, by its addition to the neighborhood, cause an excess of the use that could be detrimental to the character of the neighborhood. Existing house, it's maintaining the character of the neighborhood by maintaining the single-family residence. So those would be my proposed findings for this application. Should the board decide to vote in favor, there would be the three standard conditions that we had read previously into the record this evening. There's a very minor typo in the form so I don't think it's necessary to have the applicant go through the process of revising the documentation because it is correct on the one and it's just a typo on the other. Are there any additional conditions that the board would want to impose on the special permit grant? No. Mr. Hanlon? No. Okay then with that the chair would entertain a motion. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I move that the application be approved subject to the three standard conditions. Second. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. There's a motion to approve the special permit for 15 Moccasin Path with the three conditions before by Mr. Hanlon, seconded by Mr. DuPont. Vote of the board. Mr. DuPont? Aye. Mr. Hanlon?  Aye. Mr. Hawley? Aye. Mr. Ricardelli? Aye. And the chair votes aye. The special permit for 15 Moccasin Path is approved. Thank you very much.
