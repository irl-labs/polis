<details><summary>Docket #3764 212 Pleasant Street (continuance)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 43</summary>

> So with that, the next item on our agenda is docket number 3764212 Pleasant Street. It's a continuance of a prior hearing. And I would ask the applicant, Ms. Aikenhead, to introduce herself and bring us up to speed on where we are.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 1561</summary>

> Okay. Hi, I'm Nellie Aikenhead. I'm one of the applicants. Mark Halliday is also here. He's the other applicant. There's a few things that have been going on. One is to establish the average finished grade. And another is to answer some of the abutters' requests for information. I can also restate our request, but maybe you already know that we should maybe do the finished grade first, I was thinking. Sure. Let's go ahead and address that. I can bring up the plan. Oh, yeah. I can also share my screen if you want. That would be great. Colleen, do you mind giving Ms. Aikenhead that permission? Yep. You should be all set now. I should be? Okay. Yep. You should be able to share screen. Can you see it or no? Not yet. Now? There we go. Yes. Okay, good. So, basically, I know the most probably important and critical question is the question about the average rate. I thought I could address that first, and then as the board sees fit, I can reply to the questions and accusations from the abutters and their attorneys. They, in my opinion, are the ones that are most likely to be the ones that to the questions and accusations from the abutters and their attorneys. They have implied that we haven't been transparent or provided any details, but in fact, about 90% of their concerns have already been publicly vetted and approved by town boards, including the CONSCOM, the Historic District Commission, and as part of those processes, the Engineering Department and the Tree Board. But starting with the average finished grade, on August 28th, as I'm sure you all know, the ISD issued a memo stating that our average finished grade was 12.71 feet, and therefore with the basement ceiling height of 19 feet, our basement met the definition of a story. We have since then had several conversations with ISD and subsequently had our surveyor correct and add information to our survey, including the following. One, the elevation measurements now reflect the town's standard methodology for a sloped lot, which means that the measurements are taken at 0.6 feet away from the dwelling rather than on the corner of the buildings. Two, the rear elevations, which are shown here, are now based on the height of the future retaining wall at the back of the house. The location, type, and size of the wall was included in our notice of intent application to the Conservation Commission, which was approved in June 2022. The formal order of conditions were recorded with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on July 21st. We proposed a wall on the eight-foot contour line, two to three feet, approximately two to three feet high, which brings the elevation up to about 11.2, I think. Three, we clarified that the bump out at the back of the house was a deck, not finished space, so the six foot off the house measurement is around here rather than six foot off the deck, which is 14 feet off the house. When the ISD calculated the 12.71 foot average finished grade, they were measuring six feet off the deck or 14 feet off the house. Because this is a real steep area, it had a big impact on the calculation. And finally, we have all measurements are now based on proposed rather than existing elevations. The average grade is calculated at 14.64 feet with a basement ceiling height of 19 feet. The differential is 4.34 feet, which is less than four and a half feet, so therefore it's not a story. The abutters have implied that these are my numbers, but they are not. These calculations were made by a licensed surveyor based on in the field instrument data collection, which was used to create a signed, certified, recordable survey. We had nothing to do with the numbers other than the fine-tuning the methodology that the building department preferred to use. I can go on to other things that they've questioned, or maybe we want to have a discussion about this first. Why don't you go ahead and continue? Okay, so they've questioned a bunch of stuff, including parking, drainage, GFA, steps to the pond, scale amassing, etc. The abutters have stated that the existing parking is unsafe and insufficient, and at the same time, they are objecting to our proposed improvements. We can and have parked two cars in the existing paved area, and we can and have been able to turn around at the end of our driveway and drive up facing forward. It does take a bit of maneuvering, which is why we are proposing and have had approved an increase in the existing 20 by 24 impervious parking area to a slightly larger 22 by 29 foot parking area. This proposal is part of the notice of intent, which was submitted to the Conservation Commission in May 2022, and we had two public meetings. Many abutters were there, and it was approved by the Conservation Commission in June 2022. The abutters have also claimed that we haven't provided any details on water flow and drainage. The opposite is true. Here are the details on our proposed parking area. We're proposing gravel with a 40% void that will be able to collect water. We have a true grid permeable paver system at the top with smaller stone. This is a profile of what the system will look like, and the water capture of the area, 22 by 29 by 6 inches deep, which is 319 cubic feet, will be approximately 958 gallons of water. Not only do we propose this to the Conservation Commission and get their approval, they ran it by the town engineer, Wayne Chouinard, who added a few more stipulations that had to do with soil types and depth of the stone base, and he also signed off on this proposal. It's very detailed. It's not no information. Furthermore, the neighbors have questioned our calculations of the changes from pervious to impervious surfaces. Those calculations were reviewed and approved by the assistant town engineer, Bill Papathon, as part of our stormwater management application that was filed with our special permit application in January 2023, so those have been addressed. Another question that the abutters have raised is the so-called lack of details for the replacement of these cinder block steps going down to the pond. Again, this is part, this is taken from our notice of intent that was submitted to the Conservation Commission in May 2022 and approved in June 2022. We provided many details. These steps do not need code. They're unstable, and they're diverting the water to the left side where it's eroding the soil and undermining our retaining wall. We have proposed to create 12 new steps with the 7-inch risers located over 20-foot distance with a 7-foot drop from the parking area to the mostly flat lower level of the path, where this spacing will allow for equidistant 1-foot, 8-inch long treads to the back portion that's filled in with permeable bedding and gravel, slightly compacted to form a foundation for the left front granite. This is not, no details. It's particularly disingenuous of the abutters to object to this because the owners of 216 Pleasant Street installed these concrete steps on our property, and the abutters at 218 Pleasant Street subsequently clear-cut this land, which is our property. They didn't have our permission, they didn't inform us, and they didn't tell the conservation commission that they were doing this work in 100% back. And now, when we want to fix it by creating this, we're getting a lot of grief. I think the last big question that the abutters raised in their last letter was the gross floor area. The neighbors are questioning our figures in the application because they include the basement. They referred to this definition in section 2 of the zoning bylaw, which is a very short definition of what GFA means. They neglected to consider the larger definition in section 5.3.22, which specifically states that the basement areas, except as excluded to below, which is the systems area, are included in GFA. So we included it in our figures as is required by this definition. I guess one last thing is that they, via Butters, this is specifically the Garber House chart of lot coverage, saying that our lot coverage is higher by twice as much as the other three lots around us. They cherry pick the data showing only three supersized over-sized lots with 21,000 square feet, 16,700 square feet, and 19,000 square feet of land compared to ours at 6,800 square feet of land. So, of course, we have the most lot coverage. The Garber House, where our closest of Butters do not include their own property. We need more fair when looking at this data from the Historic District Commission, look at every single property from group two to 206 Pleasant, which is the last house on Spy Pond, and the results were very different. I don't have, I thought that professional services might write a memo. They said they would on the average finished grade. I don't have that, but I have this little sticky note from Dave saying, okay, as long as conservation said okay to the retaining wall.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 658</summary>

> Yep. Great, thank you for that. So the board did receive, after the end of closing today, a memo from Inspectional Services. So if I can go ahead, I'm gonna grab the sharing here. And where's the memo? There we go. So hopefully you see the memo docket 3764212 Pleasant Street that's a single family dwelling on Spy Pond, our one applicant seeking special permit for two-story addition, 942 square feet. The applicant applied to Conservation Commission due to the proximity based on the application to the Conservation Approval Minutes from 6-16-22. The current renderings of the property by the architect to include a retaining wall, the basement will no longer be considered a story once the application conditions are met. Inspector Geldart reviewed the site plan with the proposed retaining wall. And if the wall is built according to the plan approved by Conservation, the basement will not qualify as a story. And the Historic District Commission has also extended the approval for the project, excuse me, until January 27th, 2024. So that's the information that was provided by Inspectional Services. So the application that was before the board, and if the initial application, it is a special permit for a large addition because the addition that is, and a large addition only includes gross floor area that is outside of the existing foundation for the structure. So in this case, it is that front, or what we refer to as the front right corner, which is approximately 942 square feet. And there was some question about whether or not the basement would be included in that calculation. So I did want to go back to that section of the by-law, which I'll go over in a second. 22, there we are. All right, so this is the by-law, the following areas of buildings are to be included in the calculation of gross floor area. Obviously we have no elevator shafts. There's no stairwell in this part of the building, the attic area. This does not have an attic in this area. Interior mezzanines, there are no interior mezzanines, there's no penthouses. The basement areas are included, except as excluded, if they're exclusively for mechanical uses accessory to the operation of the building. Cellars are included, and the difference of a basement is just that more than 50% of it is exposed, and then the cellar is less than 50% is exposed above grade. Porches are included, and garages, except as included in the one below. So for this application, although the, so the lower, the lowest floor is not considered a story. So the building does not rise above two and a half floors, but according to the plans, that portion of the building on the lowest level is identified, let me go ahead and just change the sharing on this. So this is that lowest floor, it's identified as an indoor-outdoor room on a new concrete slab. So obviously it is not a utility room, and then above it is a living room, entry mudroom space, and on top will be a bedroom. So the full portion of that would be included in the gross floor area. So the intended addition in gross floor area still exceeds 750 square feet. So the need for a special permit for a large addition remains. And so because of that, the board, in addition to the regular findings that the board would be required to make for a special permit, the board would also need to find that the alteration or addition is in harmony with other structures and uses in the vicinity. We would need to consider the dimensions and setbacks in relation to abutting structures and uses, and we would need to consider conformity with the purposes of the bylaw. Those are the additional findings that are required under the Zoning Bylaw for a large addition. With that, are there any additional questions from the board?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 55</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Riccardelli. Can I just ask one question in relation to the square footage? So I think the applicant mentioned 936 square feet was added to the building, but the addition on the data spreadsheet is 1,600 square feet. So if the applicant could just clarify what the difference is between those numbers.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 100</summary>

> Okay, so I don't have the spreadsheet right with me, but there's a second story, and then there's an addition, and they're two separate things. So maybe the total is 1,600. I'm not exactly sure. I'm not looking at my papers. One thing I did want to mention was that I did ask for 936 square feet addition, but in fact, I realized that floor one and floor two have a cantilever that are about 40 feet bigger than the footprint. So in fact, if you count the 312 plus 352 and 352, it's about just over 1,000 square feet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 59</summary>

> Okay, understood. So there's about 1,000 square feet of addition, and then the rest is a new second floor that's on the existing footprint of the house. Correct, and because some of it has a slanted ceiling, it's not a full square second floor, it's not the exact same size as the first floor. Okay, thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 274</summary>

> Thank you. Other members of the board with questions? Seeing none, hearing none. We'll move on to public comment. So I will, in a moment, I'll open the meeting for public comment. Remind the public that public questions and comments are taken only as they relate to the matter at hand and should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing our decision. Members of the public will be granted time to ask questions and make comments. Members of the public who wish to speak should digitally raise their hand using the button on the reactions tab in the Zoom application. Those calling in by phone can dial star nine to indicate you would like to speak. You'll be called upon by myself. You'll be asked to give your name and address. You'll be given time for your questions and comments. All questions are to be addressed through the chair. Please remember to speak clearly. Anyone wishing to address the board a second time during any particular hearing, the chair will allow those wishing to speak for the first time to speak first. And once all public questions and comments have been addressed, then the public comment period will be closed. We will do our best to show documents as they are requested. So with that, I will open the public comment period. So if there are members of the public who wish to address the board, please go ahead and use the raise hand feature. The first hand I see raised is John Garber. If you could give your name and address for the record and provide us with your comment.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Garber - 1827</summary>

> Yes, of course. Thanks so much to the chair and the ZBA. So I'm John Garber. I'm here with my wife, Sabrina. We live at 214 Pleasant Street and we have our kids, Alfie and Miles. They're six years old. I think we're probably the closest to Butters. The house at 212 is about nine feet from our property line. So we've submitted some comments and questions in writing and I'll try to keep this really brief just because it's been a long process here. I think just for our own mental health, I just wanted to state that it's been just extremely frustrating, just how hard it's been to get basic information during this process. I think we've had a number of questions and the applicant does point out that we've had some requests for information. This has been really going on since last February and even before that. And it's been just a ton of effort to get clear answers. It took essentially eight months to get a plan that actually shows the location of that new retaining wall and the extent of the filling that's gonna be required to regrade the rear yard. This is really the first that we've seen of this major aspect of this project on an actual plan. It's been almost a year and it's been really quite hidden. And I think naturally it just makes us really nervous that we just don't yet still have a complete picture. I think we're nervous that we just don't know what we don't know. And it's really tough for us to kind of really fully feel like we're able to assess the impact and it's just not clear exactly what's being done. And it comes out in kind of drips and it's like pulling teeth sometimes. And I think that post-it note from the inspector was interesting that seems okay as long as it's built according to the Conservation Commission, plans that were approved. And I guess I'm just curious if anything among all of what was submitted and reviewed by the Conservation Commission actually shows a plot where that retaining wall is. And I don't think there is because I think we've poured over those documents trying to understand exactly what's going to happen. And I don't think that that's part of that package that's been approved. So it's hard to see how that's going to happen. I think the parking issue has come up and there is a plan to increase that parking area from a current area, I think it's 480 square feet up to around 640 square feet. So that's about by a third. And it's a spot that we think really does fit just one car. And I think our concern is that the plans still really lack detail about how this change is going to be accomplished. I would say even on the plot plans that say proposed plan, it still just simply says parking existing. And it may seem like a trivial issue but that parking area is bound on one side by our property line and on the other side by the property line of 218 Pleasant Street. So I think it's just really important to us that we understand exactly how the space is going to be reconfigured and it's just missing on all of the plans that we've ever seen. I think more importantly, we do have concerns and I don't want them to be dismissed about the safety of actually having two cars parked there. I think with two cars parked there, there really is just not enough room for either car to turn around. And to make a safe forward facing exit. And I think what actually happens is, a driver needs to drive in reverse up the shared driveway and then they need to use our driveway to turn around. And I would say over the past six months or so, we've seen a series of Airbnb guests who have been staying there. And consistently this is what happens. Sometimes they'll ask my kids to like stop riding their bikes or to stop like chalk drawing on the driveway so they can use our driveway as a turnaround. And so I just, I couldn't disagree more. Like when the applicant writes as part of the criteria for the special permit that the traffic patterns and it won't be affected and impact to pedestrians won't be, there will be no impact. You know, I swear I see this, my kids see it, we see this impact like every day. And I think having two cars there with the total inability to actually safely turn around and maneuver and make a forward exit is gonna be a real, something that's gonna make us nervous. So I think, you know, all along, we've kind of made this request that we see some detailed plans and I think it's reasonable to see plans that actually show how that parking area will be increased by 33% and sort of logistically how a car, if there's two cars there, will safely turn around. And, you know, I know that members of the ZBA have come down previously for like a site visit. I would definitely welcome you to come back and bring your car and just try to maneuver in and out safely and then try to imagine it with like a second car park there. It's really tough. You know, I think in terms of the, you know, the difficulty getting information and I think returning back to, I think the more fundamental point here of, is what's being proposed in harmony and in scale with the neighborhood and with its proximity to the pond. You know, it was by like a lot of effort that mostly like Sabrina figured out, you know, ambushing the town inspector and try to really understand like how you measure these things like average finished grade and what defines a story. And it was only by like a lot of effort that we figured out, you know, that the existing house is actually like a two-story house. And so it's two stories and the project is proposing to build up and build another story on top. And, you know, the end result is a two-story house. And I think like intuitively there's just something really unsettling about that. There's just, it's like on a gut level, I just, you know, it's hard for me to kind of understand that. And I realized it's literally by like moving the earth behind the house, like increasing the elevation of the earth like about three feet or more, that this plan is gonna basically enable a three-story house to be built, you know, 65 feet away from the water's edge and 20 feet from our house. And I think that's why like all of the abutters, you know, it's very close to, you know, the whole house is very close to each other. And I think that's why it's elicited such a strong, you know, such a strong and kind of unanimous reaction because I think just on a gut level, we realized this house is just so massive and like out of scale with this neighborhood and with the nature of being this close to the water. I just have like two other, two more comments and then I'll wrap this up. I think we've all seen these plans, like since the original submission back in February and like there's been some additions to it, there's been some clarifications, like the plans haven't changed like one inch. And I think for us, it's just been this really apparent kind of lack of willingness to like listen and hear the neighbor's concerns and to try to find some sort of even sort of, you know, minimal sort of compromise here. You know, I think when we saw that this was coming back, you know, back to the ZBA for discussion, we, you know, we thought for sure the plans must be changed in some way. We could, you know, maybe re-initiate a dialogue and see if there's some common ground we could find. And, you know, we reached out to Nellie and Mark, to the applicant and, you know, the response we got was, you know, happy to meet anytime, but to be clear, our plans are not changing. And, you know, I think that this is just such a departure from the way additions were done at, you know, 206, 210, 214. I think in all of those cases, there was like input from the surrounding neighbors that was sought out and the additions really met with their approval and had the support of the neighbors. I think in this case, it's really just a very different situation. And the final comment I just want to make is that, you know, I just, I wanted to stress that, like, we're definitely not opposed to construction. We are not opposed to change. We're opposed to this project, like in its current form. You know, we've, you know, I mentioned we've had twins. They're six years old. We moved in literally three weeks before they were born. They've grown up in the house. They've grown up, you know, next to the water, wildlife. They love like the garden, outdoors, sunlight, air, all of the natural beauty of like being right here next to the pond and being in this part of Arlington. And I think when we like think about how our actions, you know, affect our neighbors and we think about like the benefits and the obligations of being part of a community, you know, I think the question of what can be done, you know, whether it's like by right or a special permit, you know, for us, that would never outweigh the consideration of what should be done because it's the right thing to do as like a neighbor and as a citizen of the town. So I think you'll hear from other like neighbors tonight. I, you know, we all love our homes. We love our neighborhood, but we're not opposed to construction. We're not opposed to doing like much needed renovations to like this cottage that needs some love, but we're opposed to the project in its current form, just given the scale and that like disharmony and the impact to the neighborhood. And that's really, I think, our main issue. And that's all. I think we wanted to thank you for listening and being very thoughtful throughout. This has been a really long process, but we really appreciate the chance to be heard. We hope that the board could use some of what's in its power to really encourage an outcome that would be fair to the applicant and fair to the neighbors and good for the neighborhood and the town. And that's really it. Thanks.

> Thank you very much. The next on the list is Shou Isaac. Hi. My voice, I caught a very bad cold. So the document we saw today is actually the first time. I just need to ask you to repeat your name and address for the record. Oh, okay. Hi, this is Shou Isaac. I'm at 218 Pleasant Street, Arlington with my husband, Ibrahim Isaac. And sorry for my voice. I just caught a very bad cold. Also, so the document we saw today is actually the first time I saw in this long discussion over a year, I think. We've been asking 212 to provide more information. And I even formed a meeting with all the neighbors together. And I asked her, can you provide more detail to us? And she said, everything was online. And I said, I didn't see any engineer plan or any other plans. Can you provide more? Or can you email me? Sadly, I didn't get anything until today. I mean, everything I can see is always on CBA meeting. And so all the discussion or all the question or answer have to find out in this discussion on the CBA meeting as well. That's a little bit disappointing and frustrating. So a few things I would like to address. First of all, parking. The picture that 212 showed on the right side of the red arrow she point, it actually belongs to 218. That's our property. And then we find a surveyor that put a nail on it. So the whole parking space not belongs to 212. There's a partial belongs to 218. So yes, they can park two cars, but they have really big trouble to turn around. Like John just mentioned, they're aiming their guest and even their tenant has a lot of trouble to, don't say turn around, just park one car, one SUV over there. We have a lot of their guests, their tenant has to use our shared driveway or even our own driveway. There's one instance that their guest has to park in my entrance of my driveway and block it for 10 minutes and I cannot get out and I have to just wait there. And that's not okay. So another thing is there's no answer about 10 feet setback of right side staircase tour to 218 property. They're going to build a staircase tour to our property, but on the plan or application they submit before, the number was changed a lot. Sometimes it says 13 feet, sometimes it says nine feet. So today this question is not getting answered. Another thing is 212 expressed that 218 was claimed to lay a property without communicating with them. On that picture, there's an orange flag pole over there. On the right side actually belongs to us. All we do, we didn't claim that thing. All we do, we just take out the fence that was marked wrong by previous owner. And also I wish they did mention that they also come to our property to turn our tree without communicating with us. That actually, I almost call a cop for that. So I don't understand that why I try to form multiple meetings and get more details or plans from 212, but I never get it and I only can get in CBN meeting. It's frustrating and it's sadly and all my concern was not addressed as well. So I don't know what else I can say or trying to push forward to be more nice neighbor to 212. That's all. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Rebecca Gruber - 243</summary>

> Thank you very much. Next on the list is Rebecca Gruber. Good evening. Thank you for letting me speak on this matter. Rebecca Gruber, 215 Pleasant Street. So I live directly across the street from where all of this will be happening. Pleasant Street's a busy street. So a lot is always going on in Pleasant Street. And again, as has been reiterated, I don't think anyone's opposed to the changes. Although the process of construction, et cetera, will be burdensome on everyone. I'm now concerned though, about this issue of the second car. There is almost no parking on Pleasant Street. In fact, the parking that's available starts right outside my driveway. And there are often cars parked across the street because there's tree work happening. Somebody's getting a driveway paved. Somebody has guests. If this second car doesn't fit well down at the 212 property and is going to end up being parked in the very few spaces available on Pleasant Street on an ongoing basis, this will be a huge problem. Technically, I do not believe you're allowed to park there all day, but the police don't have the time to come check that. And certainly we don't want to be bothering them with that. So it's very important that there be appropriate parking on people's private areas and not have constant parking on the few spots available on Pleasant Street for all of the neighbors to use. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 55</summary>

> Thank you. Then next on our list is Ms. Aikenhead, but do you want to speak now or do you want to? I was going to have you come back once I've heard more comments. I can wait. I can wait. Okay, great. Thank you. Then the next on the list is Chia Yun Sun.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chia Yun Jessica Sun - 842</summary>

> Hi. Thank you. So my name is Chia Yun Jessica Sun. I live in 216 Pleasant Street with my husband, Matt Dawson, and unfortunately, he can't join us on the call today. I have three main things I want to address, and some of this might be a repeat of what's been talked about, and I'll try to be brief because we've heard some of them already. And I think the first one is really the communication piece that either two of others had talked about. Although Nellie and Mark are open to have conversations, but I often felt kind of dismissed and found that they are not really open to receive our feedback or address some of the concerns that we posed back in March this year. We all had our letters and lists of concerns. And again, this is really nothing personal against Nellie and Mark. I do want to kind of respond to a couple of points that was talked about. I think Nellie mentioned the bar graph, and I'm sorry I'm not very good at the technicality, but the bar graph of the percentage of the footprint of the house to the land. And I want to just point out that the different houses that were shown were specifically lakefront, like kind of immediate abutters and in our neighborhood. But we think like the lakefront property were kind of important to talk about. And then the other minor point is, I think one of the plans that was shown is similar to what was presented to the conservation committee in 2022. But one of the pictures that was in that, that was very recent. I think that was shown with a 2018 kind of taking away some of the invasive species. I think those pictures were pretty recent. So I was just curious, are there more submissions?  Like are there updated submissions we should be aware of? And I would really share like what John at 214 had mentioned, like it's pretty unsettling for us because it's really like the minor technicality of what counts as a floor. So it's the finished average grade, whether that now does not count as a floor. I think that really does feel pretty unsettling. And I think the second point to talk about, again, it might be repeat with what some of the concern that's mentioned, but this has specific impact to our house, 216 Plaza and Street, because we do have deeded easement that goes through the lake. And that easement would go by, I think Natalie's property before shows property. So it's kind of two different properties, but we have a six feet wide easement and we're pretty concerned about how these new proposed plan will impact that. Cause I just want to point out in the updated plot survey that was uploaded last week, still does not show the sidesteps that was in, I believe in the plotted plan, but it was not shown in the survey where, because in the survey there is our easement, but we don't know how far the addition might go into our easement. So that's something we've been requesting, we'd really like to see. So that's about steps. And another one is really the parking plan that you've heard many times. I don't, because it's not shown on the survey. So we don't quite know how the 480 square feet current plan is indicated. And also like what would the, more importantly, what would the proposed plan? That's still something unclear to us. And we just really want to avoid getting into any kind of issues in the future. So I would really like to see that. And that's again, tied to the DEDA easement. And I think finally it's really about the history and the characters of the neighborhood. So we live in 216 Pleasant Street and I think next year it will be, our house will be 170 years old. And if you think of our cul-de-sac, I believe our house is the first one that was built. I feel proud and also a lot of responsibility. As some of you know, like an old house comes with a lot of work and we're incredibly cognizant of the responsibility. I do feel like I want to maintain the character of our house and also the neighborhood. And I think the proposed plan, I don't want to repeat everything we stated in our letter. It's on the docket. We really believe the proposed plan is completely out of proportion, even though it's stated as a three bedroom home. If you look at the details, I think there's enough of an alcove. It's really a four bedroom house. And like some of the butter has said, yeah, we can't disagree more and really think this will negatively impact the health, our mental health, the morale, character, history, and integrity of this neighborhood. And that preserving that is extremely important to us. So thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.

<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 226</summary>

> Absolutely. Thank you so much. Next on our list is Steve Moore. Well, yes. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. I must say I am impressed by the strength of feeling that the speakers are all talking. And it's fairly important to folks. I am not an abutter. I'd like to ask for you, Mr. Chair, of the applicant. She had chosen pictures of concrete cinder block steps that are going to be replaced by a more landscape set of steps that had erosion on one side of the picture. And also a picture was shown of some cleared area, which she claimed had been cleared without approval since it was her land. I'd like to know a little more about that. Did that occur? I mean, we just heard from the last speaker that they have an easement. Now, an easement doesn't allow folks to modify the land that they have an easement over, but it does allow them to pass on it. And I'm wondering, does the owner feel that they performed something illegal when they did what they did? And furthermore, why did, I guess I don't understand why, even though it's an easement, why they would feel that the abutters were allowed to put in stairs. I don't understand that. Is my understanding clear of what I thought was presented?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 28</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Moore. I would ask Ms. Aikenhead, so the concrete steps that were put in, were those put in before or after you purchased the property?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 306</summary>

> Okay, so the concrete steps, I believe, were there before we bought the property. I'm not 100% sure. The clearing of the land next to that was after we bought the property just recently. Sorry, if you're facing the pond, looking down the stairs, was the area that was cleared to the right of that or to the left of that? To the right of the stairs. Okay, thank you. So, honestly, we didn't want to make a fuss about either thing, but we're in a tough spot because we're getting so much fuss about what we want to do to fix it, which is really just to be nice to the neighbors, because we don't need that ourselves for access. We just thought we want to get rid of those concrete blocks and put in something better so that 216, which is the big house that has the easement, can get to the pond. So, it's not something we have to do. It's something that we thought would be nice to do. Different easements have different terms. 216 has an easement to pass and repass on foot to go to the pond. They don't have an easement to build steps. They don't have an easement to store boats. They don't have an easement to make any improvements, but they have the right to pass and repass. We wanted to make it a little nicer for them. There are other easements on this property, including one that we have, which is an easement to use the driveway and the right-of-ways for all purposes that roads include, including laying conduit, paving and repaving, putting in gas lines, putting in electricity. Our easement that we have to get from our house to Pleasant Street is very different than the easement that 216 has to get to the pond.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Moore, Nellie Aikenhead, Christina Klein - 250</summary>

> Okay, thank you for that. Mr. Chairman, does that answer your question? That answers my question, and so the steps that are going to be installed by the applicant, as shown in the shared screen right now, is for the use of both the applicant and the neighbors availing themselves of the easement. Correct. I don't think we really will need them because we have direct pond access, but we could use them. Okay, thank you. And lastly, I also heard Airbnb get mentioned a number of times, and I don't know if that was in relation to the applicant's property or one of the other neighbors. This is going to be an owner-occupied property, correct? Okay, so there's two different Airbnbs going on. On our property, we had it empty for six months while we were going through this process. That cost us $15,000, so we put it on Airbnb. We had it rented for a couple months. We now have longer-term tenants in there. Our intent was to move down there. This has been a very contentious and unpleasant process for us, so I don't know if we will actually move down there. We might end up doing something else. Shao and Abraham in the blue house next door to us have two Airbnbs in their own house that have nothing to do with us. Okay, all right. That clears it up for me. This is certainly a complicated case, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Moore.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 274</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? Yes, Mr. Hanlon. So, when the Chair opened the public comment period, he included a direction to try to address the issues that give the Board the information that it needs to have in order to decide the case. At least from my point of view, disputes back and forth about the easement and what the easement covers and whether anyone has intruded on the easement, those are legal things. We always kind of assume that, for our purposes, that the private legal issues have been addressed. I am not sure that there is anything that was said, although it was very heartfelt. Obviously, people have had experiences which are not particularly pleasant for them. They are not helping me. We have gone pretty long already. What we need to understand better is how all of this fits into the statute that we are trying to enforce. I would just like to encourage the people who continue to talk to us to focus on that. I have been impressed by the willingness of some of the neighbours who have each said that they would be prepared to do some sort of compromise. They at least talk about something that would be a modification. That would be a useful thing to at least further discuss. But beyond that, we need to understand what it is that is going on here that will affect and how it will affect the criteria that we have to apply. And I just like to encourage people to focus on that issue because that's the issue that, that's the discussion that will be most helpful to the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Tamara Joseph - 485</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. So next on the speaker's list is Tamara Joseph. Thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak here. I think I'm the last of the abutters. I'm in 210 Pleasant Street. So on the lake right next to 212, that the current home is 10 feet from the property line and there are 22 feet that separate the two homes. My husband and I and our son moved here in June, 2008. So 15 plus years enjoying the pond. My son was five at the time. He's grown up and gone to college now. We have watched additions be built at 206 and 208 over the past 15 years. The experience there was different. It was a much more collegial and interactive process. We are very concerned about the proposed bill. Like others here, we are not against this property being developed, being improved, but what is being proposed, we believe will negatively impact the enjoyment of our home and the neighborhood in general. This is a unique neighborhood with historic importance where the homes are extremely close together. The plans for 212, if approved by the ZBA, would negatively impact our views, privacy and noise levels, both inside and outside the home. We are also worried that it might impact the foundation of the home, given the close proximity of the homes, either through changed drainage, replacement of this retaining wall, the details of which we are just learning, or the greater weight of this new structure. I've submitted a letter which notes how the proposed plans are inconsistent with Arlington design guidelines and bylaws. Problems posed by these plans appear to be precisely what animated the creation of those design guidelines so that Arlington's older homes would not be replaced by new homes that were outsized and inharmonious with the surrounding neighborhood. I have submitted photos taken from the lake, showing the shoreline, and of course, the ZBA has also taken the time to see this area for itself and appreciate the impact that this proposed home would have on the harmony of this neighborhood. Finally, I will mention the applicants have never sought to meet with my husband and I, although we are the residents who have lived here the longest. We are renters and not homeowners, but I believe that we still have an interest here. We are not going anywhere and long time here. Nevertheless, we have continued to engage in this dialogue, requesting additional information regarding drainage, elevation, window placement, parking spaces, landscaping, and hardscaping. That information is still not complete despite the very long time that the application has been pending and the numerous submissions that have occurred. We therefore urge the ZBA to reject this application for all of the reasons that have been cited, and we thank everyone for your time and attention to this important matter. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 53</summary>

> Looking at the speaker's list, the only other hand is Mr. Moore seeking a second time. Mr. Moore. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair, second time around. I wanna thank Mr. Handel for his comment. He's right about redirection and refocus, and I apologize for taking the conversation away from the decision, thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 358</summary>

> Thank you. Thank you. Are there any further members of the public who wish to address this hearing this evening?  There was one or two other hands that were up before, but were taken down, so I just wanted to make sure that everyone was aware. I do not see any additional hands. I do see a wave. Ms. Sun, did you wish to speak? No? Okay. Looking through the screen. Do not see anyone else. Okay, with that then, I will go ahead and close the public comment portion of the hearing. So that brings us back to the board. So again, just to reiterate what we had at the start, so this is a, excuse me, a request for a special permit for a large addition under section 542B6. In addition to the regular findings which the board needs to make, which are in section 333, the board has three additional findings it needs to make. It would need to find that the alteration or addition is in harmony with other structures and uses in the vicinity. It would need to consider whether the dimensions and setbacks in relation to abutting structures and uses are appropriate and consider the conformity with the purposes of the bylaw. So I think there's a lot of the abutters and the neighbors and the other residents have said this is a fairly unique situation in town. It gets pretty obvious at one point, there would have been one house with a lot of shore access and that has been subdivided into a number of smaller parcels, all of which are very close together and really very intertwined in terms of access to them and sort of moving in and about the district. And then also in terms of access to the shoreline that there are easements that are in place to preserve access. And then the situation is really fairly unique to this set of like four or five houses. And then once you start moving towards the center, again, they become the much longer, larger lots. With one or two buildings upon them. So there were several themes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 64</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Hanlon. I was kind of hoping that there'd be an opportunity for board discussion before we got into the summary of the case and I wondered if we could do that. If Mr. Aiken had had previously deferred answering some things until the commentary was all over and I at least have a few questions that I'd like to ask.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Patrick Hanlon - 445</summary>

> Oh, absolutely. No, I just wanted to reiterate what the board needs to do. And then I was gonna go right now to sort of pull out some of the things that were mentioned several times. Well, that would be fine. I just wanted to make sure that we didn't rush pie. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. So there were a lot of concerns specifically about the parking and how the parking would work, both in terms of how it would be accommodated on the site and how it could be navigated by one or two vehicles. There were concerns about the preservation of the easement and how that would be achieved. There were a lot of concerns that sort of about the process, how we got to this point, various things about communication, sort of keeping everyone informed and things like that, that were brought forward. And then there were also towards the end, a couple of concerns regarding sort of the appearance of the building in regards to its historic character, the historic character of the neighborhood and the proximity of the houses and sort of how that proximity can cause issues in regards to privacy and views and the like. So I believe those were the main things that were brought up. And with that, Mr. Hanlon, I would ask you if you're. So I wonder if we could put up the plan that shows where the parking is or will be or both. Let's cycle through my plans here. Here's one. So on this, this is from the application that was submitted to the Conservation Commission. And currently this is the portion here that's identified as existing parking. Is it possible to increase the scale here so that we can see that, focus in on that particular area? Sure. Not 100% exactly what is in your view, but let me. That better? Okay, that helps. And so what I would like, it doesn't help nearly as much as one of the exhibits that one of the applicants put in, which made it bigger, but you can sort of see where this is. And I wonder if Ms. Aikenhead could show how this fits in with the neighbor, where specifically any shared aspect of this parking is located and exactly where the extra, as I understand it from the material submitted to the Conservation Commission, the idea is to increase the width of this by two feet. And I would like her to show us where that would be. Essentially outline for us what the actual driveway will look like after it has been enlarged using this as a template. You can do that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 397</summary>

> So basically we don't have like a lot of leeway or play down here. The parking right now is fairly close to John and Sabrina's next door. What we wanted to do, because it is very tight as they pointed out time and time again, was in so far as it's relatively level, is just straighten this out a bit against our house and on the far side of everybody else's property, just to make it a tad bit wider and a little bit easier to get in and out of. We can right now park, the easement that the 216 has to get to the pond is here. We can pull two cars in here already and be off the east. Excuse me, Ms. Aikenhead, when you say here, at least I'm not seeing any, oh. Yep. So this is- I saw a little arrow, but I don't. Okay. I think I have to share my screen to do it. That would be fine with me. So let me go ahead and stop my sharing here. All right, go ahead. Now I have to zoom in. Can you see that? Is it big enough? No. Okay. So in the upper left there, there's a zoom percentage too on the- Oh yeah, okay. Would you do like 200? Yeah. Is that good? Yeah. Okay. 200? Yeah. Is that good? A little more. Okay. So this is- Can you see my arrow now? Yes. Okay, so this is the existing parking area. Pretty much goes along the property line right here. It's very tight. It is difficult to maneuver, though it's possible. So what our idea was to just make it, we can't go too far because the land drops off, but to widen it out on this side, which is away from the neighbors and to straighten it out a bit over here, which is by our house to add some extra maneuverability. This right here is the easement footpath that 216 has to pass every pass on foot. We are already able to pull two cars in here and be out of their way. But if we had a little bit more space, it would be a little bit easier. We do understand that the easement is legally binding and we are not going to interfere with that in any way because of course we cannot.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 273</summary>

> Okay, thank you. Mr. Chairman, we have the sort of disadvantage that the record in this case is just for this case and it doesn't include some of the other things that we know from the other case. And I think that I just like to observe that what we learned when we went to the walkthrough also included issues that I think are continue to be important in which I think everybody is assuming that we'll keep in mind. One of those has to do with constructability. It's a tight fit in there and it's a little difficult to get larger trucks through. And I think that maybe Mr. Ricardelli or others remarked on that. And certainly it is true that one of the issues that is not being talked about a great deal, but which matters I think a lot in the overall scheme of things is the effect that the building will have on the view particularly of Mr. Garber's property, but maybe the views of the lake with respect to some others. And those are issues that are actually issues in the case. We haven't heard as much about them in this hearing, but we heard quite a lot about them in hearings on the previous application. And if Mr. Cunningham approves of this, but I'd like to sort of incorporate by reference the material that were submitted in the other case and the testimony so that we're not forced to try to figure out when we wanna rely on something, which is the occasion on which we heard it. Mr. Cunningham, is that an appropriate thing to do?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 83</summary>

> As long as I think Mr. Chair. Please. Michael Cunningham, Acting Town Council. I think Mr. Hanlon's suggestion would certainly be helpful as long as those materials were at least at a later point made part of the record. Yes, I think I'm only referring to the things that were actually part of the record in that earlier case. And I think that would be helpful for the board. I believe Mr. Hanlon's suggestion is a good one and is permissible, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 224</summary>

> Thank you. So if I guess we may have to sort of make sure we have consent that we do that, but I do think that it's important to keep much of that in mind because we've talked a lot about the process and obviously people have proceeded in this case in a way in which has not certainly calmed everyone's nerves but when it comes down to it, there are some specific things that pose difficulties here. And I just mentioned some of them. One of the things I'd like to also ask Ms. Aikenhead about, we've had a lot of back and forth about stories and the magically disappearing story. And of course that's not magically disappearing because of any magic that anyone of any age manages to make real life stuff go away. It has to do with the peculiarities of the way in which our law is written. And in some ways, the impact, the physical impact that this will have on visibility and on the neighborhood in general here is likely to have to do with the actual height in feet rather than the height in stories. And I wonder if Ms. Aikenhead could comment on that. How tall is this compared to what it was required and in view of its location with respect to the neighboring properties?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 196</summary>

> Okay, so our roof line is 26 feet, I think one inch, which is nine feet below the maximum 35 foot that's allowed by right. Significantly lower than it's allowed by right. It's probably roughly equal to John and Sabrina's property. I don't know exactly because I haven't measured that. The thing about the stories, like if the basement was considered a story, like that number did magically appear and it did magically disappear, we can have two and a half stories by right. So we can still have a half story on the second floor. And a half story isn't defined as half height. It's defined as half of the square footage above the floor below being seven feet tall or lower. So in reality, if. the board concludes that it is a story in the basement, which I don't think it is, but that's okay. We can still have two and a half stories. I think the view to the neighbors isn't going to change because we just have to reconfigure the second floor a little bit to reduce the size so there's only 50% of the floor below at seven feet or higher.

> So, Mr. Chairman, the reason I raise this is I'm not too concerned. I mean, it seems to me that I've seen or heard no reason to doubt the way in which Inspectional Services has treated the heightened stories. I just think that heightened stories is not the right thing to be looking at when you're looking at the actual impact on the neighborhood. It's something that would have been very important to us if that story hadn't disappeared, we would have had a proposal for a new nonconformity that would have made this a much different case, but it isn't that. But it does involve a question of neighborhoods. Now, one of the things I think that the board ought to remember is that the reason why it is that we have, at least in my view, the reason why it is the way we have a special provision for large additions is the possibility that by proceeding to do things that a homeowner has the right to do, it could be in a situation where everything is built out, have an unfair and unreasonable impact on neighbors. And so you're looking particularly at the butters and what those impacts would be. And they have an importance that even is more important, I think, than it has in a normal case, because it is figuring out the reasonableness of whether a proposal is in a fairly narrow scope that we're asked to look at. We'll be asked to look at the general neighborhood in the community when we do 3.3.3, but the special things about the large addition have to do with the way in which buildings in close proximity may affect one another. And so it's, I think, important to both understand that the story that this is not that high, but it is high enough to actually interfere with you. And I don't think that there's any dispute that some interference is likely to take place, at least with respect to the Garber property and perhaps with respect to others. So I'm going to stop monopolizing people's attention right now, but I do think that it's important to focus in on the way in which this will fit into the neighborhood and the degree to which others in the neighborhood will be adversely affected by some of the things that Ms. Aikenhead would otherwise have had a right to do, but she doesn't have a right to do if she needs a special permit.

> All right, thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Are there other members of the board who have comments or questions?  Mr. Chair. Ms. Hoffman. Yeah, I just want to pick up the sort of last bit of what Mr. Hanlon was saying, specifically with regards to views, because it does seem clear that there's some impact to the views on the certain adjacent properties, but I think there's kind of an active question in my mind about what degree of impact is reasonable, and it's not as if there are clearly protected view rights here. So I'm curious to hear from other members of the board exactly how to assess that impact. Great, thank you. Go ahead, I'm just going to stop the share here so I can see more of the screen. Are there other members of the board who wish to... Yes, questions, okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 163</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Riccobelli. I do have a question regarding the retaining walls. So I just want to make sure that I'm sort of understanding the extent of the retaining walls. I think if I could ask the applicant, Mr. Chair, that there was a retaining wall shown on the original plan that kind of comes off the house, and in the floor plans of the basement, it says to rebuild that retaining wall. I think on the plot plan that we just looked at with the purple lines, there's an additional retaining wall that's sort of on the lake side of the house as well. So are there two tiers of retaining walls and if you could just explain, Ms. Aikenhead, what the construction, I think you showed a section of what one of those was, but if you could just explain what those two walls are, I think it would be helpful for me in understanding the grading on the site.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 194</summary>

> Sure, I can do that. If you want, I can reshare my screen, but basically right now, the back of the house has a foundation that then turns into a retaining wall where the house ends. So that will be new foundation. And then that wall turns, so if you're in the back of the house and you're going left towards the easement, oh, okay, let me just, yeah, there we go. Oh, so right now, this is the back of the, except for Christian, maybe you can show them, yeah. Yeah, so this is the existing retaining wall that- Correct, and they're all linked together. But the back of the house where the addition is will turn into foundation. I don't know if we'll need the extension to go out to where the wall turns, but that wall that turns is the one that's being undermined by those cinder block steps. There's a huge drop-off. We have to rebuild that because we have to have something there. It's not a new wall, it's going to be rebuilt. The level might have to change a little bit, but it will need to be redone.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 57</summary>

> So, Mr. Chair, if I may. Yeah, please. So that top foundation wall, so a portion of that will now be the foundation of the house. So I'm assuming a concrete or a structured wall there, and then the rest will be potentially a concrete wall as well, or would it also now be a block wall?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 147</summary>

> So, okay, so the wall, but that's behind the house right now is concrete. It's about five feet tall. It goes from the place that says proposed to a two-story addition over to the easement. That's concrete already. Some of it will be replaced by foundation. Some of it will still be retaining wall. Then where it turns, it will be probably concrete, but it could be anything really. The additional retaining wall that's two or three feet high is out at the edge where the purple lines are. So that is new to bring up the grade so that there can be a patio back there, which the Conservation Commission approved, and so that we can have footings for the deck. That is a new wall, but it's low and it's porous, and we propose a gabion wall, but it could be something similar to that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli, Christian Klein and Nellie Aikenhead - 518</summary>

> Okay. Okay, that's very helpful. I think that just understanding how those two things are interacting was sort of confusing to me. I think on one of the floor plans for the, I think, the basement of the proposed, the extent of that wall looks different than the overall site plan, and I was wondering if that was being cut back or reduced in order to get the parking in, or if that is maybe just a- Oh, no, no, that's way behind the house. So show me where it is. Yeah, so the one that the chair just pulled up on the screen, the extent of that wall just looks a little different, but maybe that's just because the addition comes out much further. Oh, you're talking about to the right of the house or in the back? This leg here on the- So I don't know for sure. Like, there is a wall there. It's not exactly that shape. I think that's kind of a rough rendering as opposed to an accurate display because the wall in the survey has a little bit of a kink in it. It's not straight. There will be something pretty much like that pretty much out there. It depends on how we're going to deal with the steps and the erosion and the change in grade that's there. The back wall, the back of the house, that's going to stay the same. We can't go any further into the resource area than we already are. So that wall will be in the exact same place. Okay, thank you, Mr. Chair. You're welcome. So is there sort of a final set of landscape plans that show the entire proposal, including the revised parking area, the location of all the retaining walls, the location of the house, the front steps, and all that? Is there a prepared plan that includes all that information, Ms. Aikenhead? No, there isn't. I have a land management plan that shows the vegetation and the plantings in the back, the patios and all, but it's more of a rendering than an exact plan. There's not a whole lot of play to move where the parking is. As I said, we're going to straighten it out. It's going to be there. We can't go any further because it drops off and we're not going down to the drop-off, but we haven't drawn it all out in a plan. Because in this plan here, the parking we know is somewhere in this area, but it's not well-defined. And we know that there's a landing and steps somewhere in this area that's similarly not well-defined. Right, I mean, you might, if you go down to the architect's plan, you can see where that stuff is, but I didn't. Yeah, I mean, unfortunately, there are several aspects of this and some of them that seem to be fairly critical to the plan itself and the functionality that are missing from the plan at this point. Right. I just wanted to confirm that I wasn't looking in the wrong place. No. Okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 113</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? We can have things added, I guess. In my mind, everything's going to be on our property within a foot of where it is now. We're not going on the abutters. We're not going on the easement. We're not going against the Conservation Commission. We're not going against the Historic District Commission, but moving earth around in this type of space, it's really, we could draw up a plan and have it be exact to the inch, but it might, in reality, it's probably not going to turn out that way because it's very complicated to do it ahead of time as opposed to working with what's there as we build.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 156</summary>

> Yeah. No, it's just, it's hard to assess exactly where the parking is. Is there sufficient space clear of the easement? And trying to get an understanding of sort of how the vehicles would move. I mean, there's sufficient space clear of the easement now. So when we make it bigger, it's only going to be better. We have had two cars down there many times in and out. And then this retaining wall, the one that has the jog in it over by the easement, that can't go any further than the easement because the easement's the easement and we can't interfere with that. So we have like, what, a foot there to play around with. Maybe, that's it. We know we can't interfere with that easement. We know we can't do anything on anybody else's property. We can, I mean, we could draw it all out, but. Mr. Handler, I believe you have, yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Handler? - 358</summary>

> Yeah, I would like to, just from the point of view of what happens, suppose this is approved, it will be approved subject to a condition that requires the plan that's executed to be consistent with the, or be the plan that is before the board. And we're in a situation where we have no one plan that shows that. We have testimony that indicates where something may be, but that's not the same thing that you can present to ISD and say, okay, this is what was on the proposed plan. And at the very least, I think we need to have something put together that is unambiguously what the proposed plan is. That doesn't have to be all one piece of paper. You could say, there's a landscape plan and that counts too. And you could conceivably incorporate by reference some part of plans that were before the conservation commission or pull them out. But either way, at the end of the day, you have to have something that's unambiguous so that the inspector can decide whether or not what's being proposed is consistent with what was approved. And that's difficult to do if you have to look at lots of different places. And if you have to sort of imagine as we do with the parking exactly where that would go. And I would say that it's true from Ms. Aikenhead's point of view that what they already have works for two cars, but it isn't equally true from Mr. Garber's point of view that it works for two cars. And there's testimony that the current situation has caused some inconvenience in the neighborhood as well. And we have to take all that into account. So it is certainly would be helpful to understand the way in which the expansion of the parking space might alleviate the difficulty that Mr. Garber and others have observed. It would also be helpful. I can't tell, is this dash line the easement? I hope this is. Ms. Aikenhead, is this the edge of the easement, this dash line around the plan? You're muting. Oh, no, you're on mute.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 136</summary>

> Sorry. Okay, so that dash line is the easement. That's the easement for the 216 to pass and repass on foot. You can see if you go towards the pond, our property jogs in by six feet. Yeah. And then after that, there's an easement for 216 to pass and repass, but it's on 218's property. Okay. And we have an easement ourselves onto 218's property beyond our own property by six feet. So see how there's that dotted line? If you go to the corner of our property, just to the right of 60.5, yes, there. We have six additional feet going into 218's land to drive, pass and repass and park our cars. It's bigger than it seems. That whole width is accessible to us for all purposes that all roads are used for.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 41</summary>

> Right, but you would not be able to, you wouldn't be able to, obviously you wouldn't be able to park there or park in the easement, but you have that, you're saying you have that for maneuverable space in order to-
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead and Others - 186</summary>

> Right, exactly. Exactly. And it's right now, so there's a 12 foot wide easement. So some of that is on our land. When you cross over, it's on John Garber's land. And so there's, see that thing that says 12 foot wide waterway? Half of that is on 218's land. Half of that is on 214 land. It's our right to pass and repass. Right now, about eight feet of that is paved. So there's an additional four feet that we have access to that is not currently paved. Okay. So like we can maneuver with an eight foot thing and we're fine with it. But if the neighbors start making a fuss about how dangerous it is, we can widen it out to our full 12 feet so that we cut the danger. Is this portion of the plan here is, this is an actual roadway, correct? No, that is also labeled right-of-way, which to me looks like it benefited our property at some point in time, but we have not pursued that. It's underneath their deck right now. Ah, okay, I see. Mr. Terman.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 28</summary>

> Mr. DuPont. So I have a couple of questions as well. Do we have a front view from the front going down to the lake or the pond?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead and Others - 111</summary>

> I have a front elevation. Oh, if you do, then I will stop sharing. I can share my screen. I'll ask you to put that up. I'm going to have a lot of views, but. Might have to, is this far enough away or did you want further back? I was really looking to see what it looked like from the Garber's property, if there's a view. So, yeah, I can back up. I have to get a different photo out. This is like started right here is the edge of the Garber's property. This I think is the property line, the blue line, and this is the street going down.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 780</summary>

> Because if I may, Mr. Terman, when we visited, I remember standing on the Garber's deck and asking the question about what was proposed at the time where it was going to extend upward and how far to the side to the right as we were standing on the deck. And I remember Ms. Aiken had saying what it was going to be, the dimensions, I don't recall what they were, but I was trying to visualize it in terms of what the visual impact would be. And as Ms. Hoffman had alluded to, there's no specific view easement in our bylaw. So it sort of gets carried over into the questions I suppose about whether or not the structure's in harmony with the rest of the neighborhood, et cetera. But I guess my question is, if Ms. Aikenhead can recall what the dimensions were at the time that we visited, what is the addition going upward on that right-hand side going to look like in terms of how much higher it's gonna go than the existing roof line? You know, how much farther out it's gonna go to the right as you're viewing it from the front? So that I'm really asking for a comparison between what's being proposed now and what was being proposed then. Because I had an idea, a very vague idea, quite frankly, of what it would look like if I was standing on the Garber's deck. Right, so in terms of going from this corner right here out to the right, the addition is about five feet. So most of the addition, there's an L behind the house right here. The vast majority of the addition is behind that L. So first floor level wouldn't be seen. If it goes out to about here, because their porch is kind of over here, it's a tangential view. So I don't think they would see the first floor too much. The second floor will be new and higher. So that would be visible. And so there was a comment made, Mr. Chairman, about, you know, in the event, and by the way, I think that the work that's been done with regard to what's a story and what's not a story has been, is fairly definitive, you know, according to the calculations that have been made, that have been revised, that have been reviewed by the town. So for purposes of discussion, I think that it is not a story down there. However, I know Ms. Aiken had made the reference to the fact that even if it were a story, that she'd be entitled to build a half story where she was proposing to build upward and that she'd have to keep it to, you know, under 50% of the floor below. And it couldn't, if only 50% could be seven feet or above. So I'm just wondering if that was built rather than what you're proposing, what would the difference be in terms of the square footage on that level? Do you know? If you understand my question. Can you say that again? Yeah, so I think you had said that even if the basement was considered a story, that you could still go up a half story. And so, you know, because of the requirements for 50% and seven feet, all of that, I'm wondering, because you've got 930 square feet that you're talking about, right? For this, as is proposed, how much different would it be if that top level was just built as a half story based upon that calculation? Okay, so if you know. These are rough numbers, but like right now, the proposed first floor, I believe is 1175. So let's just say it's 1200, right? 50% of that would be 600. That means 50% of this second floor, 600 square feet could be seven feet tall or higher. So the rest of it has to have enough of a slope so that it's under seven feet. So the other 600 has to be under seven feet. Right now, because we have a cathedral ceiling dining room, we have 999 feet. So somehow we'd have to get rid of 399 feet, which we could do by stepping it all back and doing, for example, a roof deck on the pond side. All right, I was just trying to get- My point is like, first of all, well, I want to get into this. We haven't tried to compromise because we have, but if we had to do that, it wouldn't make one bit of difference to the neighbors in terms of height of the building, views or anything else.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 95</summary>

> Okay, thank you. And I did, I think I pulled up my, I pulled up my historic district commission. There's an interesting, I have to just find it, but I have a little indicator that shows how high, how much higher our roof is going, which is about 10 feet relative to the garbage, if I can find it. Okay. Actually, I know where it is, I know where it's at. Okay. I mean, the historic district commission is a pretty picky bunch. They did analyze the scale and massing of this house pretty extensively.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 19</summary>

> Okay. You can, I don't want to hold you up, so you can do something else while I'm looking.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 99</summary>

> This is just an indicator from the street. That's the garbage. This is Shaw and Abraham's. This is the 216 Pleasant Street. Our house is below this. And we had to put a, we put a pole up on the roof to show where the roof line was going to be. And it's somewhere like just barely visible from these trees. So it's lower than their house still, but it's higher than it is now. Whatever you just described, we do not see. I know, we can't see it because I've got to find the right picture. Oh, okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 15</summary>

> Sorry. Mr. Dupont, did you have further questions? No, that wasit. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sarah Radigan - 255</summary>

> Yes, we- I apologize for interjecting. I was hoping to be acknowledged just very briefly. My name is Sarah Radigan. I'm the attorney for John Garber and Sabrina Howe. You are aware that we had a public comment period earlier this evening? I do. And I just wanted to interject briefly to ask if the board would like to see either a photo or video that my clients do have that will show you at least things, obviously the existing view from their property line. The various board members' questions about the impact from their property have seemed to be important. And I was going to ask that one, if they were able to share the photographs or video, that would be helpful. And two, to request that if this board is going to request additional information from the petitioners, that it would be very helpful to our clients to see a view rendering, not fancy, it doesn't have to be super fancy, but something that would show what the impact would be from the perspective of the neighboring lot. And this is really due to the fact that the massing of that second floor structure is right nine feet from the front property line. So contrary to what Ms. Aiken had was suggesting, which is a smaller second floor addition that could be stepped back would make no difference to my clients, one that I would entirely disagree. And that might be just the type of compromise that might be possible. Okay, let me-
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 21</summary>

> Thank you. Thank you. So members of the board, would you like to see those additional images? Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 81</summary>

> I think it would be helpful. One of the big issues in this case is going to be the impact this has on the neighboring properties, which in part, in large part is going to have to do with visibility. And the one thing that we don't really have, we plot plans won't tell you that. And understanding better than our memory of the walkthrough that we did last spring would be a little helpful in having that in our minds.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead? - 103</summary>

> Can I just say one thing? I found the pictures I wanted to share with you. Okay, if you could go ahead and share that. The red line. So currently we're seeing the image you had before, which is the driveway with the red arrow and the blue line. Oh, I don't want that. Chart A, visibility. It's not changed over. Okay, well, I'm seeing it. You can stop this share. Stop it and then start a new one. Yeah. So unshare this. If you click on share screen. Okay. Oh yeah, okay. And then you should be able to pick something different.

<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 73</summary>

> But I'd like to recognize Mr. Cunningham. You had your hand raised. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to note that although public comment period has closed, the chair has broad discretion. And to the extent that there is something that the board would like to see and the chair would allow the board to see that, that would be permitted. But just a reminder that the public comment period has closed.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 4</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>	 Nellie Aikenhead - 172</summary>

> Okay, can you see my screen now? Can. You can? Yep. Okay, good. So see this little red line? Yep. This is the future height of the roof. The highest, the absolute highest point. The Historic District Commission asked us to do this for them. So we went up, we measured up the roof height and we put a thing where we marked it. So here we are. This is our future roof line. This is Sabrina and John's house. And here's our future roof line. And here is their house. This is the highest point of the roof, not the lowest point. This is if you're looking from way up at the corner, you can see that you're going to slightly almost be able to see our top roof line. And same here. This is from the pond side. It's going to go up. Yeah. That is helpful, thank you. I could go ahead and have you stop sharing. And then Ms. Radigan, did you have the images that you referenced?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sarah Radigan - 428</summary>

> I'm sorry, I don't, but John and Sabrina. I have just two very short clips, I think. If they'd be helpful, I could share my screen. Yeah, so Ms. Raulston, if you could give John Garber the ability to share screen. Okay, you should have permission now to share. Okay, great. Let's see here. This, I think, can everyone see like a video of a deck there? Yep. Okay, this is a view from our, actually from inside our house, in from our living room, essentially. And you can sort of see the deck doors are open. Yeah. And this is another video. These are all very short. There's three. This is another video of just from the property line, just showing the proximity. Let me put a stake. And that's the flag there. I think we still see the same image. Oh, sorry. Give me one second. Sorry about that. No, no, take your time. I think this is a view from the, sorry, I'll restart. There we go. This is a view from the property line. You can see a stake there. So there's nine feet. I believe at the start of that video, you could see more around the corner where the parking is. Correct. Okay, yeah. It doesn't turn anymore to the right. Doesn't, no. No, it doesn't. Okay. And then I think just to share, just one final one, equally short. This is just from, you know, inside our, is this the right one, Serena? Okay, yeah, this is from inside our living room. Again, just showing kind of what the current existing is and what we would be looking at to add 10 feet on top of that. Yep. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. If, when you look at that last picture, there's a chimney that's sort of coming up. And I imagine the 10 feet is a bit higher than that chimney. I believe that chimney is the one that the pole with the red tag on it that Ms. Aiken had showed earlier. I think it's that chimney. Yeah. So you get a sense if you look, if you sort of imagine that something a little higher, you get a sense of what you can't see, what you can see now, and you wouldn't be able to see if the addition went up even that level, that 10 feet level. Yeah. Okay. I mean, it's not 10 feet above the top of the roof because the ceiling upstairs is nine feet. So it's 10 feet above the bottom of the roof.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 181</summary>

> Yeah. Okay. And my thanks to Mr. Garber for sharing those images. So going back to the board. So it sounds like there's still some questions that the board has at this stage that we need to try to resolve. And per Mr. Hanlon's comments earlier, I'm not sure we have all the information in a format that we would need not only to render a determination, but also to then be able to verify that the terms of whatever decision is made are being followed if the project were approved and to move forward. So from what I've heard from the board at this time, that the site plan really needs to be inclusive. It needs to show where the proposed parking is really going to be. It should include the front entrance, which is now going to be relocated to the left side, but that with the entry stairs for that and confirmation just on the location of the retaining walls, just to make sure we have that understood. And was there other information that the board was seeking?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 71</summary>

> I mean, it would be helpful, I think, to understand the turning radiuses for the vehicles, but I'm not entirely sure that that's, that's something that we have not requested in the past for a residential project of this scale. We've certainly done so for comprehensive permits, but not for something of this small scale. But I don't know if that's something that the board would find helpful for its deliberations.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 273</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. Dupont. So I think something that at least gives us the information, I'm not sure how formal it would have to be. I think that, you know, if we have a clear delineation of where the parking is, then I think that you can get a feel yourself. I mean, if other members feel they want something that's more scientific, that's fine. But I'd like to go back to, it's a part of this that's critical for me is, you know, if I'm looking at the view from the garbage deck, which I believe is what the clips were that we were just viewing, although from inside the house, even though there's no such thing as a view easement in our bylaw. So I think though, it would be important from my understanding to see essentially what that view would look like. If you were on the garbage deck or at least from the front so that we could get a sense as to where the roof is going to be extended if you're viewing it from the house, because as Mr. Hanlon said, you can see what you can see and can't see from the garbage deck where it currently, as it's currently constructed. But Ms. Aiken had said, and I want to make sure I understand this, that the 10 feet is not from the top of the roof, it's from the bottom. Is that from the bottom of the shingles, the bottom of the roof, as you're looking at it from the front, it would go up 10 feet from that point? Is that what we're saying?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont and Nellie Aikenhead - 249</summary>

> Yes, approximately, because the first floor height is established already and then there's a hip roof that goes up, but the second floor is going to sit on top of the first floor and it has a flat roof. So I believe the ceilings are nine feet and you need some framing. So it's probably 10 feet. Correct. Oh, okay. So this is the current top of the first floor. This door is in the same place. I see. And this is the top. Yeah, so this is essentially- So the hip roof probably goes to here right now, roughly. The current roof. I don't know who has control there, but could somebody show me where? So the pitched roof probably comes to about this. Yes, I agree. But where's the top of the existing roof right now? So that would be the top of the existing roof, would be about here. Okay. And so the new part that's built in the front is going to be a couple of feet higher. Correct. And then in the back, is it true that then the total height, if you're looking at the front as it exists now is going to be that 10 feet higher? Is that what that sort of- The back part. See, yeah, there you go. The back part, which is now on the right-hand side, is the highest part. That's the 26 feet height versus the allowable 35. The front is a little bit stepped down.

> I will say that we- We have met with the Garbers once with their attorney and twice otherwise to say, what can we do to make this better? Can we take a foot off the roof? Can we make some adjustments? And their answer across the board has been, do nothing. We will support nothing. You can build out your basement. So if they want to propose something, we are so happy to listen. Chairman Klein, could you just, on that picture that you have, would you go back and show me where in the front, you had just showed me where the roof line was existing on the front of the... Yeah. So if we're going to the side view, then that would be approximately in this position. Got it. Okay. So the distance above that is not 10 feet. No, it's more 10 feet above this line here for the second floor. Right. But I'm trying to figure visually from say the Garbers property, it's going to be not a full 10 feet above what exists now. No, not above what exists now. All right. That's... Sorry to interrupt, but there's an elevation. There's an elevation later on in this set that shows the existing ridge height of the roof from the first floor level. So you can get a sense of that. And I believe it's about eight feet difference. To the new high point of the roof to the existing. Do you remember which sheet number that was? It should be page 20 on the PDF. Okay. Ah, thank you. Yeah. So they have that 12 foot three and a half from the first floor to the top of the ridge. So if you do the math for the high point of the roof is, of the proposed is 20 foot 11 and three quarters from the first floor height. So difference of, you know, eight feet and change. But you have to double check and make sure this is from average grade because that 26 is from average grade and that looks like... Yeah, it's 20 foot and 11 three quarters from first floor, which is the same dimension that that 12 foot 11 and three quarters, whatever is measured from. Well, that's in first floor, but the 26 is from average grade, which is lower. Yeah, I'm just, I'm talking about the 20 foot 11 and three quarters is measured from first floor. Right, but the 26 is from average grade. So it's not necessarily an eight foot differential. There is another diagram in here somewhere that... Yeah, but it's visually, it's a eight foot differential of what the existing roof height is to the proposed. So it's just trying to answer Mr. DuPont's kind of thing of how much higher is this new roof than the existing. Thank you.

</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 621</summary>

> Chairman, could I just, one of the things that I'm sure Ms. Aikenhead is noticing is that, I mean, we have been focusing on the impact on this little neighborhood, which does raise some special considerations. And I at least think we're all trying to be sensitive to what the impact is. This house is probably, I think, now the smallest of the houses of the group. It is not going to turn into a McMansion. It's not what the design guidelines were concerned about. Those are the five and 6,000 square feet houses that are cropping up in other parts of town. But still, this is the environment it is, which is all tight together and where a little bit of activity on one house affects the others. I just want to emphasize that what we have not talked about is all the things that was talked about before the Conservation Commission. There are a lot, a lot of things that are in the public interest that are being done in connection with this development. In terms of the effect on Spy Pond, in terms of the effect on erosion and wildlife and all of the kinds of things that the Conservation Commission is concerned with, this is like to make a big improvement. And that improvement won't be just enjoyed by this property, but everybody else who's enjoying this bit of the lake. And I think we shouldn't forget that. And in some ways, that's what is making this case seem so difficult for me, because there is a lot of good in it. And it isn't just a nuisance to everybody. And it isn't like building a big mansion someplace where you'd rather not have it. This is a situation in which there's a lot on the good side and in which, nevertheless, there is an impact, I think, on the surrounding neighborhood that we have to decide something about how reasonable that is. And I must say, I'm very disappointed that, and I do not want to listen to any other discussion about who it is who is willing to talk to whom when. The fact is that nobody seems to have been willing to talk at the same time, so there was never a conversation. I think that just in order to be able to put this in order so we have something that is structured that we can properly vote on it is going to take a little bit of time. But I can certainly say that if both sides should decide that now is the time to talk, and to talk seriously about making accommodations that could soften this degree of, that could soften the impact that the house is certainly going to have on the neighborhood, that it would certainly make our job a lot easier when we try to figure out what to do with it. The way this is going, there's going to be winners and losers, and I don't really want anyone to be a winner and loser necessarily if it's possible to come up with something that if it's not perfect is still something that is an appropriate compromise on both sides. So there's a little bit of opening left for serious conversation. I don't want to actually, if it doesn't happen, we're going to do our job and we're going to do the balance that we can. And I don't think anybody can predict what we'll do, I certainly can't, and I can't predict what I will do. So there's some room for trying to do a little private ordering rather than take your chances with well-meaning but not perfect members of the public body like this one.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 347</summary>

> Well, thank you, Mr. Hanlon. So if we could focus on what additional information the board would like to have before it renders this decision, we can pass that along to the applicants, the applicant is aware, and then for your very well-taken statement, there is still a small opening to see if there's a way to come to some kind of an agreement that's a little bit more in keeping with everybody. I understand, we've certainly heard that there has been an effort to try to get some compromise, but it has not proceeded very well. And hopefully there is an opportunity and a way to make that work, because otherwise, as Mr. Hanlon said, the board is just going to have to render a decision. I think we've talked about the site plan and what we would like to see better delineated on the site plan, we want it to be more, everything that's going to be on that site, we want to see it so we know exactly where it's going. If there are any changes to the plans, so right now these elevations are out of sync with the, my understanding is at least these are out of sync now with where the retaining wall is in terms of where the patio height is and things like that. So we just want to make sure that that's all taken care of and cleaned up so that the drawings we're looking at are accurate, that they're coordinated and accurate. I think it would also be helpful if we did have a plan, if we'd had, like on the proposed north elevation, if it was dashed in sort of where the outline of the existing house, if we could have a set of plans of that, it should be very simple for the architect to do, but it would give us a good visual of how to compare what we're seeing before and after. So that's a little bit more clearly delineated for us. Are there other things that the board would want to request?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 140</summary>

> Mr. Chair? Mr. Riccobelli? Just to build off what you said, I'm most concerned about just seeing a coordinated site plan with all the elements on it, just so we know, you know, both the locations of the retaining walls that we talked about, but also the extents of those walls. And I know, Ms. Aiken, that you mentioned that things with grading get difficult, but this is a projection for you because this is the plan that we can approve, but it's also a check for the neighbors so that they know exactly what they're getting if this were to be approved. So I think that's critical, and especially the parking area and the dimensions of that parking area so we can evaluate, you know, the best we can, whether that can accommodate the cars that it's supposed to.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 182</summary>

> Mr. Chairman?  Mr. Hanlon? A few minutes ago, there was a discussion that was talking about turning radiuses and so forth, and I'm not sure that that came to a conclusion. Again, I'm not, as is true of others, I'm not particularly wedded to any particular way of doing that, but having some visual way for us to make an independent judgment of the very different views the applicant and some of the neighbors have on how functional the proposed parking will be and whether or not you can actually use what you have there without backing up and then going into a neighbor's driveway. It would be useful just to be able to see that so that we can make up our minds, because the applicant and the neighbors have a totally different view of the reality on that, and we're going to have to choose what we think is right, and I don't, at this point, want to make that based on credibility. I'd like to have at least some evidence that enables us to form an independent judgment.

<details><summary>	 Adam LeBlanc - 83</summary>

> Mr. Chair? Yes, Mr. LeBlanc. Just to go off Mr. Hanlon's point, I think when we're talking about the parking, if we could at least get a couple of outlines of what a car looks like in the proposed parking area, I think that'll go a long way in helping us understand the maneuverability of a vehicle in the space. Nothing fancy, just a dashed outline of a typical vehicle size I think would be helpful and go a long way. Thank you.

> Anything further from the board? Okay. Then I am going to recommend that we continue this hearing. So we have a couple of dates coming up. So November 14th is effectively three weeks from now. And then we would also have that November 28th is two weeks after that. That is just after Thanksgiving, so it's not Thanksgiving week. And then we have December 12th. So those are the next three upcoming dates for the board. I would ask Ms. Aikenhead if she feels she could be ready for the 14th or would she prefer the 28th? I might possibly be able to be ready with the 14th, but there's a lot to pull together, so the 28th is probably safer. Okay. Okay. Appreciate that. With that, then I would entertain a motion to continue the special permit hearing for 212 Pleasant Street to a date certain of Tuesday, November 28th at 7.30 p.m. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. So moved. Second. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. So this is a motion to continue the special permit hearing for 212 Pleasant Street to a date certain of October 28th, 2023 at 7.30 p.m. as moved by Mr. Hanlon, seconded by Mr. DuPont. Vote of the board. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Hanlon. Aye. Mr. Hawley. Aye. Mr. Riccardelli. Aye. Ms. Hoffman. Aye. Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. The chair votes aye. We are continued on 212 Pleasant Street. Thank you all very much. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I just like the record to reflect that this board member at least would be particularly happy and thank and give a lot of thanks in the days after Thanksgiving, if what we have next time is a kumbaya moment rather than a three hour hearing. Thank you. I'll try. Thank you so much. Good night.

<details><summary>	 Erica Schwartz - 621</summary>

> Yes. Hello everyone. I am Erica Schwartz. I'm the executive director of the housing corporation of Arlington. And I am joined by Vickis NT. From reframe systems, a Somerville based company. So we are proposing to put an ADU, an accessory dwelling unit behind HCA is existing to family home. Which is located at 40 to 42 Dorothy road. Okay. So I will just quickly run through some, just a few views just to like orient you. And then Vickis can kind of get into the details of. The benefits of this. The benefits that we see for what we're proposing. So. Go ahead and give the Schwartz. Okay. All right. You should be all set now. Okay. So just a very few couple of slides. So. My first one was actually a pretty sort of start with our, all right. So you're seeing a map right now, right? Yeah, just, just to orient people. This is 40 to 42 Dorothy road. It's at the corner with Parker street. Which at least. You can see it. Sort of backs up to Thorndike field. An area that I believe regardless of, I haven't actually tracked what's happening with the. The proposal. Proposed for parts of that, but I think where we back up is an area that will remain woodsy regardless. So this is just a view on Dorothy road of our two family, which we're proposing to demolish. This is the view from that private way. And you can see this garage in the back, which we would plan to demolish our tenants. Our current tenants do not use it. And approximately in his, in its place, but a different shape sort of narrower, longer, a little taller. We'd be proposing to put the ADU, which would be a single unit of affordable housing. Into that wooded area. So I'll just say just a few words about why we're excited before turning it over. So normally HCA wouldn't be pursuing a single unit of affordable housing. But we're excited to do this because we are partnering with reframe and we're looking at a project that's going to be built in the future. And we're looking at a project that's going to be built in the future because they're piloting it with us. As well as some other communities. They also have a similar agreement. With the Somerville community corporation where they're going to. Pilot a triple Decker, but what they're proposing is a product. That's a modular unit, but it's sort of like the newest greatest modular units of today. Where it is a net zero all electric, but it's sort of like the newest greatest modular unit of today. And it's going to be a modular unit. Meant to be a cheaper alternative to traditional construction. So we're really excited. To place this single unit and create one more unit of affordable housing, but also we're just interested in seeing if this might be something we might want to use in the future for a multifamily development. So I, and I will just say one other thing, which is. You know, we've had a lot of conversations with the owner of the garage, which is here. Are a butter sort of across that private way. Who's the only other, a property owner that sort of you would regularly use that this, this part of the private way opposite our garage is another garage. To make sure that he's aware of what our plans are. And, and you know, we'd be coordinating on. You know, how to make sure that we're not disrupting any access to the driveway that's opposite hours. So I'll stop. Sharing. And turn it over to Vegas.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 725</summary>

> Hello everyone. My name is the cost. I'm the co-founder CEO of reframe systems. We're partnering with Erica and HCA to build this. Two-story ADU. From the perception. That we want to have a purpose that concerns businesses or services throughout the city. That's our focus. So, as Erika pointed out, wrong window, sorry. As Erika pointed out, we're replacing an existing garage with the two-story ADU. This is still a high-level schematic, we're still refining a lot of the details, but in the interest of time we wanted to get a couple of variances in play. So we've submitted a special permit request. The first thing is to get side-set-back variance, to place this unit will be within six feet of the property line in the back, to make sure that we can meet the appropriate size of the unit, and also create off-street parking for the primary, the principal dwelling. We end up in a situation where we'll end up placing the ADU on the property line at the back and will be within four feet to the left side. So that's the first variance we're requesting from the Zoning Board. The second thing we're requesting is a height variance. The by-right allows us to get up to 20 feet tall, we'll actually end up being, in our current version of the design, almost 23 feet. This is largely driven by two things. One we're, in an effort to make sure we're not disrupting topsoil and not increasing the use of concrete, we're choosing to go with helical piles as our foundation system. This ends up adding almost a foot in height. Because we're using prefabricated volumetric modules, we end up with some inefficiencies with height, which are not an issue for other zoning considerations. We're kind of heading up against a constraint here. A huge advantage of taking the volumetric approach, where we ship, where we prefabricate this entire structure in the factory and bring it over, is that the actual construction site is not really a construction site. It's a pretty quick install process, so very little disruption to neighbors. It's a really clean, quiet site, and also allows us to really be very quick. But to make this happen, we will need to request a height variance. And then the inspector flagged that we had to request for two additional variances as part of it. One was to create the driveway, because this is a corner lot, even though we're going to have the driveway created on the location of the existing garage, it was suggested that we request a variance to do that. So we're adding it here for documentation purposes. And lastly, we're still refining our floor plan, but we'd like to understand if there's an appetite to allow us to build an additional 108 square feet. That's where our current gross floor area is landing. A big chunk of this is due to the insulation requirements. We're trying to build to a passive house zero rating, which requires us to have about four inches of exterior continuous insulation. That adds about 67 square feet, and since there's no allowance to not treat exterior insulation separately from gross floor area, we're kind of impacted there. The second piece is because we're building this as an affordable rental unit, we're trying to comply with DHCD's requirements for minimum sizes for bedrooms. That's adding some additional 27 square feet for our bedroom on the second floor. And lastly, again, to meet passive house ratings, our mechanical room has to be increased in size to have an energy recovery ventilator. That's adding another 14 square feet. So this stack up is what's driving the delta from the 900 square feet cap to the 1,008 square feet. We believe these are all small changes given the unique location of the site. The fact that it's really not going to intrude that much on neighbors, and it's kind of tucked away in the back, we believe all of these variances are minor and don't really affect the character of the neighborhood. We would like to request your support in allowing us to realize building an affordable passive house zero ADU and having this serve as a blueprint for how we can partner with other community corporations to get more affordable housing out there.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 383</summary>

> Thank you very much for the presentation. So what we have before us in this application, so it's a special permit for the accessory dwelling unit in an accessory structure, and then there are three additional variances, because there's two that were published. But we are looking, so one would be for front yard parking. So we have the height variance and the site setback as part of special permit 23-1, and then the inspection department flagged that we create V23-1 to flag the floor area variance and the parking variance. Thank you. Yeah, so I had noted the height and the area before, but as you say, they are in a way sort of baked into the way that you do your construction and the way you design these units. Is there any, and you had specifically indicated how much of that area is really taken up by issues like insulation and minimum room sizes and the like. So when the accessory dwelling unit bylaw was passed by a town meeting a few years ago, it was a pretty contentious item in a lot of ways. And the 900 square feet was established to sort of keep ADUs from becoming too large and too prominent as they went forward and to really sort of keep them as a minor use on the site rather than a primary use. So I think that this is something that the board is going to have to talk about, but by greater sort of underlying concern is where this is a request for variance. The first variance criteria is looking for something that is unique about the site that basically would make it impossible to adhere to the requirements of the site. And what we have here is a flat rectangular site, which doesn't really have anything about it that would preclude following the bylaws, with the exception of the chosen method of construction. And so I think this is sort of the first thing that the board is going to have to really consider is, is this something that the board can consider for a variance, or does this not meet the requirements for a variance under state law? I would open that question to the board, so what their opinion is on that question.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 593</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. So, first I want to say I think it's a great looking concept and I'm very supportive of the idea in general of this type of construction, and I will admit though that what Mr. Klein has just outlined was also on my mind. So one question I have is, is this going to be set right on the lot line in the rear?  That's what the drawing currently shows. I think we have some opportunity for moving it by right up to a foot, but yeah, because I had a question about that and it's partly because I'm not entirely clear. I mean, I do think that, as Mr. Klein put it, it's really due to the nature of the materials and the construction that the, you know, that the dimensional requirements as far as the square footage and the height are being proposed to exceed what's currently allowed. And generally speaking, when we look at a variance, we say, well, it has to be some part of the land that is unique to this property, but having to do with topography, soil condition or lot shape. And I'm not sure, and I'm not saying I can't be persuaded, but I'm not sure I see that. And that also, it raised a question for me about, you know, we've had a lot of garages in the town that are sitting on the property line in the rear. So that's not anything that's unusual, but what is a little bit different here is that there's a proposal essentially to demolish the garage and to reconstruct a larger building. And I was trying to go through the zoning bylaw to see if there was anything in there that says that you can build something essentially from scratch, you know, that would be on the lot line. And there certainly are provisions to build a garage on the rear lot line. That's, you know, that's in there. And I just don't see, you know, unless the building department, inspectional services is saying, well, you know, we consider it to be a demolition. You know, a lot of times when there's demolition of an existing building, they require, and I don't know under which specific provision of the state building code that you leave up like 50% of what's existing in order to have it not be an entire demolition, but to be an addition. And, you know, the architects on the board can speak to that much better than I can, but I'm not entirely clear how we get around the fact that we're taking down a building and we're putting up a new building, which is clearly not a garage. And we're calling it an ADU, which to some extent shouldn't make a difference because we've looked at garages on the rear lot line, knowing that those are going to be converted completely to living space. And we haven't had a problem with that concept, but I still don't necessarily see how we get from demolishing an entire garage and not using it as part of the ADU and then putting in a brand new building, which is not a garage and then having it be an ADU and maybe other members of the board can help me out here because I'm stuck on that point before I even get to the square footage and the height and then of course the parking. So there's a lot sort of wrapped up here, even though generally I like the concept.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 805</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. Two things. I am like the chair, I think, and like Mr. DuPont, hung up on the notion of figuring out how this relates to soil typography or the shape of the lot. And that's not something that we can just wave and say, well, if it's a good idea. We have actually had within the last six months, several cases where what the applicant proposed to do was a really good idea, but because it violated, because it couldn't be justified on that basis, we had to say no, because that's what variance law requires us to do. I do have a difference of view with respect to whether you can tear down the garage. Obviously, you can convert a garage and you could probably add things to the garage so that you have an addition to, and that's all something that wouldn't pose any particular conceptual difficulty. But if the problem is demolishing the garage, then you have to sort of think, well, where, how does that stand? And I'd like to point out and look at the provision of the bylaw, because where would the six foot limit comes from is the accessory dwelling units. And what the bylaw says is an accessory dwelling unit may be located in an accessory building, which accessory building shall not constitute a principal or main building by the incorporation of the accessory dwelling unit, provided that if such accessory building is located within six feet of a lot line, then such accessory dwelling units shall be allowed only if the board of appeals grants a special permit on finding that the creation of such accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the use of the accessory building as a private garage or other allowed use. And it seemed to me that the authority to build something new is implicit in the language that is chosen by the accessory dwelling unit ordinance itself. It doesn't talk about garages particularly, although it clearly is thinking of garages as one possible use that would be a benchmark for considering what the accessory dwelling unit would be. But all the way through this, it talks about accessory buildings and it talks about them in a general way that doesn't limit it to a garage or any other particular kind of accessory building. I'm absolutely positive as somebody who worked with the folks who Tom Meading who brought this about, that they would be astonished at the notion that this only applied to garage conversions and didn't apply to other kinds of accessory buildings that were built new. Clearly you can have accessory dwelling units in new buildings. As a matter of fact, if it weren't within six feet of the lot line, then you wouldn't actually have to come to us at all. It would be buildable by right. If it is within six feet, then you can still do all the same things you could do if it wasn't. There isn't suddenly a requirement that this be a pre-existing garage that suddenly jumps up when you make it five and a half feet. You are basically still doing the same things you were before, but this time you have an additional criterion that comes into play. I've made this point on a couple of other occasions where it wasn't as pushed to the extent that it is here. But actually, I think that while the framers were certainly looking at all those garages that were on the property line, they chose to write and Tom Meading chose to accept a much more generally written bylaw that did not imagine that if you were within six feet of the lot line, you had to have a prior garage. I'm not too concerned about that. I am concerned, however, about in general meeting the requirements of the state law. I will also say that I'm very concerned about violating the 900 square foot limit. Again, as somebody who was part of the process that brought us this bylaw, that was very important in allaying the concerns of people who thought that the ADU bylaw would be an indirect way of allowing you to essentially turn a single family into a two-family house. You wanted to have some way of limiting that down. And I understand here that when you figure out why it is you need the extra space to accommodate in this particular kind of construction situation to accommodate Passive House Zero, it still is a really important part of the compromise that brought us the legislation that the limit was 900 square feet. I'm finding it very difficult to reconcile that underlying idea with the notion that that is variable by variance. That gives me a lot of pause.

<details><summary>	 Venket Holi? - 96</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Henty. Sorry, I was going to say that it's really helpful to hear. I think the place where we have the greatest flexibility is working hard to reduce the floor area. The site setback is something, obviously, we don't have much of a choice given the site constraints, and that's probably the one we'd like to focus the board's attention to. And then the second thing would be if there's any appetite for considering the height increase, and then we would try to manage the floor area to be within 900 square feet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Adam LeBlanc - 298</summary>

> Mr. Chair?  Mr. LeBlanc? I think at first when I saw this, I was a little unsure about the demoing of a garage and then putting up a new structure, kind of how Mr. DuPont laid out. But I think the more I've kind of looked at this, maybe I could be persuaded that it is something that's possible. But I think where I get hung up is the extra height and the extra square footage. Because when I look at this, it's a two-bedroom, two-bath unit, which I think is a pretty good unit. But I think it could be done as a one-bedroom or a studio and be within that 900 square feet and still be a successful thing. And that would get rid of both of those items as well, because you would get rid of the height increase. It would be something comparable to the height of the existing garage that's there. And then also still be, I'm assuming, having done the math, I'm assuming it would be well under the 900 square feet if we just do a single story thing. And also just going back to the other ADUs that we've seen so far come across the board, have either been one-bedrooms or studios that we've looked at that are going into existing garages. So I think because it's the square footage thing that gets you, it kind of restricts you to those levels. And obviously, as we can see, once you start to try and push the boundaries on that and get two bedrooms, you're really above that. So I think it'd be something that I'd be willing to. to consider if we saw it as a, you know, something that is conforming more to the height and floor area.

<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 153</summary>

> Thank you for that. Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. To be brief. So I'm persuaded by what Mr. Hanlon read from the accessory dwelling unit section. I do, however, wish that they had made some sort of a reference back to the fact that, you know, notwithstanding the provisions of the dimensional and density requirements, you know, where it says you've got a six foot rear yard, you know, setback or side yard, I suppose as well. I kind of wish they'd tied that up so that if you read it, you knew exactly that this that's in the chart doesn't apply to the accessory dwelling unit. So that's just an aside, but yeah, I think that it was well stated and I'm persuaded that it is doable to put it on the property line. And I think Mr. LeBlanc's points are also very well taken and I'm sort of in alignment with those.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Erica Schwartz - 62</summary>

> Thank you. In regards to the question about the parking. So is Parker Street private or public? You believe the section is private? Sorry, Erika, I think you're on mute. Yeah, yeah, it's my understanding it's a private way. Okay. Right, because if it's a private way, then you can accommodate parking on the street and it's outside of our jurisdiction. Right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Erica Schwartz - 702</summary>

> But the parking that is on the property would have to follow the bylaw. And so the spaces have to be seven and a half by 18 or eight and a half by 18 and not in the front yard, which is a front yard that faces Parker. So would it be possible to just extend the driveway farther back so that that, what here is rendered as the blue car could effectively be parked farther from the street?  We believe so. We just have to verify that, but we believe we can create a setback from the street to where the parking officially starts. So we feel confident we can address that. Okay. The zoning board is amenable to us having the driveway. And then could I just ask a question? Please. What is the amount of space that's required to be called front yard that we wouldn't be parking on? Is there a dimension there that it would have to not encroach upon? It is, so unfortunately I can't read the numbers on the drawing that's on the screen, but basically whatever, so the setback where the building comes closest to that side street, that there's a setback, is it say 12 feet maybe?  Yeah. The existing building? Yeah. The existing building? Okay. So as long as that 12 feet is maintained, and actually that raises another interesting question, which is that the accessory dwelling unit is also located partly in the front yard. I know it's all in the, is it in the front yard or the side yard? Okay. This was confusing to me just because the address of Dorothy Street, right? Yeah, yeah. Faces Dorothy, that's the front of the two family, but we're creating an accessory dwelling unit that will essentially face Parker Street. So I got a little caught up in what's considered a front yard or not, but. Yeah, so it's a corner lot. So it has two front yards that face the two rights of way. So one faces Parker, one faces Dorothy, and then it has one side yard and one rear yard, but you get to choose. So the choice, I believe that was made here, is that the side yard is the one that goes along Dorothy and the rear yard is the one that faces the end of Parker Street there. So that's a little confusing in the zoning bylaw as to whether that portion of the lot, that corner on Parker, if that is still within the rear yard, or if that is front yard. The front yard yard extending the full width of the lot between the front line of the nearest building wall and the front line. And the rear yard is a yard unauthorized by accessory structure or accessory use is herein permitted extending the full width of the lot. Well, that's not helpful. They both say they stretch the full width of the lot, but in this corner condition, where does one end and the other begin? Because my concern is, again, is that table that gives the setback dimensions for accessory structures in the residential districts. It's six feet from the rear and six feet from the side lot line, but it's 20 feet from the front, which in this case would be 12 because it's established elsewhere on the lot. But that would severely curtail the ability to locate the building in this position, which we're trying desperately not to curtail. Mr. Chair. Mr. LeBlanc. There is a illustration in section two that I don't know if that's when you're looking at that designates front lot lines and rear and side lot lines for corner lots. There's a notation on it that says one of each and determine that owner's discretion. Right. What I'm getting hung up on is the definition for front lot line says it's the full width of the lot and the rear lot line also says it's the full width, but obviously they can't both be the full width because they overlap. So which prevails? I think certainly what we would like to try to do is get this so that there are no variance requests.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Adam LeBlanc and/or Patric Hanlon - 222</summary>

> Mr. LeBlanc. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. So I assume that the definitions are struck in this way because unless you have a corner lot, the front yard never intersects with the rear yard. And so the problem of overlap never comes up and the draftsman just didn't, or the drafters, I guess you'd say, didn't have this situation in mind when they drew the definitions. And I guess, there's no way that we can just make something up because somehow this has to get resolved one way or the other. But maybe somebody's already made something up and I wonder if we could have a conversation or get the idea of inspectional services as to what to do in this situation or less usefully possibly as what this board may have done in the past. But I'm guessing that that would be extremely hard to find. We might be able to find our way through this. Assuming that it turns out that that way of approaching it is useful for the applicant because it still does a fair amount of eliminating their flexibility on how to proceed here. But other than that, we just have to, in the absence of guidance from inspectional services, it seems to me, we just have to decide how to reconcile these irreconcilable things in this situation.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 142</summary>

> Absolutely. There are other questions from the board at this moment? Mr. Chair. Mr. Riccadeli. If I could just ask the question of the applicant, just because this has come up in past projects, but especially if we have lot line conditions, if this were a garage, we'd be requiring type one or type two construction for that wall, but also limiting the amount of openings in the wall that's on the zero lot line condition. And there's our zoning, Arlington zoning, but also the building code under three feet will actually not allow openings in that zero lot line condition wall. So I'm just wondering for the applicants, would that be a possibility with your plans to first construct it in a non-combustible way at the zero lot line condition, and also to reconfigure to not have openings along that side?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 83</summary>

> Getting to a type one or type two construction with our current construction method is gonna be pretty hard for us to do. The second thing is we were given our understanding that the wooded area in the back may not be developed in the foreseeable future. We were actually hoping to lean into that fact and actually move all of our windows to that side and actually have that be more of the pub. So very counter to what you're suggesting, unfortunately.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 94</summary>

> Yeah, I understand. I think that this has such great merit. And like the other board members, I think we would really love to see a lot of these in Arlington, so hopeful that there's a way we can get there. So I think that that, like I said, may not be a zoning code issue that may be a building code issue. So I'm not sure, well, this board would not have the authority to get around those requirements in terms of openings. So just something to consider as you all move forward.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 101</summary>

> Yeah. Yeah, and if I could just add, we will have to consider that obviously if it's a building code issue, but part of it was also that for the privacy, this is relatively close to the main structure. And so for our existing tenants, they indicated understandably like, well, how close is it gonna be? Can we still have some privacy? So we thought, well, if we have more windows on the wooded side, it's nicer for the people in the new ADU and it's nicer for the existing tenants. But so we'll see if we can work that out.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Venket Holi - 83</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Hawley. The exception 5428 for exemption for energy efficient homes does have an existing principal building by definition here. The minimum frontage and the lot area exemptions are made for a HERS score of 50, 44 or better, but we're not doing in the existing foundation footprint. So, or by a special permit, it's an and requirement there, right? It's both, or it's, sorry, it's an all requirement. You know, it's not, you know, would that apply in this situation?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 79</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Sorry, was that Mr. Hanlon? Mr. Hanlon, what that gets you is the inadequate frontage and inadequate lot size would be forgiven under those circumstances, which would make some lots buildable that otherwise are not buildable. But I don't see how that would, here that's not a problem to begin with. You're doing an accessory building on an existing lot and regardless of the lot size and frontage, you're able to do that under the ADU bylaw.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 161</summary>

> Okay. At this stage, I do want to, if I could ask the applicant to stop the screen sharing and then I would like to open for public comment. I don't know if there are members of the public who are here to talk to this, but I would like to give them an opportunity if there are. So in a moment, I will open the hearing for public comment. Public comment is taken as it relates to the matter at hand. It should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing our decision. If you wish to speak, you can digitally raise your hand using the button on the reactions tab and the Zoom application. If you're on phone, you can dial star nine. You'll be called upon by the chair as to give your name and address of the record and given time for your questions and comments. So with that, we have one speaker, Rebecca Gruber.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rebecca Gruber - 85</summary>

> Rebecca Gruber, 215 Pleasant Street. Thank you for letting me speak. I'm very excited about the HCA's proposal for this ADA unit and the type of construction being proposed. I remember that when town meeting voted on the ADU bylaws, this was one of the hopes they had for the use of ADUs. And I'm very supportive of the ZBA finding a way to make this work and having this opportunity for adding an affordable unit in our town. Thank you very much. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 238</summary>

> Mr. Moore. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. I find myself in the unenviable position of, I believe, disagreeing somewhat with Mr. Hanlon in terms of his interpretation of the ADU bylaw. I think it hinges on the definition of the word creation. My memory of the discussions that occurred around this town meeting was that the idea was to have ADUs occur as part of existing structures or renovation of existing structures, be them within the primary residence or conversion of a garage like we've discussed, like folks have been discussing earlier, not the demolition of a garage and a rebuild of a new structure. And because I think that's a stretch of the ADU bylaw because you're taking an accessory drilling unit in that case and not putting it to a different use. You're removing it and building another accessory structure, which I think is a different concept. And I think it's important because I thought the point of the ADU bylaw was to take what is somewhat accessory structures that are used for one use and adapting either to that use plus another or adopting it entirely to the other use in terms of a garage, for instance, but not tearing it down and building a new structure. So I'm a little confused about why this is okay here. And maybe Mr. Hanlon can enlighten me as to why I am wrong.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 399</summary>

> Mr. Hanlon. Mr. Chairman, let's take a simpler situation. Let's suppose that you have a relatively small house and you don't have a garage and you have enough room to build a new structure, a new accessory structure that is not within six feet of the line. In that situation, there is not a single word in the bylaw that prevents you from doing that. And not only that is it doesn't come to us, it goes directly to Mr. Champa who would approve it as a matter of right. There is not a word that says you have to be repurposing an existing building. The language is always just an accessory building and this would be an accessory building. All right, so suppose you take the next step. Suppose you say, well, that's all true, but suppose you already have a garage there, but it's an old ugly garage and you don't wanna use it. Well, you say, okay, I'll take away that garage, I'll demolish it. It's empty. Now it's empty like it was in the first example. I'm gonna build a building there and it's a new accessory building and it's not within six feet of the lot line. Again, Mr. Champa would decide this all by himself and he wouldn't have a single word in the bylaw to rely on to say you couldn't do that. So what is the difference between that and what happens if you build it within six feet? The only difference is that it comes to us. The only difference is the jurisdiction and what we have to do, what we have to do there is apply a very limited standard of review in order to approve it. So it seems to me that the notion you have to be, that there's not baked into this bylaw the notion that you have to be using a preexisting building. You can build a new one, you could demolish and do another one. The only thing that was left over was what happens when you get close to a lot line. And there, it seems to me that the language I read earlier is fully consistent with the notion that it doesn't have to be a primary garage and that for that matter, the rules that do apply to garages don't apply to the accessory buildings that are envisioned by the bylaw.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 140</summary>

> Thank you. Okay, Mr. Chair, I appreciate that enlightenment because that's, I understand what you're saying. I just, my memory of the conversations were evolved a little differently than that. during the creation of the bylaw. But as you say, the words are what the words are in the bylaw and where it is silent, I guess you can do that. Even though my memory of the discussions were different than that. All right, well, thank you. One additional question, was the plan for the Arlington Housing Corporation and the applicant, and I'm not sure who the applicant is therefore, I guess it's the corporation. I'm not sure. Is the plan to make this, when you want to set an affordable rental unit, would the plan be for that to transfer with the property or is it just an aspiration?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore and Erica Schwartz - 183</summary>

> I'm not sure what you mean by transfer with the property, but it will be a rental unit. So it will basically, as if 40 to 42 Dorothy Road was a triple-decker or a three-family, it will, I'm not sure if I'm understanding your question. So at this point, the Housing Corporation of Arlington does own the building at 40, 42. It would be operating it as, they will continue operating it as an accessible property. And thus the ADU will add a third affordable unit on the property. Okay, all right. I didn't know with the whole discussion we've had about affordability lately, if it was going to be something which would follow with the property in terms of defining what affordable is, market rate or less than that. Yeah, in fact, we plan to set the same affordability restriction that we have on the other house, on the existing house, just to make things a little easier to manage. And so it'll align with the rest of our portfolio as far as level of affordability. Right, great. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 236</summary>

> Thank you. So it does sound like we have a couple of questions for Inspectional Services. And we would love to give the building designer an opportunity to see if there's a way to come closer to being within the requirements of the zoning bylaw. And so actually, well, first we have no other people in the speaking queue, so I'm going to go ahead and close public comment. So with that done, then we have, as I said, we have questions for Inspectional Services. There are some questions for the designer about what they may be able to accomplish. So my recommendation, if the applicant is amenable, would be to seek to continue this hearing to give us an opportunity for both sides to do a little bit of research so we can come back together with a little more, a little better information in front of us. So we do have, we did just continue something to November 28th. We do have a hearing on November 14th, if there's a sense that we could get information together by that date. And there's also December 12th. So I would just ask the applicant if any of those three dates being November 14, November 28, or December 12 would work for them. Erika, November 14 works for us, if that works for you? Yeah, we could make that work. Okay. There's, yeah. So with that, then-
</details>
<details><summary>	 Adam LeBlanc - 138</summary>

> Mr. Chair? Mr. LeBlanc? I just have one more quick thing. Yes, please. I just was noticing with the elevations, with it being on the helical piles, there's a gap between the bottom of the building and the ground. And I was just curious if there's been any thoughts about how that may get infilled to prevent, you know, debris or wildlife living in there. And I think maybe that's something that can come back either when we do continue it to the next one, just come back with a thought on that. Thank you for raising that. This is still an early schematic design. The plan is to have skirting around it, so none of that stuff is exposed, but we'll make sure to update our drawings for the hearing on the 14th. That'd be much appreciated.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 143</summary>

> Mr. Chairman?  Mr. Hanlon? Before making a motion on this, I just wanted to say again what I think has already been clear, but just to make it very clear, given the state statute, if we have to grant a variance, we'll have a hard time doing it. So the task that's before us is to figure out some combination of figuring out what the, of dealing with the rules and dealing with the building that get the variances out of the picture. If this is a special permit only, then it will not be a particularly hard problem for us, I think. But if it's a variance, it's an extremely difficult problem. So that's kind of what the task, the mission is for the next couple of weeks. And I wish the applicant great success in being able to do that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 84</summary>

> Absolutely. With that then, the chair would entertain a motion to continue the hearing for 4042 Dorothy Road to a date certain of November 14th, 2023 at 7.30 PM. Mr. Chairman, so moved. Second. Second, Mr. DuPont. So this is a motion to continue to the date certain of November 14th. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Hanlon. Aye. Mr. Hawley. Aye. Mr. Riccadeli. Aye. Ms. Hoffman. Aye. Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. Chair votes aye. We are continued on 4042 Dorothy Road. Thank you all very much.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 60</summary>

> So with that, then we would move on to docket 377.128, Buena Vista Road. Would first like to express our gratitude for their patience this evening. It's been a lot longer getting to you than we had anticipated. But with that, I would ask the applicants if they could introduce themselves and tell us what they would like to do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Valerie Bruneau Stone and Matthew Stone - 322</summary>

> Yes. Thank you for having us. I'm Valerie Bruno Stone. My husband, Matthew Stone is sitting next to me. And we're also joined by our architect, Leslie Mahoney. Hello. We are excited to bring this plan forward. We purchased our home at 28 Buena Vista Road with plans to stay long-term and invest in Arlington. Our oldest child began kindergarten this fall and our youngest will be in school in another three years. So we have many more years to reside and invest in our neighborhood and in our community. Our home truly has not been updated since it was built in the 1940s. We've lived without a dishwasher with two young children for several years, which is no small feat. All the work that we have done to improve our home so far, for example, the windows and the roof, we've done in keeping with the original character of the house and we have every intention of doing the same with this proposed addition. We believe that there's actually very little impact on the view from the street and that that's a plus in our design. We've lived here now for almost eight years. We have a good sense of how our family lives in the space and our needs for the space and we've designed the space with that in mind and tried to be very efficient and mindful of how to make efficient use of the space to preserve as much open area as possible. So we'd like to request your support in expanding our home to meet our family's needs and continuing to grow and invest in our neighborhood and in our community. And so with that, we'll turn it over to our architect, Leslie. Leslie, would you like permission to share your screen? Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you. Pauline, if you could take care of that. Perfect. Thank you so much. You should be all set.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Leslie Mahoney - 498</summary>

> Okay. Excellent. Okay. So I'll explain to you how we have a pre-existing non-conforming house on a non-conforming lot. These are just existing elevations and I will point out right here on the right side elevation, there is a small screen porch that is currently has no foundation. It's just on piers. And I'll be talking about that. All the addition is going primarily on that right side and on the rear. These are the existing plans and this is looking from the front, that is the screen porch. It's more of a sunroom really. The foundation plan, you'll see where we are adding. We're adding foundation where that sunroom was. And it is a similar footprint, but it is pulled back toward the house by six inches. We are currently non-conforming on this side. The right side has 8.6 feet to the property line and we are planning to make it nine. And then on this side over here, we are currently, where do I have that information? We are currently sitting at nine feet and we're extending that line straight out of the house. The other non-conformity at the property is just the property itself, which only has a 50 foot front, only has a 50 foot front street and we're required to have 60. So here you can see what we're adding. We're just adding some living space, a family room and expand in a kitchen and then a deck in the rear. The second floor, that space has a new primary bedroom over it. So it now becomes a fourth bedroom. And then in terms of the site plan itself, this is, I'm sorry about this, but it's looked at from the opposite side from the rear of the house. So this is the existing property and this is the new property. So in terms of gross square footage, we are adding more than 750 square feet. We are adding 1,272 square feet. And this is a sloped piece of the property here. And so, but our usable space still fits on the more or less flattish area in the rear of the property. So I just wanted to bring that to your attention. So those are the large issues with this. This is two story and this new piece on the side is one story. Here are the new elevations. So this is the new elevation to the rear. This is the elevation from the front and you can see the rebuild of the sunroom in a smaller configuration and part of the primary bedroom that pops up behind, which is here. It's a good question. So in the upper right corner, unfortunately they both say left side on the right side there. You would see, so you're adding a sort of a new shed essentially off the main ridge going towards the rear. So that would pop up on the, you just see a little sliver of it in that upper plan.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 59</summary>

> I'm a little, I'm just not quite sure what I would be looking at from that side. And it's partially because I'm a little confused by the gable on the, the new gable on the rear where the peak of it is just slightly offset from the main building. It's not quite sure how all those facets come together.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Leslie Mahoney and Christian Klein - 149</summary>

> Right, I have a roof plan here. Let me show that to you. Maybe that will help. So this is the new rear piece that's being added and it's a shed roof that's being overlaid on the main house itself. Okay. The existing ridge is parallel to the street and then the new gabled roof is tying into that shed roof. I've attempted to line these up and due to just dimensional reasons, it hasn't happened. Partly because we're trying to keep this line exactly where it is. The dashed line, is that an inflection in the roof or is that just the line of the existing house? That's the line of the existing house. Okay. Yeah, this is overlaying all the way up as shown here. This is the new kitchen and primary bathroom addition here and there's a roof line that's going all the way up there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Leslie Mahoney - 292</summary>

> Okay. So as you had said that there's non-conformities in the side, existing non-conformities in the side yards.Right. On the one side, the non-conformity is being reduced from 8.6 feet to 9.1 feet. So it's moving farther away. On the other side, even though it's in line with the side of the building, because it's at an angle to the side lot line, that one is slightly increasing from 9.1 to 8.9. That's right. As it goes back. And even less with the deck but we can certainly hold the deck back. Yeah, it increases by about two inches because the side line is at an angle. Okay. And then as you said, the frontage is not existing, non-conforming, the lot area is existing non-conforming. Neither of those are. Right. And then the other question I had was in regards to the usable open space. So you had indicated that you were, that the proposed usable open space is 930 square feet and the proposed gross floor area is 3,264. And that comes up to a usable open space percentage of 28%, which is less than 30. So I'm wondering if there's a couple more inches in that flat-ish space in the back that there is a usable open space back there that would keep you under, over 30%. Because you can actually go, so the usable open space can extend over the deck. Okay. So you can bring it up to the back of that house. And I think that will get you where you need to be. Yeah, that would be fine. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Yeah, Inspectional Services considers going onto decks as an acceptable practice for usable open space. Okay. Yeah, we can show a new calculation for that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 95</summary>

> And then this, and as you had said, this is a request, this is a large addition. Right. And so the board would, in addition to the regular findings, the board would need to find that the alteration or addition is in harmony with the structures and other uses in the vicinity that consider the dimensions and setbacks in relation to the abutting structures and uses and consider conformity with purposes of the bylaw. So with that, I would ask members of the board if they have questions and comments in regards to this application.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 128</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I have a question. Because this is a large addition, it's especially important the relationship between the addition and the surrounding properties. And I wondered if you could, or if the owner could provide some description of what's on the other properties that are around here. I hate to put it in terms of what would the neighbors think, but that's kind of where you are. And it makes a difference how crowded it is and so forth, as you no doubt have noticed in some of our earlier cases. So if somebody could just describe what's around this and how this addition is going to relate to the dimensions and where the other properties are, the other buildings are in the immediate vicinity.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Valerie Bruneau - 181</summary>

> So our neighbor to the, you're looking at the house to the left, has a very similar- I can't, could you try to get a little closer to the microphone? You're hard to hear. Sorry. Our neighbor to the left of our property has a very similar addition. It's a slightly larger house than ours. They did their addition just this year. The neighbor to the right of ours has a very similar footprint and their deck extends out to about where the end of our addition would be. So I would say, I wouldn't describe it as a crowded situation. Right, here we go. Yeah, you can see the addition. that the neighbor put on here, it's very similar. It's a two-story addition. And then this is the neighbor over here who has the deck that extends out similar to where we're gonna come out to. And then to the rear of us, the house is quite a ways away and it's sort of a lower elevation as well. So it doesn't, there's a fair amount of space between there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 230</summary>

> Great, thank you. Thank you. Zip around. Very helpful. Thank you, Google. Okay. Other questions or comments from the board? Seeing none, I will go ahead and open the meeting for public comment. Reminder, the public comment is taken as it relates to the matter. Hand should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing our decision. Members of the public who wish to speak can digitally raise their hand using the raise hand button on the reactions tab in the Zoom application. Or if you're calling in by phone, you can dial star nine. Is there any members of the public who wish to address the board? Okay. Mr. Moore, did you want to raise your hand? Nope, okay. And with that, I see no members of the public who wish to address the meeting. So I will go ahead and close public comment as it relates to this hearing. So for the board, what we have before us, this is an application which comes to us for a special permit for the large addition. But additionally, there is an existing nonconformity. So there would be a very slight increase in the nonconforming nature of the structure. We just need to find that it would not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhoods than the existing condition. So are there other questions or comments from the board?
</details>

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Riccobelli. I sort of hate to ask this question since we've talked about this a lot this evening, but I remember reviewing a similar case with a two-story addition on the back. And I'm just looking at the pictures of this house and there's a significant grade change. I'm just wondering if that average grade calculation has been done for this just to make sure that that lowest level is not counted as a level. I'm not sure if Ms. Mahoney, if that's something you've already looked at.

> Yes, I did look at it and it's not an official level. I'm just counting it in the gross square footage. I have the information here. Is the question asked on the application? The application would ask for the existing height and proposed height. Right, I know I show on the rear elevation drawing the average height of the structure. And I do have basement story if ceiling is 4'6 above grade, it's not. Yeah, elevations show the average grade. Yeah, I would have to find those calculations and get them to you. I did calculate it and it does not count as a story. Okay. Because I had the same, I was curious as well. Great, yeah, we had a recent case where it looked just like this house. And it just tipped over that border into being a story and it got much more complicated from there. So thank you.

> Sure. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. One thing I'd just point out is in the memorandum we got from the inspectional services today, there was no indication that there was a potential violation of the rule of height and story. So I at least take comfort in the fact that ISD has not signaled that as an issue.

> Good point, thank you. Okay, so with that, are there any further from the,

> Mr. Chairman. Just to have it clear on the record, I think that when we look at the three particular criteria, the compliance with the purpose of the zoning bylaw, dimensions with respect to other uses and buildings in the vicinity, that the answer that we were provided when I asked that question was appropriate. It seemed to me that it did allay the notion that there was somehow an unusual crowding here or something that would make this unreasonably impinge upon the buildings or uses in the immediate vicinity so that the, I think that the board can find that each of the three requirements of this particular, of the special regulation are met on the, without going through all of the other seven, it seems to me that this is consistent with the neighborhood. It's clearly allowed by a special permit and that the board can find that each of the requirements of section 3.3.3 are fairly clearly met in this case. Great, thank you. And to that, I would just add the, in regards to the increase in the non-conforming nature of the structure that is incredibly minor going from 9.1 to 8.9 feet on the one side and is more than well offset by the reduction in the non-conforming nature on the opposite side of the house. So Mr. Chairman here, when the motion is eventually made as I assume there'll be a motion to approve this, we ought to be clear that we're talking just an abundance of caution is that we would not only be addressing the grant of the large addition, but also any possible question about the extension of an existing non-conformity.

> Absolutely. So should the board vote to approve, there are three standard conditions that the board would impose on a grant such as this. First is that the plans and specifications approved by the board for the special permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington in connection with the application for zoning relief. There should be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. Number two is the building inspector is hereby notified that he's to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time determines that violations are present. Building inspector shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw, none of the provisions of chapter 40, section 21D of the Massachusetts general laws and institute non-criminal complaints. If necessary, the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action also in accordance with section 3.1. And then standard number three, the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to this special permit grant. With those, are there any additional conditions that the board would want to impose upon this grant?

<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 131</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? Yes, Mr. Hanlon. Earlier, there was a question about adjusting, about usable open space. And I think that Ms. Mahoney undertook to update the plans to show more clearly where the usable open space would be. And so I think a condition that the applicant update its plans in order to correct the calculation of usable open space would be a useful additional criteria. So the applicant is to provide a revised site plan indicating and dimensioning the areas of the existing and proposed site that comply with the requirements for usable open space as indicated in section two of the zoning bylaw town of Arlington to the inspectoral services department for review and approval. That was terrific, Mr. Chairman. It's not like I had that pre-written or anything.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 144</summary>

> Is there anything, any other conditions that members of the board would want to consider? Seeing none, with no further questions, the chair would entertain a motion. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Hanlon. I move that the board approve this application subject to the three standard conditions plus the additional condition updating usable open space that the chair just read into the record. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. So this is a vote of the board to approve special permit for 28 Buena Vista Road with the four conditions as previously read into the record. The vote of the board, Mr. DuPont? Aye. Mr. Hanlon?  Aye. Mr. Hawley? Aye. Mr. Riccardelli? Aye. And the chair votes aye. The special permit for 28 Buena Vista Road is approved. Great, thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks. And again, thank you for your patience this evening. Thank you.

> Indeed, good night. Night. We'll say the success rate of people in cases that start after 10 o'clock is really very high at this point. Don't let that get around. We almost finished earlier than town meeting would. Just over. It feels good to be non-controversial. Yes, it does. I hope you are happy ending on a high note. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, good night. So just for the board, so we did continue two hearings. We have one that's continued to the 14th, one that's continued to the 28th. According to Colleen, we don't have any other items on the agendas for those two nights, but I had asked her for the 14th to put some time in for the board. So we've been kind of going at a breakneck pace on a lot of stuff for a while. And I think it would be a good time for us to just sort of take a breather and review some of our procedures, some of our documentation. I think a lot of you noticed that this was the first time we got the applications were electronically submitted for the zoning board. So I think we want to take a look at that procedure, make sure that the documentation that we're able to get works well for us, that the procedure works well for the applicants. I think we're going to have to make some adjustments to our rules and regulations in order to better coincide with that. There's definitely a couple of things that I know I need to adjust as well. And the other thing I'd like to try to do on the 14th is talk a little bit, if there are any zoning amendments that we would like to propose. I know we've talked several times about the gap between an attached and a detached dwelling. And there's a couple of others that I sort of picked up along the way. And today we're sort of that question about accessory dwelling units being within six feet of the thing would be good to sort of clarify. So if there are any sort of things like that that have sort of come up that you've come upon, it'd be great to discuss them on the 14th. And then I will schedule time with the ARB in December to discuss those with them as they put together their docket going into the spring. They have notified me that they are planning to put forward a major zoning package for the Arlington Heights Overlay District. So they do have some other big things they're trying to do in the spring. But I have been nagging them about these ones. So hopefully we'll be able to get this included in the spring as well. So that's what we'll do on the 14th as well as that other case that we just put onto the 14th. So with that, I would like to thank you all for your participation in tonight's meeting of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. Appreciate everyone's patience throughout the meeting. I'd especially like to thank Colleen Ralston and Mike Cunningham for their assistance in preparing for and hosting and participating in this online meeting. Please note the purpose of the board's recording this meeting is to ensure the creation of an accurate record of its proceedings. It is our understanding recording made by ACMI will be available on demand at acmi.tv within the coming days. If anyone has comments or recommendations please send them via email to dba.town.arlington.ma.us. That email address is also listed on the Zoning Board of Appeals website. And to conclude tonight's meeting, I would ask for a motion to adjourn. Mr. Chairman, so moved. Thanks. Second. And seconded by the vote of the board to adjourn, Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Hanlon. Aye. Mr. Hawley. Aye. Mr. Riccardelli. Aye. Ms. Hoffman. Aye. And Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. The chair votes aye, we are adjourned. Thank you all so much. I'm sorry it was a late night and we'll see you all on the 14th. Have a good one. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night.
