<details><summary>Docket #3770 40-42 Dorothy Road (continuance)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 164</summary>

> So the first item on the first several items on the agenda relate specifically to the board. And so I'm going to go ahead and skip ahead to the hearings, which brings up item five on our agenda which is docket 3770 4042 Dorothy road. This is a continuance of an existing prior hearing, which was on October 24. At the time we had discussed with the applicant certain changes that we thought would be appropriate and helpful in their presentation, and we have received revised information from the applicant and so with that, I will turn to if she would like to have if she has any comments. Otherwise we'll have the architect present the changes. No, I think we're okay to go to the gas. Yeah, no we're, you know, we're excited about this I get to actually live down the street from this so I'm very excited. Wonderful. Thank you. And for the record, I'm not an architect. Oh, that's reflected.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 591</summary>

> I'm part of the company reframe systems, we've been working with the architect who's revised this version of the design his name is Andrew McHugh. And he's not on the call but I'll be working closely with them so we can represent the views there. If I can share my screen I can walk the group through the changes we're proposing. I know there's been a few sets of documents on the docket, it should be the last three. You are all set. Thank you, Colleen. Thank you. Just to recap for the audience, we're referring to the parcel of 4042 Dorothy road. This is a corner a lot of intersection of Dorothy road and Parker Street Parker Street is a private way, as it gets into the end where Dorothy is. And we're proposing demolishing this garage, that's circling read to build passive house zero so it's a net zero energy at you. We'll be utilizing some modern methods of construction will be fabricating a bunch of these components at a factory up in Andover. And we're building this for the Housing Corp of Arlington, and this will help increase the affordable housing supply in the town of Arlington. Would it be helpful to recap where we started or should I just jump into what we're proposing. I think you can jump into what you're proposing. Okay, so we're. We made significant changes since the last time we were here. So we brought the footprint down to the ADU subtracting the mechanical room will be 900 square feet, and the height is at 20 feet so we comply with the zoning there. So, because this is a corner lot and we have two front yards. We are bringing the front setback to be compliant with existing conditions which is at 12 feet. So we've updated that change. And we're also moving the parking spots from our previous proposal and utilizing section 61.10.a, because of the corner lot provision. So we're utilizing the language there to propose that we park two spots parallel to the front yard, as defined in the zoning bylaw, and our updated request to the zoning board is twofold. One, we've had to. Let me move to the next screen here, just so we have a closer look. The first request is that we be allowed to move the site setback the existing conditions that five and five feet and five inches. Our updated request is to have the site setback move to three feet, 10 and a half inches. There is no other structure in this corner of the lot, so we don't foresee posing any new fire hazards but we will comply with Massachusetts Building Code and have a one hour fire rated wall on the side of the ADU. And our second request is to update the rear setback from the lot line, as it currently exists, the garage that exists actually is over the property line by five inches. We're proposing demolishing that and actually creating an average of six foot nine inches of a lot line setback, but there will be this portion of the ADU that will be under six feet, with the closest point being five feet and a half inch, and seven feet and one inch on the other end. And to comply with Building Code, we're actually over the five foot limit so we seem to be okay on that end. And let me pause there and take any questions before we go further. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

> So, Mr. Hamlin. No, no, no, please go ahead. I can wait. No, go ahead. I was just trying to understand the, with respect to the parking is a provision that you're relying on Mr NT is the one that says that if you are parking on a paved driveway in a corner lot of less than 6000 square feet, which you are. And in the longer of the two front yards which I think you are, that you can have a driveway of up to a maximum of 24 feet in width and park on that and the idea here is that the two parking spaces that are parallel to the street. Basically have a risk when you combine them, the width is 24 feet they're 22 each and their depth is eight feet so that's why they comply with 6.1 point 10 a, do I understand that correctly. That is right. And the reason we can do this with minimal issue to the neighborhood as the, the curbs already cut previously like the curb actually ends right here on this private way so we don't pose any further challenges to the neighborhood, and we seem to comply with the language and the bylaw. So which is why we're, we're suggesting we proceed with without interpretation. So this is basically an eight foot driveway with a 20 foot with 24 foot with 4044 foot with 4444 foot but but it's so we're interpreting the eight foot width, as, as the width into the property, because it doesn't quite specify which access to measure the width against so we're interpreting the width. As the width into the property, keeping that eight foot wide and 44 feet long. Okay, got it. So I had a conversation with the building inspector about on this question. And his, his sense is that this is a 44 foot wide driveway. Because of the way it's oriented. And so I was looking around the site I had a question there's a, an area on the site here that's identified as a pad. What exactly is that.
</details>
<details><summary>	  Vikas Enti - 537</summary>

> So, I don't know, Gabby if you have more history for it. If not, I can relay what Erica's relate to me.  Which part, can you. So the concrete pad that's out here. Okay, that's Dorothy. So, yeah, those. I mean I live, it's, I guess it's a concrete pad I mean the garage. There's, you know, the property has a fence around both side yards. And then there's this, you know, like as a company you know pavement, I would, I would say and then the garage. I don't think there's anything. If you have something from Erica I mean as far as I know there's nothing special there, I think it's just like a bigger. My understanding is that a previous tenant actually had the pad installed as part of this construction project. He has requested that we demolish the pad so we create more more green space for the principal building. So, that should be removed as part of this project. And our plan for the parking spots to was to use permeable green pavers. So that way, it would still look and feel like a green space. And so far only one tenant seems to be using the parking spot. So in general, we again expect that we're still preserving at least visually as much green space as possible. Because what I was wanting to ask was to the interpretation from inspectional services was that having the two spaces be parallel spaces in this fashion wasn't didn't meet the definition of a 24 foot width. Wasn't didn't meet the definition of a 24 foot width. But what I was curious was if there's that corner of the building. Sort of if you're between the pad yes and that like if you had to front end spaces at that court from the corner of the house, you could easily you should have plenty it's more than 18 feet to the court to the property line. Property line. So you could have to just straight in spaces there and preserve the rest of the site. And that would be that would be with. So if you were amenable to making that change I think inspectional services would accept that change. Got it. We'll discuss this with ACA. We agree that that is a more streamlined solution, and we can update our. At least when we're going for permitting we can update that aspect of the lot. So I think then then our question for the zoning board would be on the do setback special permits requests is, would you be amenable to us increase like reducing the site setback, roughly by one foot and six inches or so on the on the side, and then bringing it between roughly 11 and a half inches to. For one portion of the works. So the side yard set back that is certainly within mass general law, because the, the, it's already an unconforming side yard setback. And so the board by special permit can allow a reduction in that so long as it doesn't create a condition that is significantly more detrimental to the neighborhood, that would be the test that we would have to apply.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti and Various - 675</summary>

> So that's within our right to grant. For the rear yard setback. We've been sort of going back on what the on how to read the zoning bylaw on this question, because there's two that the width. The minimum width is listed in two different places. Going strictly by the the table of dimensions and accessory structure has to be six feet from a side yard in a rear yard. And because the existing garage is being removed. Existing nonconformity there no longer exist. However, Mr Hamlin has put forward a different reaches in the section of the bylaw that deal specifically with at us that it allows a reduction in that below six feet with a similar finding from the Board of Appeals that it is not significantly more detrimental. So Mr Hamlin that that's that was the interpretation you had put forward correct Yes, that's, excuse me, that's right. So with that the board could address both of those questions that you have under section four on your slide. Slide. We discussed section number three we just number two is fine. I do have a question about number one and I'm asking if you could go to the floor plan. There we go. So this is the ground floor, and then this is the second floor. Okay, so on the first floor. The shaded portion is what you are considering the mechanical areas and removing from the gross floor. Correct. That is correct. So we're accounting 42 square feet. So we're using the same interpretation for how we compute floor area so we're accounting for the walls as part of that space. The only concern is, is the that effectively a portion of that is a laundry closet. So the, the reason. Sorry, sir. Sorry. No, I was gonna say this is sort of a question for the board. This is sort of a question for the board to, and we can review the, what the, what the bylaw says but the question is whether the weather a laundry room should be considered part of the mechanical area of the, of the, of the structure or not. If I'm at one, please. One reason for why that was also shaded so when our architect Andrew was going through the plan. The water heater we're using as a heat pump water heater that has to be vented. And in his view the went to actually stick into would be actually above the washer dryer so that space is still in his view, what was primarily serving. The reason he put the washer dryer there was because he saw the ducting for the water heater being about it, and he's found a unified washer dryer. That would actually fit underneath that ducting. So if we had a 3d model that was ready. What we would actually see is this is an HVAC room that's being repurposed as a portion of is being repurposed to have a laundry function just because the space below the duct, rather than a dedicated laundry room that's being subsumed to become part of an HVAC room. Okay. So the, it says, so it's not your typical stacked washer dryer units in their own separate space, it is basically a combined washer dryer standard height unit that fits in underneath the mechanicals for the hot water heater. That's correct. And this is required because this is a heat pump water heater, and we have to duct it because of the space constraints. Okay. And then the mechanical unit that the HVAC unit, that's the other one that's there, that's it, just like a ducted split system unit. Is that what that is. And it's the ERV, because if this is a passive house, we need to have a ERV system that's split in there, and it has all the space for its ducting to flow around. Oh, OK. And then for the heating and cooling, are those wall mount units within the rooms, or is that connected somehow to the ERV?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 97</summary>

> So I need to reconfigure which system they're finally speccing. We had a slightly different version for the previous design. That was a little bigger. But we will be ducting it from the central unit, is my understanding, because we couldn't find one that could be ductless. So it's not a room wall-mounted mini-split. It's still a central system, but we will have ducts running. So that will be connected to the ERV, and we'll be sharing some of the ducting also with the bathroom exhaust fans. So they're all required to be co-located in the area.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 43</summary>

> Great. Thank you. There's something indicated under the stairs. Is that a closet? Is that what that is? Yeah, so that's a cold closet that we're trying to use on the higher end of the risers. Those were the questions that I had.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 15</summary>

> Were there other questions from the board? Mr. Chair. Hearing none. Oh, yes, Mr. Fidelli.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dan Ricardelli - 182</summary>

> Maybe just two questions. So with the new rear yard setback, I know previously, Mr. Ante, you guys explained that you were locating a lot of the windows along the back because that was basically preserved land. Were you able to make that work now having that five foot setback with the opening percentage that's required by the code? Yeah, so the reason we're trying to stay over the five foot line, because I think that's where the Massachusetts building called threshold plug-ins. So with the way the current setback lines up, we're able to comply with building code and have as many openings as we need. So thank you for flagging that during the previous review. That's great. I'm glad to hear that you were able to make it work. And the other question I had, maybe for you or maybe for Ms. Geller, there only seems to be one real neighbor for this location on this property. Have you talked with the neighbor on the side yard setback side? Is there any feedback on the location of the San Diego?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 174</summary>

> So I know from Erica, and I apologize, I'm sort of stepping in last minute, I believe they've spoken with all the neighbors and there haven't been any significant comments. And Vikas, if you have any more to add, because I believe you were with Erica maybe when you. I was with Erica when we spoke to the neighbor across the street. I was in Erica when she made contact with the neighbor that's adjacent to this lot. But I do have some pictures on what that, because Google Maps is not up to date. So the site was updated adjacent to it as they knocked down an existing structure, they redid the existing home. So basically, it's all green space right now. So the picture on the left is what is our pre-existing garage that we are proposing to demolish. So we'll be obviously coming in a little bit in the setback here. But given that it's all wide open green space here, we don't think we'll be intruding on the neighbors too.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 226</summary>

> Thank you, that's very helpful. Thank you. Is there anything further from the board? Hearing none, I will be opening this meeting for public comment. So public questions and comments are taken as they relate to the matter at hand. It should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing our decision. Members of the public will be granted time to ask questions and make comments. Members of the public who wish to speak should digitally raise their hand using the button on the Reactions tab in the Zoom application. Those calling in by phone may dial star 9 to indicate they would like to speak. You'll be called upon by the meeting host asked to give your name and address given time for your questions and comments. All questions are to be addressed through the chair. Please remember to speak clearly. And anyone wishing to address the board a second time during a particular hearing, the chair will allow those wishing to speak for the first time to go first. So with that, if there is any members of the public in attendance who wish to address this application, if they could please indicate that they are seeking to do so. So that's the Raise Hand on the Reactions tab. Or if you turn on your camera and wave, we have Mr. Moore.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 123</summary>

> Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. First question, refresh my memory. Was the roof of this ADU going to be wired for solar panels or something like that? Or am I making it up? That is correct, Mr. Moore. We will have solar panels. OK, Mr. Chair, what I'm wondering is if the modification to the mechanical spaces in the plan, how does that impact the wiring and, I don't know, the utilization of the solar panels? Is it all still fitting within the space? Because I know that solar panels often require particular requirements for conduit and spacing and things like that. And I'm wondering if that's impacted at all by the change in the mechanical space. Mr. Entie?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 84</summary>

> We haven't finished the detailed design for it. My understanding is whatever conduits we need to bring down will be alongside the meter bank that we will need to have. And I think our expectation at this point is if we have availability on setbacks on, at least in between the two building spacings, if we have to use that space, where it doesn't impact the neighbors. So that's an option if we have to go down there. But we haven't done that yet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 39</summary>

> Right, that does, Mr. Chair, that does make sense to use that space between the buildings. And also, I don't know if there's been any changes regarding the exterior cladding or siding that's planned to go on this ADU.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 134</summary>

> That's a really good question, Mr. Moore. So we've basically gone back to the drawing board on the siding. The reason we don't have elevation profiles to share this time around is we decided to wait until the next meeting to see if we could have elevation profiles to share this time around, as we decided to wait till we get the zoning boards OK before we start detailing it out. So at this point, our expectation from also speaking with our client, the Housing Corp of Arlington, was to make it feel, look, and comply with what's in the neighborhood. So it'll be clad board siding, most likely. We're waiting to get some color specifications from them. But I don't expect it to be significantly different than what you see in the neighborhood.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 120</summary>

> Sure, that's helpful. That was one of the concerns I had last time, was the siding was so significantly different than the rest of the neighborhood. I'm glad that you're working with trying to make this fit, since the setbacks are minimal here, and also make it producible in a unitary kind of way, which makes it more affordable for you as the person producing the housing, but also fitting in with the neighborhood, I think is important. So that's good to hear. And I would hope that you would, to whatever extent you can, with prefabricated building materials, follow the design guidelines, which Arlington has. And I'm sure you've been working and looking at already. Thank you, Mr. Chip.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 46</summary>

> Thank you. Just following up on Mr. Moore's question, I know we had addressed briefly the space below the first, between the first floor and the ground. I was curious, Mr. Ante, if you could just comment a little more on how that might be infilled.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vikas Enti - 71</summary>

> So we're definitely going to have skirting around it. We haven't specified the material, but there should be nothing visible. I think walking into the unit, it should just seem like you have, there should be full coverage from the siding of the building to the ground, but nothing exposed. So I think we're definitely factoring that in. It's not going to look any different than the units next to it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 54</summary>

> OK, I was going to say, it's not that the siding is going to be brought all the way to the ground, but the siding will end at the bottom of the structure. And then like every other house in the neighborhood, you'll have a different surface hitting the ground. Exactly. Great, thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 553</summary>

> Are there any other members of the public who wish to address this hearing? Once, twice. I see no one else wishing to address the hearing. So with that, I will go ahead and close the public comment period for this hearing, which returns us back to the board. So what the board has before it, this is a, we have two requests in front of us. First, we have an application for variance and application for special permit. As we had discussed at the prior hearing, we had grave concerns that the board could find that the criteria required for variance could be met for this property. And we had asked the applicant to go back and to reconsider what they were proposing so that a variance would not be required. It definitely appears from the information submitted by the applicant that I believe they have addressed all those points and that at this point, a variance would no longer be required, which does leave us with the question of special permit. And there are several points that the applicant would need to satisfy in order for this. The first is the reduction in the side yard setback, which is a section six determination. So the board would have to find that the change in the side yard setback is not significantly more detrimental to the, than the current condition. Similarly, we would have the same question in regards to the rear yard where, but that is instead of being under section eight, that's actually in section five, nine for accessory dwelling units, which allow an accessory dwelling unit within six feet of the property line with a determination by the board of appeals that it is not significantly more detrimental to the neighborhood. And then I'm trying to think if there are other, I thought there was one more thing that the board needed to determine. Oh, no, I don't think there's anything else the board needs to determine because the one for the accessory dwelling unit covers two things at once. It's both the accessory dwelling unit being in an accessory building and also being within six feet. That's all included in the same determination. We did have still sort of the open question about the parking. We have discussed an alternative to the plan, and I would, I think the board needs to discuss if that's something that we could approve by condition or if that's something that we need to see in a different fashion before the board can vote. And then the only other question that I had had initially was the question about the laundry room. I think that the applicant has explained that it is rather than being a laundry room, it is really just sort of a portion of a mechanical space that otherwise would be unoccupiable that's being used to house a laundry machine, and therefore it's not specific as a laundry room. It's more just a mechanical space that happens to have a laundry machine in it. And as long as the board is comfortable with that determination, then the gross square footage is under 900 square feet. So are there questions and concerns from the board, things that we need to discuss further on this project? Mr. Chairman? Yes, Mr. DuPont.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 69</summary>

> Just very quickly, so, and I just checked with Mr. Cunningham, so I think that it would probably be appropriate to withdraw the application for the variance so that that's clean on the record. And then my two cents on the idea of proceeding with the understanding that the parking is going to be redesigned along the lines that you had suggested pursuant to your discussions with inspectional services,
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 27</summary>

> I would be fine with that as long as everybody thinks it's clearly understood what it is that needs to be done. Okay. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Hanlon.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 14</summary>

> I just wanted to say that I agree with Mr. DuPont on both scores.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 86</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. The only other question I had, too, was in regards to, so the board does not have revised exterior elevations, and the question is just if there are any members of the board who would want to request to see those before voting on approval. The board is allowed to consider the design guidelines as a part of its review, but obviously we have 95% of it. We just don't have final rendered exteriors. Are there any other questions from the board?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 89</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, I think Mr. Cunningham has a comment or a question. Oh, Mr. Cunningham doesn't show up on my screen. Mr. Cunningham, please proceed. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I just wanted to agree with Mr. DuPont, although the withdrawal of the variance would be the prerogative of the applicant that would make it cleaner for the board of appeals. However, if the applicant wants to withdraw that application for the variance, that would make it so that the special permit application is the only thing before the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 72</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Cunningham. So then that would be a question for the applicant. So because we have determined that a variance is no longer required, but there's still an open variance application in front of the board, the board either has to act on it, but there's really nothing to act on. So it would be cleaner if it was withdrawn and then the board doesn't have to make a finding.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 18</summary>

> On behalf of HCA, as the applicant who filed a variance, we withdraw the request for variance 23-1.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 1182</summary>

> Great. Thank you. And where it's done before the vote of the board, the board can accept the withdrawal. Mr. Cunningham, does the board need to make a vote to accept the withdrawal or is it just... No, Mr. Chair. Great. Thank you. Okay. With that, then what the board has in front of it is a special permit application. So the board needs to make a few different findings. So the first is under section 592B, accessory dwelling units. If it's within six feet of a lot line, you need to find that the creation of the accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the use of such accessory building as a private garage or other allowed use. And then under section 8... Which section is it? So under, I think it's 812... Excuse me, 813B, non-conforming single-family or two-family dwellings. The increase in the non-conforming nature of structure will not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing condition. So actually, now that I'm thinking this through, we don't actually need to do that because the finding we make under 592B, that the accessory dwelling unit within six feet of a lot line, that would cover both the rear and the side lot line. So we do not need to worry about section 8 at all. So this just boils down to 592B. And then the board would need to typically use the criteria for a special permit to determine whether this would meet the requirements of a special permit. The first finding is that the requested use is allowed or allowed by special permit in the district. And it is under section 592B, an accessory dwelling unit is allowed within six feet of a property line in an accessory structure by a finding of the board. That the requested use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. The board has routinely found that the addition of housing for its residents is a public good and is desirable for public convenience and welfare. The requested use will not create undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety. This structure actually has no sidewalk in front of it in the area where this is occurring. And there will be no addition of parking spaces, so it will not create any additional traffic congestion. Number four, the requested use will not overload any public system. This will be a minor addition to both the water, sewer, excuse me, the water, sewer and electrical systems, but it will not be a substantial impact. the character or integrity of the neighborhood. So this is the one where we need to, I think, to put the most thought into. So this is something that's new, something that we've not seen before in a lot of ways. This is, and I think the board should, my sense from the board is that they're in agreement that this does not impair the character or integrity of the neighborhood in the way that it has been described by the applicant that it will be sited similar to other buildings in the neighborhood and is of limited space and is located in a rear yard adjacent to a wooded area. Then the requested use will not be detrimental to the public health or welfare. Again, this is a residential use in a residential zone and the requested use will not cause an excess use to be detrimental to the neighborhood. That certainly would not apply here. Should the board want to vote in favor, there are three standard conditions that the board would apply to a case like this. The first is that the plans and specifications approved by the board for the special permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington in connection with this application for zoning relief. There should be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. Number two is the building inspector is hereby notified that they are to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time they determine that violations are present. The building inspector shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw and under the provisions of chapter 40, section 21D of the Massachusetts general laws and institute non-criminal complaints. If necessary, the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action also in accordance with section 3.1. And number three is the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to the special permit grant. We have also noted that we would want to have a condition in regards to the parking. Anybody have some language for what that might look like? The applicant is to provide two parking spaces on applying with the size requirements. The zoning bylaw will be located in the front yard facing, which street is that? Parker Street, I think. Yep, Parker Street. On a driveway, not to exceed 24 feet in width, measured parallel to Parker Street. So as the applicant is to provide two parking spaces complying with the size requirements of the zoning bylaw to be located within the front yard facing Parker Street on a driveway not to exceed 24 feet in width, measured parallel to Parker Street. Does that seem to cover what we had discussed?  Yes. So that will be condition number four. Are there any additional conditions that anyone on the board would want to consider? Seeing none. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. So I wanted to circle back a little bit to the findings. On the second finding about the public convenience and necessity, I think there's quite a lot more to say here that I sort of like to include in the findings. First of all, this is consistent with the town policy of using ADUs in order to provide affordable housing, which the town desperately needs. Secondly, it's energy efficient in a way that goes well beyond what is normally done in the town. And it's a good example of the sort of thing that ought to be done. The third is that it is sort of a variation on that. This is passive house net zero, which means it's actually a full net zero proposal. It's not, and that is also something that is consistent with the town's energy conservation plan. And I guess that the final thing that at least for me is it's an innovative way using the prefabricated methods to reduce the costs of providing the ADUs in this kind of housing, and at the same time, greatly improving sustainability. So when you get down to thinking about why this is in the public interest, there's quite a bit, both in terms of reducing costs and in terms of increasing sustainability, both of which are matters of great concern to the town. Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Are there further comments or questions from the board?  Seeing none, the chair would entertain a motion.

> This brings us up to sort of discussion of procedural business and rules and regulations. So there is a new procedure for applying for special permits and variances, which is it's a new online system. I don't know if any of you have played around with it, but I had played with it a little bit. Currently, there's not a lot of guidance as to how to proceed on it. And there may be something the board wants to take on to put together some things. I would ask Colleen if she could, she has anything she's noticed in particular about applications, changes in the applications coming through the new system.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Colleen Ralston - 411</summary>

> Hi. For the most part, people are having trouble a little bit with the calculations. It's not as clear, I guess, on this one. I've tried to find something that we could put up that would define each calculation for them, but there's nothing clear on that one either. There's a lot of things in the bylaws that say like how to calculate and lots of descriptions, but no clear how to calculate. And I think that's where most people are running into questions. They call me a lot and ask. I send them to Dave. If we could find a better way where they could just do it, it would be much easier for them. Do you think it would be helpful if they sort of did it on paper first and then transferred it into the system as they went? I do. I think that the paper system that we had had a little bit more guidance on it. But I think, Christian, you and I talked about a lot of people are homeowners trying to do it themselves and they're not architects and they're not building inspectors or contractors. Some of them just don't know what they're calculating. I think it's something that the board should probably take on to some extent of drafting some kind of a guidance document, whether in the past, all we had given them was the application and they sort of fuddled through it, but they would come in with it and talk to the inspector as they filled it out. And it's unclear how much that is still happening. Yeah, most of the new program is, cause it's all online, even payment online. There's not a lot of people coming in to ask the questions they're calling. And it's hard to walk them through some of the calculations when you don't have a plot plan or a drawing in front of you. Sure. And a caveat to that is they can't submit the application until everything's finished. So they can't, unless they email you pictures that you're trying to print to scale, it doesn't always work. So could they, they can partly fill it out and save it, but they can't submit it to you until everything's complete. Yes, saves as a draft in their account until it's complete. Okay. But you can't go and see it when it's in that state. No, we can't see it until they actually submit it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Colleen Ralston and Christian Klein and Patrick Hanlon - 1301</summary>

> Okay. Ask Dan and Venkat and Elaine and Adam, if they've run into online application systems and have any advice. I haven't really run into one before. Yeah, I haven't come across it yet. The BPA, the Boston one is online, but I wouldn't say that there is good guidance that accompanies it. So I don't know that we should use that as an example. Okay. Mr. Chairman. Yeah. So this is not from the voice of experience the way you did the people who are actually doing it. The people who are actually dealing with other, but it seems to me that at least a logical way of thinking about it is for us to have a series of instructions. I think maybe separate instructions put into and put on our website so that they have, so that it addresses the things that we think of as the key questions. To some extent, I think we can start with what we already have. And then instead of sort of having a sheet that they have to submit and so forth, we can just include something at the end as a worksheet. I do know that to some extent we do ordinarily get, where it just says, look to the way of calculating gross floor area in the bylaw. We may need to take that out and provide more specific instructions. I think that whenever you tell even professionals, but certainly ordinary people and give them a cross-reference that that doesn't usually prove to be very effective. But I think if we did that, then we could at least create something where they've thought it through in the right way. And I think it might be helpful just from my point of view is to say, I don't know how to deal with this. Very often there are people who say NA and that's almost never the right answer, at least not without a lot of consultation with ISD. And so just because it's too much of a pain in the neck to figure it out, doesn't mean that you don't have to figure it out. And people ought to be encouraged to be careful. But we can put some much truer words in it. I mean, frequently you'll see that when people, in the very first thing on special permits, we say, where is it say in the bylaw that you can have a special permit? And typically many people answer that by just saying what the provision is of the special, of the bylaw that they want relief from and not what they're supposed to be saying, which is what is it that gives them the right to relief by special permit? And if we're doing a little bit more detailed than we do in the application form, you can at least take commonly made errors and either stick them in as a new sentence to make sure that they get it, or maybe do things in the form of a frequently asked questions to make it more pointed. But in doing that, we might be able to make it work a little better. And when they finally get down to put the application, the things in, they may have already done the worksheet and it may facilitate the conversation later on when inevitably there will be some cases where it isn't right and where your discussion has to take place. Very good. So if the board was to draft a set of guidance doc, is there anyone who would like to take a first stab at that? I'd be willing to try. Patrick, do you have a copy of the previous application that I can send or do you need me to send you one? Oh, you should probably send it. I think I have a copy of it. I think we get copies of it regularly, but I'd like to see what they see, which I don't know that for sure that I'm doing. Okay. I was also told that you guys can go in and create yourself an account and do everything and leave it in draft and never submit it. But that would give you an idea of what it's like to just go through the process. Yeah. Okay. The link is on the front page of the zoning website and the inspectional services. Okay. So in some ways there's a parallel thing that goes along with the variance application. I don't know what people are currently getting, but maybe with a little elaboration, since people seem to get the topography a little odd, we could again use what we already have and emphasize the ways in which this is different. I mean, look at how many cases we get where people make a variance application and they don't really understand what the difference is between a variance application and a special permit. Right. No, absolutely. While I'm on a roll, we have a draft, I think a draft, I'm not sure that we've ever done it on the residential design guidelines. And I would like us to take a look at that draft. And as long as we're going to have a website with helpful guidance in it, I think it would be useful to put that on, which actually forces people to focus on what the actual language of the guidelines are and not just sort of say, well, in general, it's all good and consistent with the neighborhood. And so I'd encourage us to do that. I'd encourage us also, we also say. well, they're voluntary, so obviously, we can't just. But I do think that it's important to say that it may very well be that we can say whether you comply with the guidelines is perfectly is voluntary. And the standard we apply is the standards in section 3.3.3, but we don't think an explanation of what you've done is voluntary. In other words, we wanna see that you've gone through this analysis, what your analysis could say is, we think the zoning bylaws should pound sand because we've got other reasons why we think we're entitled to this. And maybe they're right, maybe they're wrong, but showing that they've gone through the analysis and would make them actually go through the analysis, which would be a plus. It's been particularly difficult since we don't get planning department memos anymore, which routinely go into this. So, and I've noticed that since we stopped getting that, we've talked a lot less about the residential design guidelines than we did before. And it would be helpful to try to tee that up procedurally so people feel it's necessary at least to explain their position on it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so what I have up on the screen, so this is something we had pulled together, I'm guessing a while ago now, did I put a date on it? Nope. There was some concern at the time because it is voluntary that by making a form, we're sort of forcing, are we forcing people to abide by the design guidelines? And this does include the, although strict adherence to the design guidelines is voluntary, they express the design principles that the board will use in evaluating residential projects requiring special permit or variance. For each principle listed below, please describe how your project responds to the design guidelines. Okay. So this is certainly something we could include as a part of the application guide. I don't know if this is something that we would want to have them submit electronically necessarily, or if it's just something ancillary that they would either bring to the hearing or just, or submit independently, depending on how we want to do it. Mr. Chair. If it's voluntary.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 227</summary>

> Yes, sir. I don't know if it's appropriate for me to offer some perspective. Sure. Mr. Moore. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. We had an issue like this on the tree committee where we've got what's called construction guidelines for the protections of the critical root zones of trees, either on the property or on the neighboring property and such, and we refined it over time. They are guidelines. They're not requirements because we can't require that it happen. But what it works for us is it offers a point of leverage. And if you don't have them fill out a form like this, you couldn't have a checkbox somewhere that says you've read them. And that allows you as a board to leverage points in it that you want them to pay attention to. Not necessarily, I know again, you can't make it happen, but it's a point of leverage for you to bounce their perceptions off of. And it's been useful to us. Even though, for instance, in critical root zones, if they're not using the correct method for whatever work they're doing, we can say, well, it's right here and we show you how, why did you not do that? Or that sort of thing. So I would suggest you do this. I mean, I think Mr. Hanlon's comments are well taken. That's it, thanks.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 319</summary>

> Thank you, no, appreciate the experience. Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Hanlon. Just in terms of language, I think it would be helpful actually to say strict, to eliminate the word strict and the lead in, because even general compliance with these is not really actually required. They're just guidelines. And so, but secondly, I think that we ought to say that, this is not going to be exact language necessarily, but I think we ought to say that the guidelines often prove relevant to the board in considering such issues as neighborhood compatibility, because that puts people on notice that sure, they don't have to do with the guidelines. They can say, I wanna make it look like crazy Ludwig's Castle, but we're gonna be looking at the guidelines and assessing neighborhood compatibility, which we do have the authority to require. And so a sensible person might want to speak to our condition here and help show why it is that, and use this as a way of making their point on the requirements of section 3.3.3. So anyway, it focuses more on just what we mean by, what's voluntary and what isn't, right? This is a help for the applicant really, to understand where we're coming from when we do something, when we apply this, and there's a specific provision. This could come up in other provisions too, but there's a specific provision about neighborhood compatibility that this is almost always relevant to. And somebody who wants some help in thinking about how to persuade us should understand that showing what they've done in terms of the guidelines is helpful to them. So anyway, you can sort of figure that around and what you've just done is right. But I think it helps to sort of position this as not just another bunch of requirements, but a way of showing that you meet a requirement that already exists.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 158</summary>

> Okay. Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. So I'm just looking at the language, sort of trying to split the difference between a requirement and a strong suggestion. And I'm not sure what the answer is, but in the third paragraph where it says the design guidelines is voluntary or are voluntary, but- Adherence to the design guidelines is voluntary. Oh, I'm sorry. They express the design principles that the board will use and is use too soft a word upon which the board relies or is that too strong a word? I'm just wondering, because you really do want to get them to focus on these, even if they're not mandatory, because it's for their benefit, obviously, if they do. And I didn't know, so use is fine, but I just didn't know whether rely upon is a little bit more, you know, a little bit more pointed and tell some, you should pay stronger attention. Just a thought.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 601</summary>

> Yeah. So one of the other things we had sort of thought about earlier on and I really looked at in a while was putting together a checklist so that people who are applying know what they need to have. And this could be something that we could adopt into a lead in, into a guide document. Originally this was when you were submitting everything paper, so you would have to do it all, but like information needs to be filed electronically. Applicants are advised to gather all the requested information before initiating the online permitting process. And that's probably going to be bold. So the completed requests of this sort of, these were the documents we had before. So I think, so as we were discussing, what we might do is rather than handle things in this fashion, we would do it a little more sort of line by line, going through the information that needs to be provided. One of the things that often happens to us is that there's information that occurs on both the dimensional and parking information sheet and on the open space gross floor area sheet. And the same figure will be entered differently on the two sheets. So one of the things we can sort, and the way that it appears on the website right now, we ask the same question twice. So we could either have it be that we only ask the question once, like what the gross floor square area of the building is, we just ask it one time and we don't ask again, or we have it auto fill the second time it appears so that we don't. But it seems if they're entering information, maybe we just need to only ask them once for some of this information. Then before we were asking people to submit stuff electronically separately, but now obviously everything has to be submitted electronically. So a lot of this now is just sort of general guidance in terms of what they're going to be asked to provide so we can sort of clean this up. So we have a similar thing for variances, which looks at the design review, special permit checklist. Oh, that's the regulations, various checklist. Yeah, so I think if we go through and sort of we can combine a bunch of these things into something that I can, Pat, you and I can work on that. I'm coming up with a plan for that. There are a couple other ones I just want to bring our attention to. One, which I've already started doing, the special permit conditions, standard condition number two, it had gendered language. So as I've been reading it, I've been editing it. And changing the he is to they are and that he determines to they determine. That's the only bit of gendered language that we have in here. So I just wanted to pull that out. I'm just going to sort of do that going forward. And I had started pulling together an application for an appeal, but I'm not sure we necessarily need to have, Pat, you and I had talked a little bit about this earlier. Typically when people are appealing, they're filing a lawsuit more. So we don't really need an application. And I had put together sort of the appeal procedure, but the more I wrote into this, the more I got concerned that if something changes in state law or something changes that the town and we don't catch it here, like where is that going to be a problem?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 606</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. I sort of think, I don't think, I mean, I don't think that is in itself a problem because the state does not change the zoning rate, the 40A very often. And if there's an amendment to section 15, we'll know about it. Mr. Cunningham will probably bang us over the head about it. So I don't think that, this isn't the sort of thing where little regulations happen from time to time and you have to be constantly watching the, watching to make sure you catch them. We'll sort of get that. I think that there is another problem though, in that it's, that kind of means that I think that we need to do some more thinking about that. In the draft that we have here, we have a partial statement of section eight, which is where the appeal authority comes from. But, and the actual language is more, is murkier than the part that we quote here. And it involves other kinds of, it potentially involves other kinds of actions by the zoning administrator or not the zoning administrator, but by ISD than just the ones that are indicated here. I mean, just recently, for example, we have had occasions where someone is attempting to appeal the grant of a building permit to somebody else. And that doesn't really, that certainly doesn't fit from the language that you can appeal failure to obtain the building permit. And none of the people who do that actually go through the procedure that you'd expect when it comes to requesting an enforcement action. And that puts us in a situation where we're kind of improvising the procedures as we go along. So some of this is very, very specific about what has to be where and so on, because section 15 is very specific. And some of it is a little bit non-specific. And I think we need to figure out as, I think we're going to be seeing more of this. And I think that we need to kind of work on figuring out what we think the actual procedure is. The board may remember in some earlier cases, we've had appeals where the timeliness is a question as it often is. And the difficulty is, is that we don't have a formal procedure that necessarily produces a paper that says, this is a final decision. You have 30 days to appeal. So you get a stream of correspondence and ISD, often way after the opportunity to appeal is over saying, well, the letter on August 8th, 2022 should have told them that they were marking up the wrong tree. And that's where it starts. And the other people say, no, this was just back and forth as we were trying to work our way through this. And that's not a denial at all. So you need to know, just in fairness, we need to have some way of being sure what the starting gun is for any of these things. And there are procedures in state law that we haven't really focused in on a lot. But I think that this is one of those things where it's not a matter where we know exactly what we're supposed to do. And it's a matter of explaining it clearly. This is a matter where we need to have some help probably from Mr. Cunningham and spend some time thinking about what the various possibilities are and how we can sort of guide people into doing it. So I'll just stop there. Cause I don't know the answer to all these questions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 157</summary>

> Okay. Mr. Cunningham has his hand up. Please. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Yeah, I agree with Mr. Hamm that I would like to be involved, especially in this portion of these public materials. I think it's good that the board wants to provide some guidance to the public and be helpful in terms of all processes, including the appeal procedure. However, to the extent that there are some items that might be a bit ambiguous or gray, issues like timing, which can vary based on the factual circumstances of cases, the board wants to be careful not to drift into areas of legal guidance rather than just strict timing mechanisms or just general guidelines. I think that we'd want to make sure that, the board would want to make sure that those guys, that whatever is out there for especially the appeal procedure does not drift too far into, or anywhere near legal guidance for public person.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 501</summary>

> Yeah, point well taken. Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Dupont. So at the risk of sounding like I'm making a joke, I mean, you can always put language in the saying, any questions that you have about your legal rights in this regard, should be, you can refer to an attorney or something along those lines. I think that that's sort of standard contractual language, which might also fit in here somewhere, just telling them that if they do, and then that may even underscore Mr. Cunningham's point that we're not giving them legal advice, that should they want legal advice, they've got to go elsewhere. The other thing I wanted to point out, and this may be a bit nitpicky, but it also refers to this application, the appeal, as well as the requests for variants and for special permit. For clarity's sake, I think what these are is, this is entitled an appeal to the permit granting authority. I don't think that's what it is. I think it's an application for an appeal. And I think that one way or the other, this needs to be consistent and clear, because when you go down to the third paragraph, it says this application for appeal, number one, so you're referring to it as an application. I think it's important for people to be able to look at it and say, well, what's the application. Oh, this is what it is. And then when you get on to the second page. In number two, it says this, the application. And copy of the order. Or decision. And then three says a copy of the certified application. And if I'm in four, actually also refers to application. As does five. So I think it's important for people to be able to look at it and say, well, what's the application? Oh, this is what it is. So I don't know if you'd call it an application for an appeal or appeal to the permit granting authority application. But I think it's, it would help. At least from my point of view for consistency. To understand what we're referring to when we call later on in the discussion. So I think it's important for people to be able to look at it and say, well, what's the application? Oh, this is what it is. And then number three for the zoning for the variance in the special permit. Which are entitled requests, which seems. A bit. Vague to me because it's not really a request either. It's really an application for. And, you know, again, maybe I'm being a bit nitpicky and everybody knows what they are and what they mean. But I think it's important for people to be able to look at it and say, well, what's the application? And then number four. The file names are application for a special permit. Application for appeal and application for variance. So, you know, Just. Just a matter of clarity from where I'm sitting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 398</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I think it's important for people to be able to look at it and say, well, what's the application? Because I think that's what's. That's what the zoning bylaw itself uses. With respect to. Appeals. I think it's different. The appeal actually is the application here. If you, the. Ultimately the provision that allows for these appeals is section eight of chapter 48. And. The. The. The text of the section. Yeah, is, is also. Speaks in that language. So by, by the same token that. That Mr. Joplin's argument is, I think we should be sticking with the language that's used in section eight. And that is. Section 1.3, which says an appeal to the board of appeals. May be taken by any person aggrieved due to inability to obtain a permit. Or enforcement action from the building inspector as provided in section eight. So. We got to be, I think. Sticking with. With that language. I don't know. I don't know. As anybody looking at this would immediately know. The question of who a person aggrieved is, is not necessarily a trivial question either, but that's getting more into understanding how far one goes. I do think that. That it would be. It might be helpful if we are doing something along these lines. Two. What is to make it clear that. The. The. The. The. The ultimate authority here is, is. Section. Section eight. For part of it, but section 15. Which sets forth the. Precise procedures and. If there's any difference between what we happen to have and what, and what section 15 is requires. Okay. So that, that point is taken, if I may respond, but I just think that. Third paragraph where it says this application for appeal. I just. You know, I'm not clear that a lay person necessarily reading this knows. You know that this document is the appeal. I mean, maybe they do, maybe they don't, but it's clearly an application. I don't know. I don't think it's necessarily. I don't think it's something that it seems a bit inconsistent to me. When you read the document, I don't think it's necessarily. Internally coherent, unless you say very clearly that this. Is an application for the appeal. And I suppose it does that in this application for appeal. So I'll just leave it at that.

> Okay. In the background here, going to the zoning board website. Clicking on the. Online. Portal. Cause I couldn't recall. Okay. You can apply for variance. You can apply for a special permit. You cannot apply online. And appeal. Similarly, you cannot apply for comprehensive permit online. Okay. Well, we can look more into the. Into this question, but certainly the other two applications, I don't know if you've seen them. I don't know if you've seen them. Basically been superseded by the online procedure. Except that we can cannibalize the language for. Guidelines. The other thing I did want to look at was. Our regulations. Which are now. Been around for a few years. So. Basic. Stuff at the front. Hasn't changed at all. Application procedures. This application process section. I think it's something that we would. Once we have a doc, a guide document in place, we can. Either address it all in that document or we need to address. It all in that document. So. What we have now is no longer correct. But I can review this a little more with, with Colleen offline. And then we can. Come back to it. The coordination with other boards. Pre-hearing process. A lot of this is just capitalization things. Okay. Cool. Colleen does everyone now submit their fees online or do some people still come in and bring a check? There is an option to bring it in. But most times. Credit cards or e-checks. Okay. Okay. Okay. There's one thing that has happened before is that people. They write a check. And it's included in the pack. The photocopy is made and included in the package as a proof of having paid. And the routing number and check number and the. Account number are not redacted. And then. It is just all to that number. Okay. The information is captured in the application. So you could find it. See what check number and what date they paid. But it won't be public. Yeah. No, it, it, it usually happens in comprehensive permit application packages. That's where. I've seen it. So it's more of the applicant doing it to themselves. Okay. And then we did have a section in here on the preparation of the planning memorandum, which is no longer happening. So I was proposing to call it a preparation of zoning guidance letter. Is a building. Inspector designate. It shall provide a letter to the board, outlining the request or request and indicated the sections of the zoning bylaw. Requiring action by the board. And that's something that. That Mike has been do Mike and Colleen have been putting together. And that's what we're doing now. So just want to make that change. Cause we're no longer getting a memorandum from the planning department. And as best as I could tell, this was the only place that I. It was required. And. Under adherence to the decorum. So just. Pulling that. Anything else I assume is fine. And once I've got. We've gone through this. Obviously Michael send a copy. Just a legal department for review. A couple more capitalizations. So one thing I withdraw that this came up tonight. And that's. 48 hour rules. An applicant withdrawing. More than 48 hours before. It's withdrawn without prejudice, but the applicant may further withdraw the application does before the board up until the time they vote. But this shall. It says in our stuff shall result in the forfeiture of all fees. Which would be a. I don't know. Does anybody. Have any. Care one way or another, if we leave the word shall, or should we change it to Maine? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I. I think that we probably should say may. And my reason for it is that. Frequently the withdrawal of the application is something that is. It's something that is. It's something that is. It's providing the relief that they needed and they didn't need to. Leave something in there for us to deny, and then to be feeling later on with the notion that the board has taken an adverse action. And. But, you know, occasionally we do. When people withdraw an application. And. We're having rights to come back to us. When something is not very ripe. And I know this happens with some of Mr. In essence cases in particular. And where it's in our interest for that, they do that as well as their own interests. And we. You know, in order to make it all work better, we, we do sometimes waive fees. So I, I. You know, I don't know if it's a good idea to do that. And. But nobody should count on the fee being waived. Right. And are we the arbiters of waving or not? I don't remember ever having a discussion. Where that came up where somebody withdrew. We sometimes had the question about. You know, if we're not returning their money. And. And I think we've sort of decided in the past that we, if we say it's with prejudice that we're not returning their money. Mr. Cunningham.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 60</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. In response to Mr. DuPont's question, I would interpret this as yes. The board is the arbiter. And I agree with Mr. DuPont. That the board is the arbiter. And that the board. Protects the board's discretion and it's. In instances where it wants to. Require that the fees be forfeited, but not require it to.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 69</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Yeah. If I may, just to emphasize is that I don't remember a Ken occasion where we said. You can withdraw it and we'll. You know, there's a feature that you can withdraw it. And you can file it without, without. Putting you can refile it later on. Without paying the fees again. And that has come up. I can recall several cases where we've done that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 154</summary>

> Yeah, I think, I think that's more correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't see. So like in the case of. The one we saw her tonight, Dorothy road. They did a variance and a special permit. And then the new system that would charge them $400 each. And they just thought it was one application for hearing. And then they just said, no, no, no. We're not going to charge you for each. Application. You will be paying. For both. Or is that not a rule? I hope it's not a rule. Because the new system will charge them for each application. In the past, there've been a lot of people who asked why they have to pay twice for one hearing. So. That's a good question. So. The. Town to. I guess the town would have to reimburse them that $400. If that was the case.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 78</summary>

> Right. There's not wave. There's not a way to just wave it. There is in the system. I don't have the authority, but. Mike does. He could wave one of them. If you want it to. Okay. I just, I don't know if that's something that. I don't know. Is that a standard practice? Or is that standard practice? They pay for each application and then. That's just how they pay. I'll be honest. I have no idea.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 226</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. What bothers me a little bit about this is that, you know, the. The ISD is not necessarily. Asking us to do any more. That or the ISD actually to do any more. It's strictly the legal accident is to whether or not they need a variance or a special permit. We have many special permit. Issue cases, which have substantial issues. And they can be easily as expensive. The notion. The notion that. That because they're two separate. Legal. It was two separate legal authorities. That that should. That should necessarily correlate with how much work. It is done with. The town's actual cost of. Processing the application doesn't seem right to me. And, you know, to the point where I can think of some constitutional cases that raise. A question as to whether or not something like that as a proper fee, if, if it's not. Reasonably. Related to the town's cost of processing the application. So I would think that the normal rule is that if they're applying for relief, the fact that they. Includes that some of the relief may be for a permanent. Or variance should. It should not affect the amount that's charged. That said, I'm not sure that that's within our wheelhouse anyway, but. It does seem unfair to me. To do that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 165</summary>

> Yeah, I guess we should find out what the standard. Correct. So I know what the. Colleague, you sister was a standard practices. Now that we're online. I'm curious what the practice was before. For the most part. It kind of depended on who took the application in. Some people at the front desk would take a check breach. And others would take one check. And. I didn't always go back for the second check on people when they did one, because most times when I said it. They were like, no, it's one hearing. Why should I pay for two? Right. Okay. Is the. For the book for you. When you are. Like doing the advertising. Do you have to advertise the special permit and the variance separately, or do you have to. Do you have to pay. 80 to three, something to do a regular. One. You add the variance, the extra words or letters. Make it more like three 40. To advertise.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 141</summary>

> Okay. Okay. We can. Discuss what that should be. Once we begin doing this, we could, if we were really going after money. Say that if you. If you were doing it all on one notice, would that increase the length of the notice? Yes, absolutely. That that also would increase the length of the notice and would therefore increase the cost. All right. Yeah, as long as we're doing it all on one legal notice with two, Separate. Right. So I guess it's more that if the application for the special perm, the variance happens at the same time, it's one thing. But if they happen at separate times, then it needs to be something different. Right. You'll have to figure out how to try to make that work. The chair will note, I remember one case in which you're.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 150</summary>

> Mr. Chairman. I remember one case up on Highland Street, which had a special permit and a variance that actually were, instead of being all consolidated into one thing, were actually processed as if they were two entirely separate applications. And we ended up granting one and not the other. And we never heard them both on the same night, as I can recall. One night was the special permit one, and another night was the variance one. There, it does seem to me appropriate. I mean, in some ways, the applicants who say, wait a minute, there's one hearing. As long as it's only one hearing, why am I paying two fees, is sort of showing that sometimes it's mostly it's all one hearing, but occasionally it's not. Right. And in that case, specifically, the variance had absolutely nothing to do with the special permit. They were completely separate.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 87</summary>

> Right. I'll talk to Mike Champa about that, too, if you want, what he thinks. So the rest of this, I can revise and get back out to the board if there's any more questions, and then run it by Mr. Cunningham, as well. Yeah, because I walked through all those. OK. Now, were there any other? So the only other, so that was it, I think, for our documents. Are there any other questions about sort of the documentation we have or things that we need?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 184</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, this is really more meta than that. But I would very much like, after a certain decent interval, say nine months after we do this, to try to figure out some way, like all of the businesses that we relate to, of getting surveys back and getting a sense of what it looks like from the point of view of the people who are doing applications, how easy this is to work with, where people have problems, if they do have problems, and so forth, to get some feedback, basically, from the customers, so to speak, to see whether or not this is working in the way in which we intend to facilitate the applications and make everything work more smoothly, both from our point of view and from that of the public. We'll certainly try to figure out how to do that. I know we've brought that up in the past. We haven't done much on it. Mr. Chairman? Yeah, no, especially now that we've got a whole new system, that might be helpful. Mr. Moore, did you have a question?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 132</summary>

> I was just thinking that you could, upon granting of a permit for a variance, I'm sorry, an appeal of a permit on variance or whatever, you could either make that request or make that a requirement. There's no reason you can't add that as a condition, return of a survey on process, and it would have to be kind of a standardized thing that everyone had to do. But you might want to, I know force is the wrong word, but you might want to make sure that happens, because a bunch of months later, their memories are not going to be particularly clear. You want to get them, having just gone through the process, what their views are on the process. So that might be helpful. Thank you. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Colleen Ralston? - 82</summary>

> Mr. Chair?  Yeah. A lot, a lot of the people that we have done stuff with this past year sent emails, and I could forward them. Most of them thanked the board, thanked the process, glad that everything's happened so well. And so I haven't been forwarding them one at a time to everybody, but I'm more than happy to if they want to see them. I can probably go back and find quite a few of them from this year.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 78</summary>

> Yeah, that would certainly be helpful, especially if they have any pointers on anything. OK. Then the last thing I wanted to talk briefly about tonight. So the town meeting warrant is going to open in January. And the process for that starts now in terms of the board starting to talk about what they want to, what they might want to include, if there are any changes to the bylaws. And so Mr. Cunningham, hand up fast.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 14</summary>

> Sorry, Mr. Chair. The warrant actually opens in December. I believe it's December 8th.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 406</summary>

> Oh, it does. It closes in December 8th. OK. So at the time that we were doing the Mount Vernon Street case, there was the whole question about whether the difference between a building being attached and detached, and that sort of there being a gap, quite literally, in the bylaw between the two. And we had flagged that as something we thought that the ARB should look at. The ARB deferred past the fall, because the fall was already pretty busy. But I've asked them to reconsider this, and possibly some other things. So the chair of the ARB asked if I could put together a list and come and talk to the ARB about it. So I had a few different items that I wanted to put out there and see if there were other ones the board thought might be helpful. So the first one was that question of attached versus detached, and trying to make a little more consistency in that. The second one I had flagged is in the section of the bylaw on accessory dwelling units. It's the only place in the bylaw where there are bullets, and things are not lettered. And it gets difficult to refer to, oh, it's in 592B1 bullet 3 sub A, or something. So asking them to possibly re-letter that section, so that it makes more sense. And then subsequent to that, I had asked them to come up the average setback exception to the minimum front yards. So that section is written that it includes the word vacant lots. So it sort of implies that if you have a lot that's already developed, that it wouldn't apply. So I just want to clarify from the ARB whether that's the intent, or whether it's supposed to apply to all cases. So that's something that I wanted them to look at as well. And then I wanted to see if they had written back and said that they're going to be looking at the Arlington Heights Business Overlay District as something they're looking at for the spring. But I wanted to see if there were any other things that the board, the members of the board have sort of come across in their research on the zoning bylaws, or in our work here on the board. If there's anything else they think that deserve the ARB's attention in terms of reconsidering in the zoning bylaw.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 63</summary>

> The other one that I'd mentioned to them is the residential parking guideline, residential parking section is a horror show. I'm not entirely sure if we're going to get to that this cycle, but it's definitely something that needs some serious consideration. If there's any other sections of the zoning bylaw that people think are in need of assistance. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 233</summary>

> I don't think this is quite ready yet, but in recent cases on a couple of occasions, we've had our attention directed to the flood, the flooding provision of the bylaw. And which seems to me to have been drafted at a point where we may not have had a sufficiently robust wetlands bylaw, and the Conservation Commission may not have had the capabilities that it has today. After an issue has been decided as it was recently by the Conservation Commission to be sort of saying, well, that's okay for them, but the zoning bylaw is quite different and you have to do something else. Eventually, those things all have to come together to support a single policy towards flooding and wetlands. And actually, I think in most respects, the Conservation Commission is a more capable body to do that than we are. And I would like to see some thought, maybe given through joint work between the two commissions to come up with something that more clearly delineates whose responsibility is which and avoids the possibility of applicants or others attempting to turn one body against the other by interpreting them without reference to one another. I don't know. I have no idea what the answer to that is, but it just doesn't seem like it's a structure that is up to date or that is conducive to an effective program.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 33</summary>

> Yeah. And so that would be 57, which is the floodplain district and 58, which is the inland wetland district. Right. Both sort of in that same category. Right. Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Roger Dupont - 544</summary>

> So very briefly, and again, not to be too nitpicky, And I think Mr. Hanlon has addressed this. Correctly before, when we talk about the accessory dwelling units and the reference to. You can have an accessory dwelling unit. And if it's within six feet of the lot line, then you can. Have it allowed by a special permit. However, the way it's worded seems to me to be. That it's not. If the building is located. It almost suggests that it already exists. And I know we did have this. Conversation a little bit, and I don't think that it makes sense to deny something because you want to build a new accessory building. But I would just point out that if you go into the zoning bylaw. And it clearly says, you know, that there are side yard and rear yard setback requirements. So six feet. Yeah. Now, if you then go to. 5.4.2. B seven where it's the garages and it says they don't. They don't. Private detached garages need not conform to a side yard. And. You know, there's also a requirement for a rear yard setback. So we know that despite what it says in those. Open space record yard and open space requirements. That there is the exception to build a garage, right? So we have that. That's there. So you could go build a garage. And. I think we talked about this before you, you shouldn't necessarily have to engage in a ploy where. You know, there is a requirement for a rear yard setback. And there is a requirement for a side yard setback. However, I don't think that the language may be as clear enough in. 5.9.2. The bullet point. One, two, three, four. Two, three, five. I do think that, you know, we could tidy that up somehow. I don't know. I don't know what the best language is for that. But, you know, Also in the. District yard and open space requirements. It's got just above that. It says C 0.5 0.4 0.2. You could also include in there plus 5.9 0.2. As an exception as well. And sort of just try to tie it all together. So. I don't know. I just thought of it from the perspective of somebody who is looking at this for the first time. And they started out with the, you know, the yard. Setback requirements. You might come away, not realizing that if you want to build an 80, you. You're allowed to do it. And again, You know, without belaboring the point. So maybe something could be done to tie it all together. I don't know. I just thought of it from the perspective of somebody who is looking at this for the first time. And they started out with the, you know, the yard. Setback requirements. You might come away, not realizing that if you want to build an 80, you. You're allowed to do it. And again, You know, without belaboring the point. I don't know. I just thought of it from the perspective of somebody who is looking at this for the first time. And again, you know, without belaboring the point. So maybe something could be done to tidy up 5.9.2.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 12</summary>

> Okay. Any other thoughts?  Mr. Cunningham has got his hand up.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham - 45</summary>

> Okay. Just for clarification on the timeline. The warrant for the 2024 annual town meeting opens on December eighth. And closes on January 26th. And I'm happy to serve as a resource for the board. On any of the issues discussed tonight or any others.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 82</summary>

> Okay, great. Thank you very much. Yeah. So the. The ZBA is not allowed to put things on the. The ZBA is not allowed to put things on the ZBA. So we're going to have to go through the ARV or through the select board or. Or attend 10 voter signatures. So. Right. It's the easier way to go. All right. Well, if anybody has any other ideas, let me know. All right. We'll try to figure that one out. Mr. Moore.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 192</summary>

> Thank you. Has there ever been consideration by either your board or the ARV? More likely. And appropriately there be. A consideration of. Safe Harbor guidelines for. The zoning regulations. And I don't mean zoning as a regulation type. I mean, specific. Aspects of the zoning regulation. I've noticed that. Now we're getting annual. I don't know. Annual desires to change. The regulations year after year. And. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. On a regular basis. And I just. It might make sense for the ARB to consider some sort of safe Harbor guidelines to put that off. So it can't happen annually. Maybe every other year to reconsider certain things. And I know that's a little bit beyond your purview. So, but this just occurred to me when. I'm not sure. I'm not sure where things might've gotten voted down or sideways or whatever, that they necessarily should be taken up again. Next year. Maybe the year after or something like that. Just, just a thought. I know it's sort of outside the. It's outside the box a little bit of what we're talking about. Sorry. Mr.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Cunningham and Christian Klein - 187</summary>

> Mr. Cunningham. I have a question. And I'd like to know whether Mr. Cunningham agrees with it is. Is that if, if an adverse action is taken by town meeting, then it can't come back to town meeting. For a certain period of time. I've forgotten exactly what it is. Unless the. ARB allows it to come back. Is that. Basically right. Mr. Cunningham. I don't think it's a safe harbor. A safe harbor. Pursuant to adverse action that can't be brought up immediately. It might be three years or two. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chair. That sounds like it already is in place. Thank you. Okay. There it goes. All right. Think of that. So, yeah. So if anybody has anything else they want. They think I should discuss with the RV, just, just send me an email. Let me know. So with that, that is everything we had on our. Okay. Oh, Oh, Mr. Chair. An additional comment. Mr. Moore. I'd like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Cunningham on his ascension to the. Yeah. Council seats in a. A permanent kind of fashion.

> And that's all. Thank you. Thank you. agenda for tonight. The next meeting of the board is scheduled for Tuesday, November 28th at 7.30pm. We now are down to two items on our docket for that night. One is the continuation of 212 Pleasant Street and the other is a new hearing for 54 Mary Street. And in addition, I'm assuming we also have a vote on the decision in regards to the case we heard this evening on Dorothy Road. So unless there is any other business that anyone on the board would like to bring forward, I'll go ahead and close the meeting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 91</summary>

> Mr. Chair, just real quick. The appeal of the building inspector that was on the online agenda that's no longer on our agenda for the next meeting. So we had talked about this briefly at the start. The appeal was to the issuance of a building permit by another party. That other party has requested that the building permit be withdrawn. And so we are figuring out exactly how to handle this as a matter, but it is our understanding that it will not come before the board on the 28th.
</details>
