</details><details><summary>Detail the proposal for 40-42 Dorothy Road.</summary>

> The proposal for 40-42 Dorothy Road is to replace an existing garage with a two-story accessory dwelling unit (ADU). The ADU is designed to be a net-zero, all-electric unit, providing an affordable housing option. The project is a partnership between the Housing Corporation of Arlington and Reframe Systems, a company specializing in modern modular units. The proposed ADU will be located in the same area as the current garage, but will be narrower, longer, and slightly taller. The unit will be a single unit of affordable housing. The project is still in the early stages of design, with plans to include skirting around the unit to prevent exposure to debris or wildlife. The hearing for the proposal has been continued to November 14th, 2023.

2. Parking: There were concerns about the adequacy of parking spaces. Some neighbors mentioned that the current parking situation is already problematic and the proposed addition could exacerbate the issue.

3. Impact on Views and Sunlight: Some neighbors were worried that the proposed addition would block their views and sunlight, impacting their quality of life and potentially the value of their properties.

</details><details><summary>List the pros and cons of allowing an accessory dwelling unit to be built directly on a property line.</summary>
