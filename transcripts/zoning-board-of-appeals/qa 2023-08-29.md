> The Pleasant Street project involves a proposed addition to a property at 212 Pleasant Street. The homeowners, Nellie Aikenhead and her husband, are seeking a special permit for relief from the two and a half story rule found in the dimensional and density table of section 5.4.2. The addition is planned for the rear of the house to accommodate their growing family. 

The discussion involved several speakers:

1. Christian Klein, the chair of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals, who outlined the meeting's agenda and explained the memo released by Inspectional Services regarding the average grade elevation of the property.

2. Nellie Aikenhead, the homeowner, who requested a continuance to better understand the new information provided by Inspectional Services.

3. Patrick Hanlon, a member of the Zoning Board of Appeals, who agreed with the continuance as long as the applicant was consenting.

4. Attorney Sarah Radigan, who represented the neighboring property owners at 214 Pleasant Street, Miss Sabrina Howe, and Mr. John Garber. She raised procedural questions about the status of the matter and requested that the board ask the applicant to provide more detailed information on their proposed site plan.

The proposed changes to the property include a basement foundation, first floor, and second floor addition at the rear of the house. However, due to the new information provided by Inspectional Services, which calculated the average grade elevation differently, the homeowners requested a continuance to evaluate this new information.
