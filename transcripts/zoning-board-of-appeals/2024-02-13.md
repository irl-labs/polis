<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 64</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with that, I will reopen the hearing for docket 3779 9 Morton Road. We continued this at the end of last hearing because there were some questions for the applicant in regards to what they were proposing for an accessory dwelling unit at the rear of their property. So if they could address the board and let us know where they stand today.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kate and Anthony Gregorio - 183</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi everyone. Nice to see you again. I'm Kate Gregorio and my husband Anthony. Great to see you. Thank you for the time. We at this point would just like to ask for continuance. We are sort of going a little bit back to the drawing board on our end given all the feedback and the considerations we now have a full picture of. And so we will look to be in communication with Colleen about the plans as they develop. We are going to start working with a general contractor to develop some blueprints and we'll be able to bring those to the board with us next time we see you. Okay. So we're happy to continue. We do need to continue to a specific date. So I wasn't sure if you had a sense as to how much time you would be looking for. Maybe not the next meeting but the one after that would be a good enough time for us to sort of get things going. So March 12th would be a month from now. That would be great.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 138</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Are there any questions from the board? With that I would accept a motion to continue the hearing for 9 Morton Road to Tuesday March 12th, 2024 at 7.30 p.m. Mr. Chairman so moved. Thank you Mr. Hanlon. A second. Second. Thank you Mr. LeBlanc. So there's a vote of the board to continue the hearing for 9 Morton Road to Tuesday March 12th, 2024 at 7.30 p.m. Roger Dupont.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 143</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that we've moved to the next item we're taking up on the agenda which is docket 377811 Ronald Road. So there is a letter in the in Novus posted to the town in regards to this application. Upon further review of the application between the town and the applicant has been determined that a special permit is not required for the work that they are proposing to do and therefore they do not need relief from this board and so they have requested that their application be withdrawn. Unfortunately the request was it was the determination was made within 48 hours of our hearing so it was not able to be just withdrawn administratively so the board does need to vote. So the chair would accept a motion to withdraw the variance request for 9 Morton Road. Excuse me 11 Ronald Road.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 32</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christian. Yes. I'm one of the neighbors to Catherine and there was no specifics as to what the variance or what she is exactly applying for. Could you give me some clarification?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 111</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure I'd be happy to. So the the applicant at 11 Ronald Road they had done a bunch of landscaping at the front. They currently have a set of stairs leading up to an entrance at the first floor. They're proposing to remove that structure and replace it with a deck at the level of their first floor at the front of the house. The deck does not extend more than 10 feet from the foundation line and it is not covered and therefore under the zoning bylaws it does not require a special permit. It can be built by right and so that is what they're going to be constructing.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 6</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay thank you for the clarification.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 89</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you're very welcome. Thank you for asking the question. So again so this is a the chair would accept a motion to accept the withdrawal of the special permit request for 11 Ronald Road. Mr. Chairman so moved. Thank you Mr. Hanlon. Thank you Mr. DuPont. So vote of the board. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Hanlon. Aye. Mr. McCauley. Aye. Mr. Riccardelli is not present. Ms. Hoffman. Aye. Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. And the chair votes aye. So the special permit request for 11 Ronald Road has been withdrawn.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 44</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so that brings us to docket 378253 Lansdowne Road. There's a continuance of a prior hearing which we heard at our January 23rd meeting and so with that I would ask the applicants to reintroduce themselves and tell us where we are today.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Bill Nolan - 219</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi good evening Mr. Chair. Can everybody hear me fine? We can. Great thank you. My name is Bill Nolan from Savoy Nolan Architects. I'm here representing Becca and Tim Center the owners of the property. Also with us today we have David Crispin who is our land surveyor and civil engineer and Russ Busa is our contractor. So we received so I just wanted to inform the board that we have changed directions with regards to our our hardship and Becca has a prepared a presentation for you which she will do but we also wanted to address a comment that was sent to us by Colleen in the interim between the last meeting and this meeting regarding the status of the lots whether they are separate together. So Dave Crispin sent a letter to Colleen. I sent it to her to her email and not through the portal so I think she got it late but she did end up getting it yesterday. Hopefully that was passed on to you guys but Dave's here to kind of explain in a little bit more detail and I think Becca actually has some information as well. She spoke with her real estate attorney so Dave if you're here you want to address the lot issue please. I am here.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 20</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for the record that the letter was received and it was posted to Novus so it is available online.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dave Crispin - 213</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great thank you. Good evening. I don't want to take a lot of your time up with this. I've been doing this for a long time and I believe the board would be more than familiar with the merger doctrine. This is pretty well documented and basically what that says is if a lot has 5,000 square feet and 50 feet of frontage if it's located in a single resident zone and if it was created conforming to zoning at the time all those questions are yes and if it was not if it was if it was not separately held in this case we have two lots two parcels side by side that have been in common ownership for 78 years. The house was built in 40 and in fact the house that's standing there now is about four feet onto one of the second parcels. So in my mind these lots or parcels are clearly one lot for zoning purposes and should be treated as such and that's basically what my letter said. Just another comment because assessor's maps are commonly misunderstood with this. Assessor's maps are only intended for assessment purposes only. We can talk about this a little more if you like but that's that's my story. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any questions from the board specifically in relation to that letter?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 242</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman? Mr. Hanlon. I just wondered if what Mr. Buzza has to say about the zoning bylaws definition of a lot because at least one of the cases that is cited by the DHCD memorandum that is summarized at length in in his letter emphasizes that the general rule is that you don't look at the title unless and they've had the official way in which this is put in the record books unless the zoning ordinance or the zoning bylaw so requires. And in that particular case they went into the whole issue depended upon interpretation of the local bylaw. Our bylaw says a lot is an area or parcel of land or any part thereof not including water area in common ownership designated on a plan filed with the inspector of buildings by its owner or owners as a separate lot and having boundaries identical with those recorded in the Middlesex County Registry of Deeds. And that's a little bit murky. It's not quite like saying the lot is exactly what is treated as one lot in the registry of deeds but it's not the very general language that is in the that is in the in section 40a. And as I say some of the cases seem to indicate that the language of the local bylaw is important and I wonder if Mr. Busa has a view on how it is that we should be interpreting the town's bylaw.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dave Crispin - 67</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Crispin speaking again. I'm sorry I've made a mistake. That's okay. I really don't see any difference between what you just read and what the state right law says. And the key word there is common ownership. This parcel has been in common ownership for 78 years. The building is on both of the lots at the same time. For zoning purposes this is one lot.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 25</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess Mike what I'd like you to address is the language having boundaries identical with those recorded in the Middlesex County Registry of Deeds.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 26</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has exactly that. This is registered land actually. These parcels are exactly precisely as you recorded on registry and those two parcels comprise one lot.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 58</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. So you're basically your interpretation is that there's no deviation. The fact that the boundaries are what they are and treating them as one lot as opposed to two doesn't have anything to do with the language about the boundaries being identical because there's no deviation. It's just that you're amalgamating them. Is that basically right?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 10</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's one way of putting it I guess yeah. Okay.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rebecca Senter - 141</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was sorry just to speak. This is Becca Senter. I also did some research on this. I talked to the real estate attorney who helped us close on the property originally and his interpretation is that even though they're listed as two parcels we have one deed and there's nothing legally that we would even need to do to officially combine them because they are already as such. And then I also talked to the tax assessor in Arlington and their opinion was that they're one lot and we have two real estate bills because they're two parcels but we could very easily combine them with a simple letter asking the town to do so and are happy to do so. But there was nothing that indicated that they were two different lots. And the two bills is not uncommon.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 71</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything further Mr. Hanlon? No I guess I'm feeling a little better from what Ms. Senter said because anything that is simply a matter of they're going through a formality in order to create something that is exactly what is required seems to me to be close enough to take this issue out of the case and get us on to what qualifies for a variance. So I'm okay with this.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 135</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay are there any questions from any of the other board members at this stage? If not, okay. So then this returns us back to with the initial question which is that this is a request for a variance because the applicant is requesting that the proposed structure extend into the front setback which would not otherwise be allowed to do. And this is an issue because this is a existing home is intended to be completely removed and a new structure created in its place. So this is being treated as a new structure rather than as a renovation. Correct, yes. So with that I think Becca has prepared a presentation for you guys. So I'll hand it over to her. Okay. Colleen can you go ahead and give her permission to share? Sure.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rebecca Senter - 2687</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And everyone see my screen. Yes, okay, excellent. So, thank you all for the opportunity to continue this discussion. We definitely took the key points from our previous discussion to heart and add some internal discussions in the interim time between the last meeting this meeting. Um, and are here to present what hopefully is a bit clearer of a definition for why we are requesting a variance to our front setback at 53 lands down. And please stop me if you have any questions as we. Move through this, and so I thought maybe I would start by just giving you a bird's eye view of what we, what our property is like on lines down road, because I think a lot of that goes into why we are, in fact, having this discussion today. And so our lot at 53 lands down road is 110 feet. Uh, but long by 64 feet deep, we are in zoning district are 1, where we currently have a single family home, which, as you can see in this. This image here is on the north side of the property. Our current house has a front setback of 9 feet and 2 inches. The South side of the property, which is here, we currently use as our backyard and open space. Our son Luke plays here all the time. And as you can see on lands down road, which is here in this image here. Our lot here is at 53. this is consistent with our neighbor who is at 57 lands down road where we have our houses situated on 1 side of our property. And we use our side yard, essentially as our backyard specifically, because both of our lots are quite shallow. 1 of the things that's important to note about land down road is that it actually is a relatively steep Hill. And so you drive up the road up this deep Hill, and it begins cresting at the top and terminates in a dead end. The Hill crest sort of in line with our neighbor at 57. so we're still significantly on Hill here at 53. This actually creates some unique topography to our particular lot. And so, with this image here, which hopefully just demonstrates a bit more now compared to our last conversation, the part of the law, which is the South side over here. Which we use as our open our open backyard space actually has a very steep grade. It's a greater than 8% rate, whereas the North side of the property, which is designated with this sort of hash red area here is a much flatter grade, less than 8%. And as you can see, that's where our current house fits. I assume that when it was built back in 1940, that's why it was built where it was, because that's the flat part of the house flat part of the lot. And so, when we were beginning the design process for this new construction home, we also decided that the best place to keep the house would be to keep it on the flat side of the lot, which is located over here. The reasons for that there are several, obviously, in order to achieve the scope of the house that we are hoping to get by doing this entire process, it made sense to keep it on this side. The other thing we considered was, because the current house is already situated on this side of the lot, keeping the new house in the same location would minimize construction site work burden, because there is already a toll there because we have foundation there. And the other thing that was important to us is that by keeping the house on this side of a lot, it would maintain our current neighborhood character and minimize disruption to our neighbors. Because, as we move to put in a new foundation and dig, the current house was already here, and so we're not starting from scratch and digging up an area that literally has never been dug up before. We understand that the zoning bylaws require our front setback to be 25 feet. However, our lot is only 64 feet deep. Therefore, if you take into account what we must maintain from a rear setback perspective, this gives us only 26.1 feet of usable depth for a new house, which is not very much. If we were required to do that, as you can imagine, the front setback being much further back than we're currently planning and accounting for a rear setback, we would be forced to build a very long and narrow house, which would likely take up the vast majority of our open lot in order to achieve the same square footage. So why are we here today? The reason we're here today is to request a variance to provide relief for this 25-foot setback regulation, which is set forth in 5.4.2 of the zoning bylaw in order to build a new construction house on our existing property. We understand after our conversation from the last meeting that there are three distinct criteria that must be met in order to be granted a variance. And we'll talk through each of these criteria in detail and how we believe that we satisfy these based on our currently designed plan. Obviously, criteria one is it must relate to the soil conditions, the shape, or the topography of the land in question. Criteria two is that a literal enforcement of this 25-foot bylaw would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise. And that criteria three, such relief, if granted, should not be without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the bylaw. And so we'll move on to each of these criteria in relation to this particular project. So criteria one, obviously, as you're all familiar, is that we must have a condition for hardship that relates to the soil conditions, the shape, or the topography of such land. I just want to note by bringing up this GIS map of our neighborhood that the majority of the houses on Lansdowne Road, so this is Lansdowne Road here, the majority of the houses on Lansdowne Road are unique lots that actually are oriented perpendicular to the road. So they have the narrow portion on facing Lansdowne Road, and the vast majority of their land runs deep away from the street. As you can see here, we are unique in that the long axis of our particular lot actually runs parallel to the road. And therefore, we are particularly impacted by being held to a 25-foot setback requirement because our lot is long here and very shallow here. Despite this and the fact that most of the lots on Lansdowne Road actually are quite deep, there are very few, if any, lots that actually have a setback that is 25 feet. In fact, the vast majority of the properties are much, much closer than that to the road. And so what we're faced with in our particular situation is not just that our lot is wide and shallow. It's the fact that it's the combination of the fact that our lot is very narrow in terms of depth, but also situated on a hill that would require us, if we were faced with having to maintain a 25-foot setback, would lead us to create this long and narrow house, which would extend a much larger portion of the house onto the very sloped region of our land, which is greater than 8% sloped. And in fact, the bylaws themselves recognize that sloped land greater than 8% is actually difficult topography to make use of. And so we believe that that really is our rationale for satisfying the criteria. One is that we're going to have to put a whole portion of this house onto a very steep piece of land if we need to maintain a 25-foot setback on our particularly shallow lot. In terms of criteria two, as I said, it's the combination of both the shape and the topography of our lot that results, that could result in the construction of a very long house on a sloped portion of our land. This would significantly increase the cost of the project. We would, in order to make that happen, we've talked through it as a team, significant additional fill would need to be brought on site in order to make the south side of the property, which currently is quite sloped, more level, because we need to ensure that the planned basement is not considered floor and in order to maintain the garage under the house, which is how it currently is situated and which would be in keeping with the design standards. It also should be noted that the current plan that we're proposing, which would leave the house on the north side of the property actually does not require additional fill to be brought on site. If we did need to make this long narrow house, retaining walls would need to be built likely along the entire south side of the property as well as the majority of the road facing side of the property in order to appropriately retain this fill. These would need to be constructed with appropriate reinforcement and as good neighbors, we would not want these walls to just be very stark concrete. We'd need to make them look aesthetically pleasing, which would add to some cost by adding stone facade. The cost difference for this alteration is estimated to be between 75 to 100,000 dollars above what our current construction estimate is, which we find unduly burdensome and honestly would go well beyond what we're financially able to support for the project. And then 3rd, obviously. We believe that the plan we proposed to you actually uses the land in the best way. We're keeping the house in the same location that it currently is, which minimizes changes to the site does not artificially change drainage and also maintains the look of the neighborhood. It's consistent with Arlington design standards, which is that our current, the house that we're proposing would have consistency with the current street elevation. In fact, our house would be the house that we're proposing actually moves it further back from the road, which means that closer in line with our neighbor at 57, if it was a 25 foot outlier, a 25 foot setback, it actually would be an outlier on the street because no one else is that far. A more condensed footprint, which is what we've designed actually leaves all this open space and allows for more natural light on site and in doing so also allows us to keep our garage under the house, which is desirable for off street parking consideration. We actually, in addition are improving the existing conditions of the property. We currently have a nonconforming North side setback, which is only 3.8 feet. From the property line closest to our neighbor at 57. We plan to correct this through the new construction. Additionally, and the point I want to note strongly is that the plan design actually improves the front setback from its current location. So, the current house is 9 feet, 2 inches from the road. The proposed house is 16 feet, 6 inches from the road with an 11 feet, 6 inch covered porch. This is very consistent with the rest of the street. And in addition, obviously, building a nicer house increases the surrounding property values. Our neighbors and the tax base for the town. And so. We, this is why we are requesting variance to provide relief for the 25 foot setback. Uh, regulation set forth in the zoning bylaw for this new construction. This is just a picture of what we're planning to build. You saw this last time. I think we all agreed that this is a really nice looking project. We'll maintain what the look of the houses in the area are it maintains open space that our kids can play in the yard and we believe that it is consistent with the purpose of the Arlington bylaws and then it does not negatively take away from the intent of those bylaws. And so the last thing that I would say. Is we also considered, obviously, I understand that. The board does not take lightly to granting variances. I understand that, and so we consider the scenario where. Uh, you don't feel comfortable granting this variance and so obviously, as we mentioned, building a long narrow house, which would take up. Almost all of our open space, it's not something that we feel comfortable doing. It would be an outlier in the neighborhood. I saw, and so we feel the most logical solution. Uh, if this variance isn't granted would be to develop a similar project in the same location, but we need to use the existing foundation to do so, which we feel is not ideal on several fronts, both for us as the owners, but also. To the neighborhood community, the current house, the existing foundation is concrete block, which is not used in today's building practices in order to build the house of the scope that we're looking to build. It would require additional reinforcing to support these additional levels. Our current basement height is quite low and we need additional structure to bring it into today's standards. As I mentioned, we have a garage, which is currently under the house. It's important for us to retain that. So we have off street parking our current pitch of our driveway. I think we mentioned this during the last meeting. The current pitching the driveway is quite steep and it makes it really difficult to drive into the driveway. And also we have had issues with storm water entering house because it slopes very steeply towards the house. And if the slab were forced to keep the slab height in the same position, it would be hard to fix this. And I should note in our current plan, we actually have made a solution, which we described last time, which actually creates almost no slope to our driveway, which would be a huge improvement. And, of course, using this existing foundation and the structural support we would need to put into it to maintain the. The house would be more expensive and it would maintain foundation that is outdated and in terms of the neighborhood and the community impact, if we were to keep the existing footprint of the house, it would maintain this very close north side setback, which we are trying to improve because if you remember from the map, we are the closest on that side to our neighbor at 57. And obviously, if we were forced to do this as well, but this would be even closer than what we're, we're asking to do now. And so we really feel like the variance. Well, I understand not always the easiest thing to get granted actually improves from where we currently are. And so, with that, I would just say, thank you for letting us share the rationale for this project and why we've come to you with variance on a personal note. Obviously. We're hoping to be able to to do this project. We've spent a lot of time and effort to design it. Saved money over every year that we've lived in this house. We have a young son. He just turned 5 yesterday. We'd like for him to go to kindergarten at Stratton this year. There are 3 other little boys who are also 5 on our dead end street who will also go to Stratton this year. And so we're just trying to do something that suits our families needs in the long term, but also. Does not negatively impact our neighbors and the neighborhood. So. Thank you. I'd be happy to take any questions.</blockquote>

We can have a, we can have a portion of the. Usable open space on on a slope lot, and that's what we have here. It's close. Now, in reality, this whole yard is used for open space and they do use it, but. By the definition of the law, we do meet it. A small percentage is part of a covered porch, which is allowed. I think 75% has to be open open to above. Sky to above and a small percentage of the open spaces on the slope, which is, which is allowed again. 75% has to be on there. I did the calculations and the math here. It checks out, so we're not before the board asking for any relief on the open. Usable space, and we will need to meet that, or we'll be back in front of you asking for relief on that. But just just to prove to you that we did look at it and everything that I see, meet, we meet the definition of it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, yeah, I just want to confirm because obviously this plan doesn't have the contour lines on it. So it's difficult to assess. And the prior plan has the has the contours, but doesn't have this area marked out. So I'm just trying to sort of get a sense because. As the homeowner said, this part of the parcel is sloped to such an extent that it creates a hardship. So I wanted to confirm that it wasn't so much. It wasn't so sloped that it was unable to be used as usable open space. Yeah, so by the definition of the regulations, it's over 8% that we calculated, but where we have enough of it on the flat area that it qualifies for it. Most of it's actually in a patio space that we're going to be. leveling off a little bit anyways. Okay. Hopefully that answers your question. It does. It does.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then a second question. So the, I'm assuming based on the discussion about the garage that the basement level is being raised. Is that correct? Yes. Raised and yeah, and it's actually slightly, this is where the hill actually does work in our favor because the garage is slightly moving down slope. The combination of raising the garage a little bit and moving it more down the slope allows us to have a much shallower pitch to the house. Which is easier to mitigate the drainage too. Okay. And then in terms of the level of the first floor relative to the average grade, do you have a dimension on that? I just want to confirm that we're not accidentally making that lowest level of story by raising it.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Bill Nolan - 138</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Great catch. Thank you. And we're not. Okay. I think, yeah. So the existing first floor, I'm sorry, the basement slab will be less than, less than four foot six of it will be exposed. Therefore it won't be classified as a story. And again, just to reiterate what Becca said during her presentation, that becomes significantly harder to do the further we move down the hill. Necessitating excessive fill and potentially retaining walls. The other thing I'd want to point out too is the way that the building department looks at land is it's not the land that touches the face of the wall. It's six feet out. So not only are you filling, you're filling six feet out in order to maintain the elevation that we need. So it is a significant amount of fill.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 440</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I'd like to congratulate Ms. Senter on her presentation and request that the applicants submit the PowerPoint presentation to us so that we can follow and ultimately when an opinion is written to take fully into consideration all the things she said. And I hope that would be okay. The question I have, we've sort of got a, you've got this house, there's a possibility that you'd have to make something completely meet the bylaw and the difficulties of doing that Ms. Senter described. And another possibility is just to stick to the same foundation and the disadvantages of that have been described. But this is a 4,500 square foot house, which is a pretty good size. And there's nothing in the zoning bylaw that says that you have to be able to achieve the full extent of what you'd like in order to avoid having a hardship. And I wonder whether, what would happen, how if you were going to renovate in the sense that you're building a new structure, you can't build 4,500 square feet in a sensible way because that has all the disadvantages that have been described. Where is it that you get to the point where you could build it, it obviously would be a hardship because it would be considerably less valuable than what you're proposing to do. But could you do 3,500 square feet, 3,000 square feet, essentially nothing more than you're currently doing? Where does it sort of switch where it's not, where suddenly it's practical, even if it's less than fully desirable to build something new? I get that this design wouldn't work in that way, but I just sort of like the record to sort of deal with that possibility that you just built a somewhat smaller house. It's a fair question. And I'll be honest and say that my husband and I spent more time than our design team would like thinking about the size of the house. For me, it really comes down to the footprint of where we've landed. I am not sure if we could get to a smaller square footage by decreasing the footprint of the house, because I think that the orientation of how we have designed at least the first floor in particular to have an open living space between the kitchen and the living room, such that they're positioned on the side of the property where the sunlight's best, I don't think there's a way for us to reduce the footprint of the house and achieve something that we would want to build, if that makes sense. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rebecca Senter and ? - 201</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I think the living space, I believe is closer to 3,400 square feet, was my understanding actually. Are you counting the basement with that? I'm just, I was just relying on the number in your application for gross square footage. Okay. Gross square footage takes into a little bit more into than complete living space. You have to include the basement spaces and I believe garage too. The only thing that you don't include is mechanical spaces, if I remember it correctly. I will say that that is one of the more complex formulas to generate space. So if I'm misstating it, I apologize. Living, finished living area though, we're about 3,500 square feet, which is, again, in keeping with the majority of the houses in that neighborhood. There's also a certain price point. I don't know if we need to get into or want to get into the economics of the property too, but Arlington is a, you know, it's a sought after place to live and these properties and houses sold a certain value. This, I believe, is in keeping with what is, you know, consistent in that neck of the woods, so to speak. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. I'm glad Mr. Hanlon raised that issue about house size because the hardship of cost of doing something different than this design is the hardship is created by the size of the, it's a self-created hardship because of the size of the proposed house. That the cost of doing it differently into the other lot that's part of this parcel as well is more expensive. I guess I have a question about the, and I don't know, I assume that the applicants can answer it. These were two parcels that have been combined by a single owner of two parcels. The tax bills that have been run on these houses all these years, or this house and the other lot all these years, I guess I would ask if the tax rate was the same on both parcels? If the applicant has, can address that question? I have no idea, sorry. Never quite paid attention to that. It's a fair question. I don't know the answer. Well, I imagine that it's not. I imagine that the one that the vast majority of the house is on right now. It's possible that the land value is similar between the two, but obviously the property value would be very different between the two. But I don't. Right, Mr. Chair, I asked about the tax rate as opposed to the tax bill. The tax rate on the land, I'm just wondering if the tax rate on the land was the same for both. And the reason being that many years of, let's say it was a lower tax rate on the undeveloped property, there's been a benefit retained by the owner all those years of a lower tax rate. Now, that's just an assumption. I don't know that the tax rate is lower. And that by not combining the properties, there was, if that is true, there was a lower rate on the undeveloped land that that was a benefit accrued to the owner for many, many, many, many years or various owners, including the current owners. And now the idea that the property is treated as a combined set of properties sort of solidifies now that makes that benefit permanent. I guess I'm not saying this very clearly. My big concern is that it looks from aerial views that there's some significant treaties on this undeveloped property that may be retained or may not. And so I would ask the question through you, Mr. Chair, what is the plan for the trees on what is now an undeveloped piece of property as well as the trees on the other one? I think this mirrors the issue I might've raised at the last meeting in the same sort of question. The two lots would have setbacks allied to both of them. The single lot would have setbacks allied to a combined that would be different perhaps for the retention of the trees. And I'm wondering what the plan generally is for the trees on the property, Mr. Chair.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Bill Nolan - 105</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don't believe that we documented the trees. If you don't mind, I can answer this back up. So if we're allowed to move forward with the proposal, we will speak with the tree warden and make sure that we work with the town with regards to this. There are some very mature trees that are very close to both houses. I think, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, Becca and Tim, I think both neighbors would like to see the large trees removed because they're somewhat dangerous and the intent would be to replace them with new trees that are healthier.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rebecca Senter - 209</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I can add those trees in question are, I think they were brought here from Canada by the people who originally bought the property 50 years ago, I think three years ago in a big Nor'easter. One of them was blown over and nearly took out our neighbor's house. So yeah, just to speak to the hazard of those, they're not native. Yeah, and so I recognize Mr. Moore's concern over trees. We also are avid nature and want to make sure that we maintain the trees on the property and as Tim mentioned, yeah, these trees are really tall and they scare the heck out of our neighbors as they're easily hundreds of feet tall. And as he mentioned, one fell one time, which was terrifying. So the plan has been to remove those very, very tall, dangerous trees that line the property line and replace them with something that is equally as beautiful but also safer. And that has actually been fully supported by every single one of our neighbors that we've talked to. No other trees though are planned to be removed or other than the tall ones and they will be replaced. And we will do this in accordance with the Arlington regs.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Steve Moore - 248</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr. Chair, I understand that tall trees can represent a danger. Usually that occurs because the trees haven't been maintained. Tall trees need to be maintained like any other plant and that means trimmed of their dangerous aspects as they grow. I will remind the applicant that the tall trees have a much larger impact on reducing global warming than small trees that replace them. It takes 35 years for a small tree to go grow enough to perform the valuable service that the current large tree is providing. With proper care, that large tree can be made safe. I don't, my whole diatribe about the two lots and tax rates and things like that was aimed towards the fact that setbacks of two lots are different than the setbacks of a combined lot. And I'm worried about the implications for these trees or the tree, the large tree in particular, and how removing it and replacing it, the smaller trees will not allow the community to have performed the same task that the current large tree performs. I understand that a lot of folks fear large trees because of the very thing that happened to one of them, which was it fell over and could easily have caused significant property damage. But I also, again, remind the applicant that proper maintenance of trees minimizes that risk and the community benefit, which may not accrue directly to the owner is lost if they are taken. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's the very same thing that the tree warden will relate to you when you speak with them and develop your tree plan. Again, I would encourage the applicant to retain the large tree, not take it down. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 834</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moore. Are there other members of the public who wish to address this hearing? I do not currently see any other names or any hands raised. Again, it's the reactions tab. There's a raise hand button if you wish to address this. I don't see anyone either waving their hands in a window. So I will assume that no one else wishes to address this hearing. So I will go ahead and close public comment for this hearing. So then that brings the question back to the board. So what is requested of the board is a variance on this property in regards to the front yard setback. I believe that is the only variance that is required for this property to move forward. Existing house is non-conforming on the lot in regards to both the front yard setback and in regards to the side yard setback. And as the applicant had noted, a project like this could have gone forward as a renovation, which would have imposed certain restrictions to reduce the size of the front yard. reuse of the existing house and how that might have impacted the project, but it would allow them to take advantage and maintain the existing nonconformities in regards to the side yard setback and the front yard setback. However, they are requesting of the board a variance to allow them essentially to reduce the existing setbacks that they have in regards to the front yard and the side yard in order to construct a house of the depth that they feel is appropriate to their needs. So with that, the board has before the question of a variance, we do have the standard for criteria that are required of a variance. And so I would just at the start turn to the board and see if there are any further questions they would want to ask of the applicant or the applicant's consultants in regards to the property or what is being proposed. Seeing none. So then the question before the board, the board would need under state law and under town law, the board needs to make a series of findings that in regards to a variance, those findings build upon each other so that if any of the particular findings cannot be made, then a variance cannot be granted under state law. So the first finding that the board would be required to make is that there is a circumstance relating to soil condition, shape or topography, especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located that would substantiate the granting of a variance. So essentially, is there something about the soil shape or topography of the site that specifically, that is particular to this site and not a general condition in the underlying district that would substantiate the need for a variance? And as the applicant has stated, and I would ask her correctly if I have this thing correctly, essentially the lot that they have is a long, it's sort of a long narrow lot, but it is oriented parallel to the street rather than perpendicular to the street, which creates certain conditions for them so that the largest setbacks that are required under our bylaws are actually working against the short dimension as opposed to working against the long dimension of their property. And they are looking to comply with the rear yard setback, which necessitates the front yard setback is not as it would be required for the district. And they have also noted that the setback that they are proposing in the front is more in keeping with what is common for the district. And I would note that we had at the prior hearing, we did have a substantial amount of conversation about the town does have in its bylaws section 5310, which allows for setting the setback of a property relative to basically the average of the other properties that are developed on that block. And this is kind of a quirky situation because there are only two houses on the block. And so if you remove the one house, the house that remains is no longer more than 50% of the block. And so that is not something that's available to them, but it does indicate a willingness in the town bylaws that maintaining a level street front is something that the town has contemplated and has felt as something that might be appropriate. But the question is really is whether the shape of the lot and the topography of the lot would justify the granting of a variance. Because I think we have the conversation with the soils expert that they had done test pits and it is basically loose gravel. So there is nothing particular about the soil conditions that would make it difficult to comply with the bylaws. So it really comes down to shape and the topography of the site.</blockquote>

Yeah, sorry, I just wanted to add one thing is the perpendicular or the parallel with the street is also the hill. So, and I think that's the critical part here is that by being parallel with the street, we're also parallel with the hill.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 328</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, thank you. Mr. Hanlon. So Mr. Chairman, under the way the state law has written the requirement for soil slope or topography is that the hardship has to arise from that. It's not as if we evaluate separately slope and shape in order to decide whether or not a variance is required. We just have to make sure that the hardship that's being claimed is coming from a relatively unusual situation that relates to the shape and topography. And if you look at what the hardship is that the applicant are claiming, we may or may not agree that that is a sufficient hardship to warrant a variance, but it is flowing from the shape and topography. This is clearly a very shallow lot. Dealing with that in some way is clearly something that the topography makes more difficult. So that then will bring us to the question of whether there is, and I guess the other core thing is that it's not as if every lot on this street has this problem. Generally, they don't have this problem. It's probably not true that throughout Arlington, there must be other places that have shallow lots and there certainly are places that are on Steve Hill. It's the combination and taking a certain degree of local view of what the comparison is, at least in this particular area, this is an unusual situation that prevents the applicant from doing some things that are being done by the other properties in the area. And later we would presumably get to the question about the impact on the neighborhood and whether something is consistent with the bylaw and we can hold that analysis. But it does seem to me that if this is an absolutely unique, it's not the Mona Lisa, it may not even be an Andy Warhol, which is hardly unique at all, but it seems to me to be enough to get us to criteria number two.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Other comments from the board? Seeing none, unless there's any objections from the board, we'll move on to criteria two. So criteria two is that the literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning bylaw, specifically relating to the circumstances affecting the land or structure noted above would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise to the petitioner or appellant. So literal enforcement would mean that they do have to maintain that 25 foot setback where they're now proposing, I believe it's 16.6 feet. And as the appellant had said earlier, that would limit their house to 26 feet in depth, which is unusually shallow for a house. Granted the length of the lot is perpendicular to, it could be very long, but it does sort of create an odd situation where it's effectively, you would have that side of the house facing the street rather than the front. And so, so I guess the question of the literal enforcement, would it create a substantial hardship to the appellant? So the question that the board needs to address.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 599</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I sort of began that. So I thought in my view, the answer is yes. And let's take it in three different ways. One is let's suppose that the applicant were to say, okay, we're going to enforce the zoning bylaw or to say, okay, we'll observe it. I think that the house that would emerge is a significantly less desirable house. Just objectively, it's a less desirable house. The long, narrow thing makes it even, even if it's feasible to do that, that that would be a significant harm. But of course, it's true that the zoning bylaw doesn't guarantee you everything you want. So it's important to look at the alternatives to see what, to see just to what degree this is a matter of sort of unreasonable ambitions rather than a matter of real hardship. I think that trying to do it over on the, on the existing foundation would be a substantial hardship and would be extremely negative for the community as well. Preserving the existing foundation would be a real problem. It's environmentally quite unsound to do that. And it would ultimately produce, if it's feasible at all, it would produce a house that's very, very different from what the applicant is looking to do. So then there's the intermediate. So it just in general, I'm persuaded by what Ms. Senter said about that. I don't want to go into it in great detail, but I thought her presentation was persuasive. So the middle thing is let's suppose you have a somewhat smaller house. At what point can you have something that's reasonably satisfactory, but that doesn't involve the kinds of problems that we've been talking? And it's a little vague on this. And I think that people can come to different views on it, but I do think that trying to sort of just make, take the half a loaf approach rather than being like Goldilocks, it might be a little bit like splitting the baby. It's not really going to address the kind of hardship that is involved here. Obviously there is a house that's small enough that you can fit it on here, but you have to sort of have a general sense of what's reasonable. Certainly making this the Taj Mahal is not reasonable, but this is an area that has a certain character to it. And actually the thing that the proposal that the applicant has that is most consistent with what is existing in the area is the proposal that they're making to us for which they need a variant. So I think that the half a loaf is really not better at this point. And that the difficulty is I feel for their predicament and believe that the house, the alternatives that we've discussed are not really sufficient to make this simply something you have to get along with as opposed to something that is the kind of harm that the zoning bylaw deals with. I will say that in other cases, we've found that it's just a hard hardship not to be able to build a driveway on your property. It's not as if the kind of hardship that is involved here that is involved in a variance has to be, to some extent, it involves a significant interference with your ability to do what you otherwise have a right to do. Under the law, it's very unclear, but I think that I don't really think this is that close to the edge. I think that there is a hardship here.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Other comment from the board in regards to the second criteria? Seeing none, unless there's an objection, I'll move on to the third criteria, which is the desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. I think that the construction of the house as it is being proposed where, although it is not as far from the street as would be required for a new permit, where it is deeper than it currently is, and it appears to be more in keeping with the adjacent house to it, and in keeping with the, in more generally the pattern of the street, that this is not any form of detriment to the public good, should the relief be granted. Any other comments in regards to criteria three?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. LeBlanc. Mr. LeBlanc. I guess on this point, just also wanted to add that with this current design and going with a new construction house here, that it actually does benefit not only the neighborhood, but the town itself as it'll be much more energy efficient and built in a much more sustainable way than the current building that is there, the current house that is there. So it'll be improving the neighborhood and through that as well, not just it being in the structure, but it being an energy efficient one that'll help improve that as well. Thank you, Mr. LeBlanc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I both agree with what Mr. LeBlanc said, and I would like to address what Mr. Moore has been talking about. The question of the, there will be required a tree plant anyway, as Mr. Nolan pointed out, and there'll be a discussion that will parallel the kind of discussion we had here today. And it seems to me that probably the tree warden can deal with that in an effective way if the applicant is being cooperative about doing that, but I would, I'd encourage the applicant to take very seriously what Mr. Moore said and what the tree warden says in designing a tree preservation plan on this site. It's, that is certainly a part of the impact that this has on the public, and it's not necessarily a simple issue, but it's something that needs to be done with the town's expert, and that will be done in ordinary course.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Unless there's any objection from the board, I'll move on to criteria four. So criteria four is that desirable relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the zoning bylaw. So should the board grant relief, we will be exchanging a one-family house for a new, larger, more energy-efficient one-family house. It will be sitting in approximately the same location. It will be, it will extend slightly deeper into the site, but not past any setbacks, and it will leave a substantial portion of the yard open for the enjoyment of the owners, but also providing open space and open air for the properties that do abut that portion of the property. And certainly the construction along those lines would not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the zoning bylaw, which is the careful development of land, the improvement in quality of the land, improvement of the value of the town, while maintaining some of the natural aspects, access to air, access to light, and sort of preservation of the character of the town. And I think that should the board grant this variance application, it would not derogate from any of those intents. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I agree with that. I just add one thing in that this is a situation where if we'd step back from the language of section 5.3.10, and we look to sort of at what the urban planning aspect of all of this is, this is a neighborhood where actually keeping and observing the 25 feet is likely to be somewhat out of, certainly if you look across the street, it would be somewhat out of character with what is the established pattern there. And if the purpose of the bylaw is to figure, is to provide for harmony in the way the streets are laid out, and we're free to look at both sides of the street instead of what we have to do for just the literal application of the bylaw, it seems to me that the underlying policy of land use here is well-situated by something that provides for more setback than there is today, but not as much as the full setback that would be required by the bylaw. So, in some ways, as is true of much of this case, in some ways, granting the variance is more in the public interest and more consistent with the purpose of the bylaw than denying it would be.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Other comments from the board? Seeing none. So the board has a couple of tasks in front of it at this point. One is to codify a vote on the findings to confirm the vote on the four findings. Should the board vote positively on all four findings, then we will move on to conditions and whether there are conditions that the board would need to impose in order to ensure that what the board is looking for in regards to the granting of this application would be carried forward. And then the board would take one final vote on the variance application, including the conditions. So unless there's anything that needs to occur before that, I was gonna go ahead and move to the vote on the findings. So it's been the board's practice because of variances, sort of a different sort of animal than our typical, excuse me, special permits that we do vote on the four findings because we do need a positive vote on all four findings. It cannot just be on the majority of the findings. So with that, in regards to the first finding that circumstances relating to soil condition shape topography, especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally the zoning district in which it is located, that would substantiate the granting of a variance. So members of the board voting to affirm that finding. There goes that, where's my other sheet? So I would ask for the vote. Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Mr. Holly? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. The chair votes aye. That is the finding is affirmed. The second finding, literal enforcement of the provisions of the zoning bylaws, specifically relating to the circumstances affecting the land or structures noted above would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise to the petitioner or abelant. So this again requires an affirmative vote of the board. So with that, Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Mr. Holly? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. And the chair votes aye. That finding is affirmed. That brings to the third, that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good. Again, an affirmative vote required of the board. Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Mr. Holly? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. That is affirmed. That brings us to the fourth and final finding that desirable relief may be granted without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the zoning bylaws. Again, affirmative vote is required. Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Mr. Holly? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. And Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. That is affirmed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so the board has found that it can grant a variance in this case. And as I said, that brings us up to conditions. So there are three standard conditions that the board applies to all applications before it. The first is that the plans and specifications approved by the board for this variance shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington in connection with this application for zoning relief. There shall be no derivation, excuse me, there shall be no deviation during construction from the approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. Number two is the building inspector is hereby notified that they are to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time they determine that violations are present. The building inspector shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw and under the provisions of chapter 40, section 21D of the Massachusetts general laws and institute non-criminal complaints. If necessary, the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action also in accordance with section 3.1. And standard condition number three is the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to this variance grant. Are there other conditions that members of the board feel would be appropriate for this application?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any other conditions that members of the board feel would be appropriate? Hearing none. And what the board has finally in front of it is a request for a variance. The board has found that the applicant has met the requirements for a variance and the board has put forward four conditions, the three standard plus an additional regarding compliance with the tree protection and preservation bylaw. So with that, unless there are any other questions from the board, the chair would entertain a motion. Mr. Hanlon, I'm not hearing you. For some reason, it's coming across very quietly. That's just because it's me. There we go. All right, Mr. Chairman, I move that the board approve the variance in this application subject to the three standard conditions and the fourth condition regarding trees that the chair just read into the record. Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. May I have a second? Second. Thank you, Mr. Holy. So what the board has before it, this is a vote to approve a variance for 53 Lansdowne Road with four conditions, the three standard plus the one in regards to tree protection. So a roll call vote of the board is required. Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Mr. Holy? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. And the chair votes aye.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, thank you. So before you are images of the existing house at 165 Franklin, firstly, good evening and thank you for this time. We are seeking a special permit to construct or maybe reconstruct the second dwelling unit at 165 Franklin Street as an attached house behind the existing house. As Kristen indicated, it's 11,000 square foot lot and we are seeking a special permit for the large addition pursuant to section 5.4.2B, number six. The addition, are you still seeing my screen now? Thank you. Yes, we are. Okay, so this is the existing footprint at 165 Franklin. Last seen the images. I'm sorry, I still haven't seen the images, yeah. Okay. I think I'd be used to this by now. How many years into this? There we go. So this is the footprint of the existing house. It also includes a large addition on the side that we are being allowed to remove by historic and then an addition to the rear. So we're sort of stripping it down to its 1850s form and restoring that in its appearance with a more contemporary interior layout. And then it would be attached to two separate garages and then behind that would be another dwelling unit sort of replacing the up-down arrangement of the two family to a front and back townhouse arrangement. The house is set back quite a ways. I believe it's 37 feet from the front property line. So we have a very nice yard for the front unit and then we're 32 feet off the rear property line. So another nice yard for the back unit. And then we conform to all the side setbacks for the new construction. The existing house does sit in the left hand setback but we're not increasing that in any way. And so we're conforming to all the zoning standards. The only thing that we need is to be able to add the amount of addition that would make another nice house on the lot. So this is again, the layout of the front house, the attached garage, which is a one story connector and then another two and a half story addition to the rear. And then I do have a larger elevation. So the front elevation, this is the restored facade, scaling it back or taking it back to its 1850s sort of a simple form Greek revival. And then the back house, which is further back than this flat drawing shows would mimic that in its details and execution. And then this is the side elevation, the right hand side elevation. And then, so we were in the midst of maybe three or four historic hearings and we had to quickly pivot and retain the rear addition of the house. So this is the elevation that we are now seeking and it should be in the, it was uploaded to the portal and it's included in everyone's packet, but it's slightly different from the original submission that was done in December. It's maybe turned out to be a slightly better project for that. And then this is the rear inside elevations. I do have I did pull up a PDF of the GIS map to give a sense of the area that this addition will sit in. So we are back here and again, we are 32 feet off the rear property conforming to the 10 foot setbacks. And we feel that in terms of like a figure ground study, this is, it's compatible with the neighborhood. And I think, yeah, I don't know, maybe there's some other questions. I'm sort of running out of my own things to present.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Gregory Salamazkas - 179</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes. As I started with, this is what we're starting with. As you see the house here in white vinyl, much smaller windows, nothing very, not very much evidence other than the massing of the house that it's an 1850s Greek Revival house. It was, this is a photo of it in 1980 when it was actually put into the, when it was into the, not registry, but into the, I'm losing my word, but the reason it was identified is it's because of its form. And at the time that it was identified as a historic property of interest, it was in good shape. A lot has happened to it since. And so that would be our goal is to restore some of this quality. So in our back and forth, we had initially sought to remove all the additions except for the main mass of the house. And then later on, it was determined that the main rear L of the house was original to it so that we had to work with that as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could go back to the site plan. Sure. Site plan, go. Actually, if you go back to the existing site plan, sorry. Sure, yep. So looking at the existing site plan, so there is an existing driveway that comes down the side of the house and sort of widens as it goes down. So you are removing a lot of the existing driveway and then you're going to have to move it to the existing site plan. So you're removing a lot of the existing driveway and then you're going to have to move it to the new site plan. Are we moving and replacing that? Is that correct?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Gregory Salamazkas - 55</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, yes. We would be maintaining the driveway pretty much in the same location. There's a portion of this that gets removed. The main mass was sort of bumped out another room size and then we would have a surface parking spot here, aprons into the garage, one spot here and then the new house.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 130</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one question that I had had when I was going through is that the town requires that driveways be no wider than 20 feet. And the proposed drawing doesn't have any dimensions in regards to the width of the drive itself, but would just want to confirm that the driveway at its widest, which would be where it is extending to the garage, that that would not exceed 20 feet. And does that apply to cars making a sweep into a garage? It does. That's my understanding from my conversation with the building inspector. Okay, okay. Well, we can verify that. Okay. If it exceeds 20 feet, it was merely because it was a matter of getting the car into the garage and being able to maneuver the vehicle.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein and Gregory Salamazkas - 166</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then also in the parking bylaw, there's required to be a vegetated buffer between the driveway and the property line. And just because you are extending the drive farther to the back, would want to make sure that some care is taken as to the nature and dimensions of that buffer, so that that is not, wouldn't be considered an afterthought. Yeah, I believe we have room to enhance the existing, definitely enhance the existing buffer that's there and add more to it. And then it does appear here that there's a sort of an oval shaped feature labeled patio and to the left of it, is that a tree that's to the left of it there? That I believe was a tree that has been removed. Was that removed recently, or was that removed some time ago? I don't know if we've removed that. We've removed that. Probably from the past. I don't Kristen and Greg, can you. Fill us in on that.</blockquote>

Characterized as a two family or that there, it was not in the records as a two family. Is that correct? Yes. Let me go ahead and. Okay. Issued by the, the building inspector. Let me see if I can make this a little bit bigger here. So I had asked the building inspector for just a clarification of exactly what the board was. Required to find. They responded that the property is a single family dwelling in an art two districts. And that there is no record of a second unit being constructed. The applicant seeking permission to build an addition that exceeds 750 square feet. And it's seeking a special parameter five, four, two B. Five, four, two B six. For large additions. So my question, Mr. Chairman is just, is it currently. Two units that are being inhabited by two different. Individuals or families. Okay. I would turn to Mr.</blockquote>

It appears that had been for a long time. But again, a two, two family is a. Allowed use. Right. So is that in question? No, I think it's just, just confirming for the record as to what the, what the nature of the occupancy has been. Okay. I think I'm just struggling with the question a bit because I was taken by surprise because this came into us a little late. And so, and I'm sorry, I don't have my microphone close. So it came in a little bit late. And I've just been sort of wondering to myself, you know, what, if any ramification is there. If in fact, it's only classified as a single family. Under the, you know, under the town's records. I don't know if there's anything that would come of that, but it's something that I. I would like to be able to consider in case there is something more to it. So that's. Yeah, maybe something for Mr. Cunningham to comment on. Although I'm sure. He would also only be getting this. You know, the 11th hour. But that was my concern, Mr. Chairman. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mr. Cunningham.</blockquote>

I live at 37 Hamlet street. So my I'm one of the butters. To the property at one 65 Franklin. And I purchased my home. A year and a half ago, And I moved to Arlington a year and a half ago. And I moved to Arlington. So soon after moving to Arlington. So I have in front of me. A brief. A set of comments that I want to read. I'm I I'm reading the comments as opposed to just speaking So the first is. So I'm going to read the comments to the town, to the zoning board. Outlining 11 points in opposition to the special permits. I won't read all 11 for you this evening. But I just want to highlight three. So my first is simply based on the zoning bylaws. So the proposed addition. Is not harmonious with my property or my neighbor's homes. There's no home in the vicinity that resembles the proposed addition. So I don't see any. I don't see any harm in a developer from damaging neighborhoods in this way. So the, the architect suggested that their property is harmonious and I would just ask to show us which, which property is like this in the neighborhood. I don't see any. So the, the second. Is that the developer's profit is not an allowable exception in the bylaws. As the member members of the zoning board previously noted, because there's space is also not an allowable exception in the bylaws. And the third and final point is just a personal plea to the zoning board. So please deny the special permit because the changes would negatively affect my family's experience of our new home. And our new neighborhood. As I've said, we moved to this area from out of state only a year and a half ago. If the proposed addition were built, I would look out our windows or my kids would be playing in our backyard. And we would see this large second home, a two and a half story home structure in our backyard. And I would ask you to imagine what it would feel like to lose such an open view of the sky and of the trees. Instead of the skies and trees we see right now. So I attached pictures of my current view to the letter I submitted to the zoning board so that you can see my current backyard. And see how imagine how it would negatively affect our experience of our home. So again, to the members of the zoning board, I asked you to imagine what it would feel like to lose such an open view of the sky and of the trees. And that you can see my current backyard. And yet another instance of how it's not harmonious with. The properties surrounding. So for these and other reasons outlined in my longer letter, I urge the zoning board of appeals to deny the special permit request. And protect the character of my neighborhood. Thank you.</blockquote>

The proposed addition would run beyond the tree that you see on the proposed addition. And that would be. That would be a two and a half story. Not the garage that's. Yeah. Yeah. And then just a view slightly to the right. Of that as well. So that the tree at the back of the property. So here's this I'm assuming that this tree. That's in the center of the image and the.

So if there were discussions with the tree warden about the tree that was taken, I'm very, very pleased that you approached the tree warden on, on that activity. Did he tell you was a, not a protected tree? Is that why it was okay to take, or what was, what was the purpose of taking down a tree?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would never take down a tree. I would never take down a tree just to take down a tree. It was smack in the middle of the location where we would be building. Unfortunately, I hate to take down any tree. But in this case. It was necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Mr. Chair, that that's understandable. I'm just curious. I mean, I know that the trees are on the periphery of the property. And again, it's a little hard to tell from the satellite pictures. What's where. I don't, what are the plans relative to the trees on the surrounding edges of the property, which would be protected trees. That I'll have to go over with the tree warden.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, Mr. Chair. Thank you.

The assertion that they're not going to be taken. And there's a lot of other reasons for that. And I think. It's important to say that there are some trees that, as I, I mentioned on the previous case. Has a large impact on global warming as opposed to small trees, which get replaced. So thank you, Mr. That's that's it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah. Thanks a lot. And thanks for giving me the opportunity to speak. Michael side. I'm the homeowner of one 36 Webster street. Which basically we are as the house at the, the chairs, the back fence. And in the diagram that was shared. So. The new construction, when it is built, it will basically. Take all this back fence or the most of it. To the front of the house. And while my garage kind of hides some of the view of one 65 Franklin. From my backyard. This is completely a clear view. Clearly Ben has done his homework and I echo everything that Ben have said. And I agree with that. In addition, I would say. The, the, the house that the prior tenant has used for storage was short. And small as you would expect from green houses. So the view similar to Ben's picture. Is open and wide. And we can clearly see the sky and the. The two family houses. House was like far from us. Which will create a privacy for both sides. Now was this proposed? It's kind of like adding another house. Whereas you were one. Definitely would make it crowded. We'll change the scenery. We'll block the air and the sun. It also. And I would like you to consider that if you approve this. You'll be creating a situation where over time. The rest of the lots that are next to these houses will end up doing the same. So I would like you to consider that. And I would also like you to consider that. When these homeowners move. Developers will then know I can switch a one family home or like whatever one house structure for two families or whatever and build in the back. If you have seen from the picture. The house over has just a garage. Whereas the new plans are proposing to build a garage and another house. And that will definitely alter the view and the structure. I have owned this house for eight years. I have known the prior tenant. And definitely this will change the circumstances. Around my house. Thanks a lot.</blockquote>

I'd like to talk a little bit about what apologies I need. I do need to ask your address for the record. Sorry. 41 Hamlet street. Sorry. Thank you so much. I'd like to talk and I am in a butter. And I echo what Michael and Ben have said already. Wholeheartedly. I'd like to talk a little bit about the house that I've lived here quite a while. And I've never known two families to live in that house. It's always been one family as far as I've known. And prior to the person that just sold it. It was another family. And. I've never known two people, two families to live in that house. But, you know, That's that's why what the, the, the letter that the town said, interest me. As far as that goes. I'm I'm very concerned about. I'm looking at the, the bylaw. For a two family district R2. I'm very concerned that this house does not fit into the neighborhood. And the least bit. I'd welcome the board. To walk up Franklin either way. Towards the center off of Hamlet. Towards parallel street that way. And I do agree with Michael that this lot is similar to this. What this proposal. And I agree with Michael that if you open the door on this one. You can, you can bet. You're going to open the door on a lot coming forward. And I don't think it's correct. I don't think it's correct to build a new house. In the back of this lot. I think the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the. The property values. For those of us who've been in the neighborhood for a long time. And it really doesn't meet the residential character. Of the neighborhood. You know, the town also states they don't want. Properties to consume large amounts of land. And certainly in this instance, This thing takes up almost the whole lot. So. With all due respect and with all due respect and with all due deterrence, I asked that you deny the special permit. It would, it would drastically affect our neighborhood. And it's been a great neighborhood. People have lived here. Very consistently for a very long time. And this, this project. It's going to drastically alter things. Both up and down Franklin street. So thank you for your time. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next time I see is Dan ledger. Hey there. directly to the left of this property. I think I agree with a lot of the points that have been made here. I think one other point I'd like to pick up that Michael made is that, there's a wonderful corridor, these long lots create a lot of open space behind these houses, and there's a lot of trees, it provides nice views. I think this, again, I agree, this creates a dangerous precedent and would be very disruptive to this. I think of the views that a lot of people enjoy, a lot of people purchase their houses for because this is an area of Arlington where people have these nice open wide backyards and it does create. You look at your windows, you see a lot of green trees. I used to look at a beautiful weeping willow tree that just got cut down a couple of months ago. I think we're just saddened by this idea that there's going to be this giant new house that pushes into the space. I also agree that this sets a dangerous precedent for this area on Franklin Street, where people have a little bit extra green space in the back, and it affords a lot of folks around us just a nicer view over the fence, and a little bit more view of your neighbors, and a little bit more connection, and things like that. I'm in alignment with what the other folks have spoken up on this. Great. Thank you so much.</blockquote>

And I actually agree with John that it used to be always a one-family property. There was always one family who lived there for two decades. So I think that's one point which really needs clarification. And I really do echo everyone else's concerns about the second large building. I think there is a picture of two garage spots plus another car in the driveway. You know, one tree was already cut down. I think there are multiple other trees which are around. So I think we worry not only just about the big building, which really does not fit in the neighborhood, but also the environmental aspect.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello. Actually, this is Ashley Mangrum. I live at the property at 37 Hamlin Street as well. And yes, I am Ben's partner. And I just would want the community to hear that there are a number of children, elementary-age children. Our youngest child is three years old, and there are toddlers. There's an infant in the family that's already spoken. And while that might not sound like much to you, surrounding this property is more than a handful of children, ages a couple of months up to teenage years. So actually, off the top of my head, I can think of eight children. And so eight children who play in this neighborhood, in these backyards, in this community, now will be seen by the family that lives in the two-and-a-half structure, two-and-a-half structure, yeah. And so I just, I don't feel comfortable with a structure in my backyard where people can look over and see all of these neighboring backyard children playing. And when our children look up to play and have a good time, all of us, what they see is a massive structure, literally feet from our fence line. And so I would urge you to consider the experience of the children in our neighborhood, in addition to the property value and property owners, and thinking about what kind of space are we creating and protecting for them in our neighborhood. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. So with that, seeing no other hands raised, I'll go ahead and close the public comment period for this hearing. So this returns us back to the board. So the request that is before the board, it's a special permit request for a large addition. And under our bylaws, it is a special permit. And so it needs to meet the special permit criteria, but it also needs to make, we need to make three additional findings, which are not typical for a special permit. One is that the alteration or addition is in harmony with other structures and uses in the vicinity. The second is that considering we need to consider the dimensions and the setback in relation to a budding structures and uses. And the third is that we need to consider conformity with the purposes of the bylaw. And that is the only request for, that is being made for the special permit. As I had mentioned to the applicant earlier, there's a concern about the driveway width that under 6.1.10a, a driveway can only be 20 feet wide maximum. And then under that also under that same section that a vegetated buffer is required between the drive, if our driveway in the side, on the side yard setback. So those are things that the board would be looking to, to make sure are addressed. So the board has received both from the applicant, the description of the proposed addition. And we have in the record, there's the letter from the historic commission that this project has been reviewed and approved by the historic commission, which has now brought it to us. And as I say, the board needs to make a determination in regards to a special permit for large addition. So, and at this hearing tonight, the board has heard from a number of, of residents who are butters to this property with their concerns about the project. So I would open up to the board for their. Questions and concerns or comments in regards to the requested application.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Adam LeBlanc - 223</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mr. LeBlanc. I guess I would just start by arguing that I don't think the proposed addition is very harmonious with the rest of the neighborhood. You know, this is, I think a pretty unique lot in the area. I mean, it doesn't feel like it's being this deep looking at the other lots. It's you know, they're not that deep, but. The way that this is being proposed. It sort of feels like it's two structures. Being put on one lot. Yes, they're connected, but. Barely by a little garage. And the existing structure that is there doesn't seem to. You know, feel like there's a need for a duplex type or. Potentially even a townhouse. Style. Renovation at that place. So I just don't see the need for such a large addition. And also generally when we see large additions come before us, at least in my experience so far. I don't see the need for such a large addition. You know, they're a family adding on to their existing house to create some more space for their growing family. And not necessarily such a large addition. This is. I think really, really large. So, yeah, I would say that I don't think it meets, you know, some of the criteria for being harmonious with the rest of the neighborhood.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 657</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hamlin. I think I'm inclined to agree that there's a problem with meeting this special. Revision here for. Harmoniousness with the neighborhood. I think it's important that all of the butters agree with one another that. It is hard. Disharmonious with them. Without at least being moved somewhat in that direction. I would disagree a little bit with what Mr. LeBlanc said about building another house before the actually, you know, building a new house. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. It's not just in East Arlington. I can remember a case that where we had a similar case on Mount Vernon street, a couple of years ago. So it's not that there's anything particularly wrong with the structure where you sort of, instead of having. Duplexes side by side, you have a front front to back that happens. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. I think that's a good point. Problems is not what usually happens, but what might be true in any individual case. This is not as strong a case. In some ways as others. I think in some ways that. Usually what you're dealing with is people building a house that involves a large mass. And. And. A large amount of property. And that's what that sort of was what. The bylaw was intended to. To deal with where something. Is consistent with the setback requirements, but it is built in an already built out area in a way. In which it interferes with people's use of their, of their own property by sort of encroaching with too much mass or too much property. And so. I don't think that that's true, but to a considerable extent, the testimony. Is that this is, this is adversely affecting people's use of their own property because they can't look into the neighbor's property. Which is at least a more fraught case than, than the one that is typical. Still doing this is essentially moving out. Is it, it is affecting an. A number of other. Neighborhoods. Where the, because of the long backyard. The, the impact. It is quite is sort of crowding. And sort of, if you step back and think about it more broadly in terms of the pattern of development in the neighborhood. Often it's a good thing. To put this in back. And then to leave the front of the house. And, and, and, and, and the, and the front of the house is going to look better than it does now. And is deliberately being restored to something that looks more like the 1850s house. That has made it has made it valuable. The difficulty here is not so much from the street. Is that all the others who are sitting who are all around it. It's the fact that there's so much. There's so much. There's so much. Matt in mass and lap lot coverage. That is affecting the way they use the back of their houses. And I think that the sheer unanimity of, of the neighbors and the sense that this is a pretty large structure in the back. These units are not. And I don't think that this is the right street for it. Hamlin has, excuse me, Franklin does have. I must be getting used to. To the theater. Franklin. Does have a sort of a character of its own. And. I think marginally, this is, this is a difficult thing. It's particularly because of the special. The special rule that we apply to large additions. If this was a straightforward special permit. And didn't have the special. Relations. The analysis might be different. But here. My law deliberately puts a stump on the scale somewhat. In favor of, of the abutters. And here, I think they've made enough of the case.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Roger Dupont - 534</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Mr. DuPont. So I was actually going to try to quote Mr. Hamlin from the pleasant street case where he essentially said the same thing. About the large addition section of the bylaw. And even though I think people on the board members of the board could come to a different result using the analysis. I just wanted to make sure that, that, that. You know, that's thumb on the scale in favor of the neighbors. Cause while there's no. There's no strictly speaking right to a view or right to light. to take into account the effect that it has, the relation to abutting structures and uses, which to me means to the neighbors. And so I believe that that is where you do have that added dimension when you're looking at this as opposed to different special permit sections that we do other things under. So maybe not a very articulate rendition of what Mr. Hanlon said, but I echo his findings. And I think when you look at that section two, where it says in conformity to the purposes of the bylaw, I go back to the section that Mr. Donnelly, one of the neighbors quoted, which was just reciting the language of 5.4.1 residential districts, sub three, which is two family districts. And I saw what he saw, which is the town discharges uses that consume large amounts of land. And I think if you look at it and if you were to go, Mr. Chairman, I don't know if you can get this up easily, but in the Arlington inventory, one of the attachments that was in the record, it's where you have the Massachusetts cultural resource information system, where it has a picture of the house from, I believe, 1980. But then if you go down farther, it has the assessor's map. I think that's what this is. And it circles the structure. And you can see that this lot, as well as two, which I believe are going to the north, are very sizable in the 11,000 square foot range. And so first of all, those lots are, they're not typical of the neighborhood. And so that I think that you have to be careful in using them and building on them, because you have to take into account the character of the neighborhood and everything else around it is fairly small lots with space that's limited and covered in large part by the houses. And I think that even though it's a large lot, the idea that you would put a second residence behind it is really too much massing. I mean, you're approaching 8,000 square feet based upon the numbers that were provided in the application. And I just don't think that that's harmonious with the neighborhood. I don't think it's really in conformity with the bylaw in the definition of the two-family district. And as Mr. Hanlon has said, you have to take into account what the neighbors, the abutters have to say. And I think they've been pretty uniform in their view. So I'm disinclined to believe that something that large is a good idea for this particular location. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dan Ricardelli - 188</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chair. Yes, Mr. Ricconelli. If I could just maybe echo a little bit of what Mr. DuPont said, I think that the biggest challenge for me with this proposal is just the size of the project. I mean, several of the members of the board live in East Arlington. It's not very common to have a nearly 8,000 square foot house in this neighborhood. And I'm sympathetic to the neighbors because space is at a premium here and access to light and views and use of somewhat small backyards like many of us have in this neighborhood is sort of like a sacred. So I am sympathetic to that. So I think really the size, but also the height of that addition, if we were looking at a one story addition that went as far back in the slot as is proposed, I think we would be having a different conversation, but because it is a two and a half story, 32 foot tall structure, I think that that sort of changes the calculation in terms of that large addition section of our zoning bylaws. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 1037</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Are there other questions or comments from the board? So seeing none. So what is now before the board is we sort of would need to make a decision in regards to how we want to proceed. So I think we should review the findings that would be required. And then at the end, the board can decide whether or not it feels the findings have been made as a whole. So the required findings for a special permit as under section 333, that the requested use is allowed or allowed by a special permit in the district. So two family is allowed, the duplex is allowed because it is a two family district and it does not require any additional approval for the use. The requested use is essential or desirable to public convenience and welfare. So two family residential use is desirable in the town of Arlington because it does allow for the increasing the number of people who are able to take advantage of the town and to be residents of the town. It also improves the tax base for the town. Requested use will not create undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety. So it is a duplex in a two family district, which would not create any undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety. I would note that this block, I actually didn't go to the end of the street. I had to look down the street and thought it might be blocked off at the end, but maybe it does loop around. We'll ignore that. But it is, you are able to walk down the street and cut over towards the Minister River. So there is some pedestrian traffic, but it's not different than any other two family district. That the use would not overload any public systems. So the use as a two family would not overload any town or utilities that would serve the property. Special regulations for the requested use are fulfilled. So the special regulations, that's the 542B6 large additions, which would allow the creation of a large addition. So we'll go and review that in a minute, but I'll finish up with section 333 first. So the next is the requested use will not impair the character or integrity of the neighborhood. So a two family use would not impair the character integrity of the neighborhood, but there has been a lot of discussion from abutting neighbors that the proposed structure would impair the character and integrity of the neighborhood. The requested use will not be detrimental to public health or welfare. Similarly, the use as a duplex would not be detrimental to public health or welfare, but abutters have indicated that they feel that the structure itself would be detrimental in terms of a lack of privacy and impacts on light and air that are available towards the rear of their properties. And then the requested use will not cause an excess of use detrimental to the neighborhood. Again, the duplexes aren't allowed use. This would not create an excess of duplexes, but in regards to the size of the proposed structure here, it might, as stated by the abutters, it could be considered an excess of structure in this area of the lot of the site. So those are the conditions for special permit that's specific to the large additions. We said before the alteration or addition isn't, we have to find that the alteration or addition is in harmony with other structures and uses in the vicinity. And whereas the use is certainly in harmony with other uses in the vicinity, there has been a lot of discussion that the addition itself is not in harmony with the other structures in the vicinity. That the location upon the lot, the depth that the structure extends into the lot, the size of the structure and the height of the structure are not harmonious with the current use pattern in the neighborhood, and it's not harmonious with the enjoyment of the, the abutters having enjoyment of their own property, abutting this property. The board needs to consider dimensions and setbacks in relation to abutting structures and uses. As the applicant said, they do meet the setback requirements under the bylaw with the exception of the existing structure that has a slight nonconformity on the north side of the house. But because it's going so deep into the property, it's coming close to a lot of other structures that it would not necessarily come close to, which is a little bit of an unusual circumstance in this case. And the board needs to consider conformity with the purposes of the bylaw, to the purposes we don't often discuss during the meeting, but it might be helpful in the circumstance. So the purpose of the bylaw is to promote the health, safety, convenience, morals and welfare of the inhabitants of the town of Arlington, to lessen congestion in the streets, to conserve health, to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population, to encourage housing for persons at all income levels, to facilitate the adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements, to protect and preserve open space as a natural resource for the conservation of natural conditions for flora and fauna, and to serve as urban amenity for scenic and other aesthetic enjoyment and recreational use, to conserve the value of land and buildings, to encourage the most appropriate use of land throughout the town, to achieve optimum environmental quality through review and cooperation by the use of incentives, bonuses and design review, and to preserve and increase its amenities to encourage an orderly expansion of the tax base by utilization, development and redevelopment of land. It is made with reasonable consideration to the character of the district and to its particular suitability for particular uses with a view to giving direction or effect to land development policies and proposals of the redevelopment board, including the making of our acting a more viable and more pleasing place to live, work and play.</blockquote>

One is there's a missing provision that we often sort of skip over because we deal with the parts without dealing the whole. When you go back to section 3.3.3, before you get to the individual things that the chair just went through, the finding that we have to make the written determination is that the adverse effects of the proposed use will not outweigh its beneficial impacts to the town or neighborhood in view of the characteristics of the site and the proposal in relationship to that site. And that basically is a 3.3.3 consideration. Some extent it overlaps. In this particular case, it overlaps with the provisions regarding harmony and the special regulation itself. But one of the things I think that we should recognize is that some of what they've done or what they're proposing to do that has been approved by the historical commission is a plus. And we shouldn't, the issue here is not whether this is irredeemably bad, although maybe if you live right behind it, that's the issue. The issue really is if we're at 3.3.3 is a balance. And I think that we need to take, if we're going to do that, to take the plus side into effect as well. As you know, from what I've said earlier, where I actually come out on that, but in terms of the analysis, I think that we need to pay and give consideration to the standard that was set forth in the beginning of section 3.3.3. When we get to the question of consistency with the bylaw, there are so many policies that are in the bylaw in the language that the chair just read that you can almost always find that something is inconsistent in one way or consistent in another. It doesn't give you very much guidance. The only thing that we've talked about so far, which I'm a little bit dubious about is what Mr. DuPont mentioned about the use of land. I'm a little bit unclear what that was ever supposed to mean, but when you look at the GIS map here, most of the embedders have got more lot coverage than would be true here if they built the proposal that they have. So it actually, in terms of using land, they may not be unusually voracious, and I would be a little hesitant to rely on that as a factor. It seems to me that you get all the where you need to go in asking yourself what harmonious means for purposes of the special regulation relating to large additions. Much of the testimony has been to that. I think that that is the place where you both have an adverse effect that outweighs beneficial impacts, as well as a failure to actually meet the admittedly stringent requirements of the large addition bylaw.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Anything further from the board? Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. So I'm not sure that this is something that the applicant wants to consider, but I think oftentimes when we've reached this point and it looks like there is a trend in one direction with regard to a special permit, it's sometimes raised as a question for the applicant as to whether or not they want to proceed with the vote and realizing that, you know, should it be denied that then they are foreclosed for a period of two years before they can come back. And sometimes applicants have chosen in the past to amend what they are putting forward with no guarantee that it will be any more acceptable to the board, but at least to the board, it's not acceptable to the board, but at least I think it's something that they might want to know is a possibility. So I just offer that up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that would be a good idea. If we could meet back and I could discuss it further with my architect, if the board would be willing to do that, if we could revisit it maybe on March 12th.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we could, let me grab my calendar. So we could certainly continue March 12th would be, there'll be four weeks from now, I believe it's four weeks. We're in February. Yeah, so it's four weeks from now. So that would work. And I think you've received enough feedback already to sort of the sense around as to what the issues might be. And so appreciate your willingness to come forward and to want to take a look at some additional options. So I do see that one member of the public has raised their hand. The public comment period is closed at this point, but this hearing will be continued. And so when it does continue on the 12th, it will be available for public comment again at that time. So I apologize that we can't take your comment at this moment. So then the request that's in front of the board right now would be a request to continue. So this would be a motion to continue. The special permit hearing for 165 Franklin Street to Tuesday, March 12th, 2024 at 7.30 PM. Unless there's anything further from the board, I would look for a motion. Mr. Chairman, so moved. Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. So this is a vote of the board to continue the special permit hearing for 165 Franklin Street. Tuesday, March 12, 2024 at 7.30 p.m. Roll call vote of the board. Mr. DuPont? Aye. Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Mr. Hawley? Aye. Mr. Riccardelli? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. And the chair votes aye. We are continued on 165 Franklin Street until March. Thank you all very much. Thank you to the applicant and their consultants. Thank you very much to the members of the public who stayed throughout this hearing. I appreciate your contributions and your particular knowledge as it relates to this particular hearing. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. So this brings the board, unfortunately, back to the administrative items which we glossed over at the front and moved to the back side of the meeting.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 377</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I will go back to our official agenda. So we will go back to agenda item number two, which is the approval of the decision for docket 377649 Dixon Avenue. This was written jointly by myself and Mr. Hanlon, distributed to the board for comments, and brought forward in a final version today. I will note there is an additional condition in the application above and beyond what we had discussed at the prior hearing. Upon further review of the application, we realized in discussions with the inspector of buildings that the proposed deck on the Wheeler Lane side, where it was extended 10.3 feet from the building, actually was an issue. And unfortunately, the way the bylaw is written, it requires a variance to make that any larger than 10 foot even. And so the building department spoke with the applicant. The applicant agreed that it would decrease the width of the deck, excuse me, to 10 foot even on the Wheeler Lane side. And so a condition was added to the to the decision that essentially to paraphrase in taking into account what we have in condition number one, that what is submitted has to be built, that the deck would be 10 foot zero instead of the previously listed 10 foot three. And so that it's friendly to the applicant, and the building department is okay with it. And we have asked council and council has said that it is okay the way we're doing it. And so I just wanted to make sure that everyone's aware of that change in the final version of the decision. So but this only applies to a certain number of us because I think there are only not as many people voting on this one. So may I have a motion to approve the written decision? I'm sorry, are there any other questions or comments as regards to 49 Dixon Avenue? Seeing none, can I have a motion to approve the written decision for 49 Dixon Avenue? Chairman so moved. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. So a vote of those members voting on the initial decision. Mr. DuPont? Aye. Mr. Hanlon? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. Holley? Aye. The chair votes aye. That written decision is approved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, great. I was just looking up the building permit that's been issued, and with a condition that it did. The issue was that they wanted to add a second driveway. The building department is not allowing them to do the second driveway as a condition of it. So okay. Special permit. Sounds good. Thanks so much. Appreciate that. Well, I would like to thank you all for your participation in tonight's meeting of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. I appreciate everyone's patience throughout the meeting. I'd especially like to thank Colleen Ralston and Mike Cunningham for their assistance in preparing for and hosting this online meeting.

If anyone has comments or recommendations, please send them via email to zba at town.arlington.ma.us. That email address is also listed on the Zoning Board of Appeals website. And to conclude tonight's meeting, I would ask for a motion to adjourn. So moved, Mr. Chairman. Second. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. Vote of the board to adjourn. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Hanlon. Aye.
