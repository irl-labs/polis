<details><summary>Please, summarize the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.</summary>

> The Zoning Board of Appeals meeting, chaired by Christian Klein, was held on November 14th, 2023. The meeting began with a roll call of all members and officials, including Roger DuPont, Patrick Hanlon, Ben Catulli, Daniel Riccadeli, Elaine Hoffman, Adam LeBlanc, Colleen Ralston, and Mike Cunningham. The meeting was conducted remotely in accordance with an act signed into law on March 29th, 2023. The board discussed docket 3770-4042 Dorothy Road, with Gabrielle Geller representing Erica Schwartz and the housing corporation. The board also discussed potential changes to the zoning bylaws, including the difference between attached and detached buildings, re-lettering the section on accessory dwelling units, and the average setback exception to the minimum front yards. The board also discussed the need for feedback from applicants to improve the application process. The next meeting was scheduled for November 28th.

> The proposed changes for the Dorothy Road project include reducing the footprint of the accessory dwelling unit (ADU) to 900 square feet and the height to 20 feet to comply with zoning regulations. The front setback was adjusted to 12 feet to align with existing conditions. The parking spots were moved and two spots were proposed to be parked parallel to the front yard. The side setback was requested to be moved to three feet, 10 and a half inches, and the rear setback from the lot line was proposed to be an average of six foot nine inches, with the closest point being five feet and a half inch. The existing garage would be demolished and replaced with a passive house zero, a net zero energy ADU. The board members raised concerns about the exterior cladding or siding, the space below the first floor and the ground, and the impact of the modification to the mechanical spaces on the wiring and utilization of the solar panels. The board also discussed the need for a condition regarding the parking.

> The discussion about the variance versus the Special permit for the Dorothy Road project revolved around the board's concerns that the criteria required for a variance could not be met for this property. The board asked the applicant to reconsider their proposal so that a variance would not be required. The applicant was able to address all the points raised by the board, leading to the conclusion that a variance was no longer necessary. This left the board with the question of a Special permit. The applicant needed to satisfy several points for this, including a reduction in the side yard setback and the allowance of an accessory dwelling unit within six feet of the property line. The board had to determine that these changes were not significantly more detrimental to the neighborhood than the current condition.
</details><details><summary>List and summarize each board member's proposed changes to the zoning bylaws.</summary>

> 1. Christian Klein: Proposed changes to the bylaw regarding the difference between a building being attached and detached, and also suggested re-lettering the section on accessory dwelling units for clarity. He also flagged the residential parking section as needing serious consideration.

2. Patrick Hanlon: Suggested the board should consider the flood and wetland provisions of the bylaw, which he believes may not be up-to-date or conducive to an effective program. He also proposed creating a series of instructions or guidance documents to help applicants navigate the new online application system.

3. Roger DuPont: Pointed out potential confusion in the zoning bylaw regarding accessory dwelling units and setback requirements. He suggested tidying up the language in these sections to make it clearer for applicants.

4. Daniel Riccadelli, Elaine Hoffman, and Adam LeBlanc did not propose specific changes to the zoning bylaws in the provided context.
</details><details><summary>Detail the discussion and concerns about the online permitting portal.</summary>

> The board discussed the new online permitting portal and its impact on the application process. They noted that the new system is not as clear as the previous paper system, particularly when it comes to calculations. Many applicants, especially homeowners who are not architects or contractors, have had difficulty understanding how to calculate certain aspects of their applications. The board suggested creating a guidance document to help applicants navigate the new system. They also discussed the possibility of conducting surveys to get feedback from applicants about their experience with the new system. The board also noted that the new system does not currently allow for online applications for appeals or comprehensive permits.
