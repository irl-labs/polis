<details><summary>18 Robin Hood Road - Docket #3757</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 109</summary>

> So, this evening, I apologize I have a conflict with a work. I need to be on a different zoom call for a different zoning Board of Appeals, starting at 815. So we're going to take items out of order. We will do the administrative items at the very end, but we're going to start with docket 3757 18 Robin Hood Road, and then move on to Oakland Avenue. After that, because I am not eligible to vote on Oakland Avenue. So with that in mind, if I could have the applicants for 18 Robin Hood Road, introduce themselves, and let us know what they would like to do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 614</summary>

> Hi, everyone. My name is Joe, a Louie up my life, my wife Caroline. We live as you mentioned that 18 Robin Hood Road, and we have a garage with an unfinished. The second floor of the garage was built in 2021. And we'd like to convert the unfinished. Second floor of the garage into an ad you. Hey, um, would you like me to go ahead and share the drawings that you submitted. Sure, that'd be great. Do that. This is the elevation. The drawings of the garage, I would note that the garage does not stand proud of the ground the ground level plane is not shown in this drawing. I did submit some actual pictures of the garage. In, I think in a word doc, there is, there's two pictures of the garage that I, I submitted if not I can certainly share it on my on my screen but the garage is built. You're right, it is, you know, that's the foundation, this is the, the architectural drawing so to speak of the garage, the door is certainly flush with the ground. And then, so this is the first floor of the garage. And, yes, with the stair that leads up to the, the upper floor is the lower floor going to remain a garage. Yeah, yep. Sorry, direction whoops. This is the upper floor level. The top of the stair and then we have a proposed build out that we submitted as part of the plans. Fortunately, I don't think we might be in a separate document. It may have been, I'll pull up the document name right here. Oh, I did submit these electronically also. Oh no it's a word doc word doc that is second floor build out plan. Okay, we'll go through these and then check and see if, if I have then also calling if you could check and see if you have that. So the front of the garage faces Parker Street. The lot that we're on faces both Robin Hood road which is our address 18 Robin Hood road and on Parker Street in the garage doors are accessed through Parker Street. And that's a section through section to the back showing the stairs section front to back. Okay. framing plans. I think there's one of my neighbors Doug Turner, I just noticed he was in the waiting room. So, in the plot plan. There's one correction here. Okay. See where it says the proposed garage is either private way. It's actually three feet off of the property line because of utility lines. We had the garage away from the utility lines. So the garage fit sits back off the property line three feet, but on the Parker roadside, it is on the property line that's on the property line against the town of Arlington property. Yes. against the private way you're saying it is three feet. So I guess in this plan it would be south so three feet south of its current location, because of the utility lines, there's a, if you look at the picture there's a utility pole right on the corner. Okay. Yeah, there it is. Yep. Okay. So the garage. Steve was was recently rebuilt is my understanding that prior structure was condemned and this was allowed to be built in its place. There was, there was a garage on the property at some point but it hadn't been on the property for 50 years as far as I know, when we bought the house, there was no garage there was just a slab. So that is a new construction garage. Okay. I'm like this lab. Yep.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 12</summary>

> Yeah. And how long have you been on the, on the house,
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 9</summary>

> we purchased the house in 2005 July of 2005.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 161</summary>

> Okay. So the request before the board is to convert the upper floor into an accessory dwelling unit. As most people know sort of accessory dwelling units if they are part of the house can be approved by right. If they are within an accessory structure, and they're within six feet of the property line they need to get a special permit from the, from the zoning Board of Appeals, and the zoning Board of Appeals needs to make a couple of additional findings. In regards to the application. So the, the structure of the garage. For the most part, you know doesn't really impact us the the layout of the accessory dwelling unit itself as long as the, it meets the requirements under the bylaw. The question that I have a few questions but just the one that relates directly to the accessory dwelling unit. So, the exit from the accessory dwelling unit does not go directly to the outside.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 6</summary>

> It only goes to the garage.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 66</summary>

> Yes, believe it should have an exit that goes to the, it should not have to go through another space that's not theirs to exit. So I think you need you, you can work that out with the building inspector but I think you will need to modify the exit, so that they, the resident can enter and exit without having to go through the garage.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 2</summary>

> Understood. 
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 30</summary>

> Mr. Please. Also you can't have an egress through garage in the building code, so they will have to provide a door directly to the outside regardless. Great, thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 5</summary>

> Thank you for that clarification.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 8</summary>

> Are there questions from the board about the.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 38</summary>

> I guess I should also ask the applicant just to confirm you are resident in the building and the main house at this time, and that you would be renting out the accessory dwelling unit is that correct.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 7</summary>

> Yes. Well, yes, or a family member.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 15</summary>

> Yeah, okay. Are there questions from members of the board in regards to the application.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 67</summary>

> Mr Chairman, Mr Hamlin. I wanted just to explore the running a little bit I gather that the running isn't necessarily expected to be the permanent situation and I was wondering if the applicant has any plans to be running that out as a short term rental, or whether he's looking for a longer term tenant under at least what, what kind of running is he imagining.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 49</summary>

> Yep. I understand that a short term rental is not possible as in the bylaws for an ADU so if we choose to rent it, it would only be a long term rental. The long term plan for the ADU is as a space for my son. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 7</summary>

> Thank you. Other questions from the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 214</summary>

> Mr chairman. So I just had a couple of questions I had driven by, and I know that on the side where you're making reference to there having to be a door. I noticed that there was some sort of a deck. And I didn't know where a door would go. In reference to the deck that joins the garage that is between the house, and the garage so I wanted to clarify that, because I believe the deck, so as you're in the top and the top drawing that you had just a moment ago, where you show the elevation. It looks to me like there's deck in the area that would be where the door would come down if you ran it directly from the stairs, and I might be wrong about that I just can't remember exactly so I was wondering about whether or not there is actually a place to put a door there. That's my, my first question. And I guess the second question is that in terms of there being some additional drawings for the dwelling unit portion of this. Do we know what the square footage is going to be on that so that we know whether or not it meets the requirements of the ad you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 12</summary>

> Yep, I believe the square footage is is just under 600 feet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 74</summary>

> And then so the Mr Chairman so we would just want to know that, based upon the, the bylaw, then you would have to just determine that the square footage of the, the, I guess the gross floor area of the house itself was at least what 1200 square feet 900 900 is the maximum. Right, but it can be no more than 5050% of whatever the total gross floor area of the houses.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 8</summary>

> Yeah, the house is approximately 2200 square feet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 40</summary>

> Okay, so it looked like it was well within that. But getting back to the door I just still have a question about where the door is going to come out. If you have to go directly to the outside.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 180</summary>

> Yep, I, to be honest, I wasn't aware of that requirement it wasn't in any of the paperwork that we that we had access to. So, the option. I guess, I guess my question would be, we could go directly out to the deck and just cut into the deck to put a full size door there, or there's a, there's a, there's a existing French door in the back. And I could just put up a wall and make that not a garage but an entryway into the, into the dwelling. So I guess those would be the two options that I have. I guess that it was, it wasn't written anywhere, or any of the information I had did not indicate that I could not access to the garage so I would have to either, you know, go out to the deck, or I would have to put up a wall that that separated the garage in, you know, so that I had a entryway. So I would have to go out the French door in the back.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 83</summary>

> Thank you. Yep. I'm going to share something different here. So hopefully you can see a photograph. This is a photograph of a road. Some is Ralston just forwarded along the other that word document so it has this photograph. So just, just as these two photographs and the word file doesn't have a plan. And I think these two photos were also at the end of that other package. Okay. Go back. So are there any other questions from the board. Sure.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 64</summary>

> Just in terms of the three foot setback so is the. I just wanted to ask the applicant so is the 24 by 30 foot dimension listed on the site plan. The same dimension and the whole thing was just shifted three feet away from the private way or did you make the building smaller in order to accommodate those utilities that you mentioned.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 90</summary>

> Actually, good point out so the the dimension of the garage is actually 24 by 34, I believe, I think the. I believe it's four feet longer than we originally proposed, but we did move it back three feet off of the utility line because there's a code that you can't have a window within an arm's length or grabbing distance of utility line. So the whole structure had to move in away from utility line, but the length of the garage is I believe 3430, as it's listed there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 22</summary>

> Okay. So then what you're saying is that the documentation we have that shows the size of the garage is actually incorrect.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 6</summary>

> The plot plan is pre construction.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 102</summary>

> Okay. Yep. So, so Mr Chair, I mean I think that, you know, I'm sure the square footage are fine but because those dimensions are slightly different it might be slightly different than what's listed on the paperwork we have. The plans are 24 by 34. Yeah, the architectural plans are correct that is what was built. And that will all the permits were built all the permits were pulled all of the sign offs, the, the, the, the engineers in the architects drawing are all accurate, the only one that the plot plan. The plot plan that has the proposed garage.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 27</summary>

> That was what we had pulled. I don't know we had that from prior to getting off the permits. I don't have an updated version of that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 9</summary>

> That's helpful. Thank you. Anything further from the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? and Joe Aluia - 454</summary>

> Mr Chairman. I'm just looking at the gross square footage, which is 720 and it's 24 by 30. These should have these 24 by 34 then know that the second floor if you look at the to match the house, the foundation first floor is larger than the second floor. The dormer of the second floor is smaller than the footprint of the garage. And we did that to match the house. So the square foot upstairs is different than the square foot downstairs. Okay, so the 720 that's listed in the application is a reliable number for the gross square footage of the ad use that correct. Let me just make sure that I. Hold on one second, what number are we looking at because in the application it talked about both the size of the building in the size of the building is larger than the size of the, oh, the accessory building is 720 square feet, but that's the floor, not the second floor. I mean, I thought that you just told me that the for the building, it was 20, it was 24 by 34. Yes, but the second floor is not 24 by 34. Okay, but the accessory for the accessory building here, let me just be clear, is, is that the gross floor area of the ad you have what will be the, the ad unit. No. Okay, so let me get my, let me just so I have it clear. Let me get my calculator out to make sure that I'm giving you the correct information. Sorry. And again, the difference is the second floor of the garage is smaller than the first floor of the garage. So the first floor of the garage is 24 by 34. The second floor of the garage, I believe, is 34 by whatever is in the drawings, but it's smaller. Hold on. 24 by 34. Oh, sorry. So yes, it's this sorry about that so that the 24 by 34 is 816 square feet. So the, the second, so that the, the 720 must be the second floor, but there is some unfinished space in the second floor, because it's just the way that was built this, there's a false wall in, there's just unused space up there. And that's why it's smaller than the actual. You know, it's just, it's, it's, there's a new wall with an unused. There's vacant space behind the new wall that is not going to be living space. Thank you. Yep. And again we want we we match the garage to the house so it's, it's not a standard size. You know, the first floor is not the same size as the second floor.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 62</summary>

> So before I open the meeting for public comment I did just want to note the board is in receipt of an email submitted by Teresa Harrington 38 Robin Hood road. I did not see her name on the list for this evening so I just wanted to make sure we included her comments. Go ahead and share this. So just briefly.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 173</summary>

> Yeah, I'm not in favor. As any understanding that the original permit obtained that this ad was going to be for their son Marcus. But now they're changing their plan this doesn't follow the guidelines for a to use renting these units is not in compliance, and it's been very lax making sure homeowners stay true to their original plans. We have one at 44 this time compliance the homeowner has attached the so called old garage was in law apartment. Maybe the town should do a better job enforcing the rules, also rules concerning Airbnbs respectfully Teresa and parents and 28 Robin Hood Road. So we just to briefly address that guidelines for accessory dwelling units do very explicitly allow for the rental of a unit accessory dwelling unit does not have to go to a family member can be rented on the open market as long as the primary residents is is still occupied by an owner of the property. And that's, that was part of the intent of the bylaw.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Public Comments</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 201</summary>

> With that, public questions and comments are taken as they relate to the matter at hand and should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing our decision, members of the public will be granted time to ask questions and make comments, members of the public who wish to speak should digitally raise their hand using the button on believe it's the reactions tab now in the zoom application those calling in by phone please dial star nine to indicate you would like to speak, you'll be called upon by the meeting host, you'll be asked to give your name and address and you'll be given time for your questions and comments. All questions are to be addressed through the chair please remember to speak clearly, anyone wishing to address the board a second time. The chair will allow those visions be for first time to go first, and all public questions and comments. We will keep this open. Let's say 10 minutes or until we've run out of people. So, at this point, I is open for public comment are there members of the public who wish to address this application. We have a hand raised. Mr. Moore.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 250</summary>

> Yes, thank you Mr Steve more people on street. I was looking at the photographs which were attached to the application, or one of the application documents, and I think you have them up briefly. I'm trying to figure out the view that looks down the private way. Looking at the door of the garage, the 2021 plan showed some large trees that were there. They seem to be missing in the photograph or is there something off about the angle I'm looking at you see the one with the garage door to 15 inch trees relatively close to the door and I don't see anything that I asked what happened to those three. These, these trees here adjacent on the budding the private way. Yep. So, at the corner. At the corner, if you go back to the picture with a utility pole was there was a tree at the utility pole I just passed the utility pole that were that were were failing in they were in risk of falling on the, on the, on the utility lines which is the consensus of many of the neighbors including my adjacent neighbor across the way that the tree be removed so that it doesn't cause harm to the, to the utility line, and I'll go one step further in that this year. If you notice down the down the side of the down the side of the garage, you can see that white tree with no leaves on it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 108</summary>

> Unfortunately, had to be cut down this year because it was a dead tree also. So, we did remove prior to construction. One, I mean, the, the one that you see in the picture that has no leaves on it. Unfortunately had to move. We had to remove that this year. It just, it was dead. And the one that was the one that removed by the utility pole. We had removed I, I'm not sure if we did that or if we did that with my neighbor at the end if we shared the cost. But that was removed because it was, it was, it was dying.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 168</summary>

> Chair, the only reason I bring it up is really the garage was built in 2021. These trees died in 2023 or, or between 21 and 23. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm concerned construction led to the decline and failure of just, just to be clear, the tree by the utility pole was taken out years before the construction. The plot plan was from. I think the plot plan. The original plot plan that has the trees on it. I believe that was from 2006. So the trees were there as of 2006, not in 2021 that trees been been gone for a while. Mr. Chair, I would ask if a plan was filed in 2021, or this garage which is 816 square feet which is above the 750 size, requiring tree plans, etc. And that actually leads me to another question which is in 2021, maybe it's my ignorance of the rules here but why was the garage allowed to be up. There it is. Sorry 2020.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 187</summary>

> The garage meets the setback requirement because the exterior walls facing Parker Street and the private way. I guess they're fire rated. And by it there's, you know, the permit allows for building on property line provided that the material used is fire rated. So, this, the, the, the, you know, I noticed a much larger can of worms which we need to discuss. Yep. Well, so this. Technically if you face a road it is the front yard. In this case because this piece of property that that is labeled town of Arlington. So this piece of land actually belongs to the town of Arlington it was taken for non payment of taxes by a prior owner of the property. So, technically, this is a rear corner between a side yard and a rear yard, and so it can the zero setback is allowed. It is required that the construction be of a fire rated construction for a garage. Looking at the construction documents that was not done. It was built using normal stick framing. But that's not an issue before the board at this time.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 40</summary>

> The board is restricted to the question as to whether or not the conversion of the upper floor from its current non use to an accessory dwelling unit is meets the criteria and the findings requirements of the zoning bylaw.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 125</summary>

> I understand Mr Chairman but aren't you furthering a non compliance. That was incurred in 2020 2021. I don't believe there was a non compliance when the garage was built. There wasn't a non compliance with the construction of the garage. As far as I know. So I had, I had discussed this with briefly with the building inspector. The initial question about the this adjacent piece of property. So, the determination from the building inspector was that because there was a garage there before and this was the reconstruction of a garage that that was the reason it was approved as submitted. And that, that was all that's the all I know regards to why it was constructed in the manner it was constructed.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 56</summary>

> There has been a garage there in the past, the cement slab of the garage was still there when we purchase the house, but the garage itself wasn't there, but there had been a garage for a garage had been on the property, you know, as part of the original construction that was a garage there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 147</summary>

> Right. Mr Chairman. If I understand what you're saying is, is that at least with respect to me I think Mr Moore is raising things of raising a question about compliance with the tree by law, which we can get to in a minute. But in terms of just the general compliance with the building code and with the zoning ordinance my understanding is that the building inspector. In 2020 knew everything that we do now. And for reasons which seemed appropriate to him at the time, issued a building permit for the garage to be constructed in the way that it is. I agree with that. And we may rethink that, but if there's a, if that's an issue, presumably, it's because we disagree with the decision of the building inspector and it's not something that would be Mr. Louis fall. I understand Mr. Thank you,
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein and Joe Aluia - 187</summary>

> Mr handling that. It's a situation I just, I will say that surprised. So, sorry to interrupt I will say this if you go back to the, the actual pictures. When the, when the garage was done we actually planted five trees along Parker Street. One maple to birch. What kind of very service service very and magnolia magnolia. So, we actually planted five trees. When the construction was done, and that shown in the side view of the actual picture. There. So we plant five trees across the side. After the construction was done. Okay, I'm sure and that's the land that's owned by the town of Arlington I guess it's not property yes that is yes. Well that that's a, I mean that's a good thing I appreciate that having been done. I'm just surprised that things went forward without questions related to the side on the private road but thank you, Mr. You're welcome. Mr. Mark. Are there any further members of the public who wish to address this application. None, I will go ahead and close the public participation part of the hearing.

> The bylaws. So in any residential district accessory dwelling unit is permitted as an accessory used any single family dwelling two family dwelling or duplex dwelling, if all the following conditions are met. So, these are the requirements that will be reviewed by the building inspector and the zoning enforcement officer as they go forward with with their review of the property, where we are brought in is under this bullet number three and accessory building shall not constitute a principal or main building but incorporation of the accessory dwelling unit, provided that as such an accessory building is located within six feet of a lot line, and such accessory dwelling unit shall be allowed only if the Board of Appeals section 3.3 grants a special permit upon its finding that the creation of such accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the use of such accessory building as a private garage, or other allowed use. And the rest of this is enforceable by the by the building department. So, what the determined that's the determination, the board needs to make that the conversion of the upper floor from its current use to being used an accessory dwelling unit. The board needs to find that the creation of such accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the use of such building as a private garage. And the way that the board has typically made these determinations is with respect to the special permit criteria. 333. There we go. So the use requested is listed as a special permit use and the regulations for the applicable district or so designated in the bylaw, we just reviewed there under section 593 requested use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. The enhancement of property in town, along with the incorporation of additional residences in a way that does not create an undue increase in density is a is essential and desirable to the town question use will not create undue traffic congestion or unduly impaired pedestrian safety. The use of this building as an accessory dwelling unit would would possibly increase the number of cars available by one. It is up to the owner as to how they would handle that requested use will not overload any public water drainage or sewer system or any other municipal system, such an extent that the requested use or any developed use in the immediate area, or any will be unduly subjected to the hazards affecting health self safety or the general welfare, we will be adding a single kitchen and a single restroom, which should not cause any overload. The special way, any special regulation for the use as neighbor by law are fulfilled, and that is that the board would determine that the use as an accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than its current use request use will not impair the integrity or character of the district or adjoining districts. likely anyone would notice that it's been used as a an accessory dwelling unit as opposed to the appearance it has now it is, there are no exterior modifications to the house as a part of this application with the exception as we had discussed about providing proper legal egress and that will be worked out with the building department. And the requested use will not by its addition to the neighborhood cause an excess of the use that could be detrimental to the character of said neighborhood. The incorporation of an accessory dwelling unit in this existing structure would only add one unit to an existing neighborhood, and the lot size that's there currently is fairly small. generous in the neighborhood would not be unduly burdened by the addition of this accessory dwelling unit. I would ask the board if there are any additional questions in regards to this application. Seeing none. Mr. Could I ask one question.

<details><summary>	 ? - 2</summary>

> Yes, please.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 115</summary>

> So, under section 5.9.2, the accessory dwelling unit regulations under B, there's a note about accessory dwelling units being subject to all applicable requirements of state building codes, state fire code, and the openings with being protected, whether they're a certain distance from the property line. So, you know, knowing that the building inspector approved the building permit. I guess I'm just wondering, is it our, is our responsibility to make that determination if, if you feel or we feel that perhaps it's not meeting the fire rating that would be required under our code. Or is it the building inspector already made that determination and now this is allowable because it received a permit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 451</summary>

> So, it's the responsibility of the building department to review the final application for compliance with the state building code. And as such, they will need to make that determination as to whether the, you know, the way the windows are, are in compliance with the building code or if they would need to make some adjustment to that. So, because of the proximity of the structure to the lot line, does that, you know, are there setback requirements that would need to be met in terms of, you know, fire protection, but that would be within, that's not within our purview, that's the purview of the building, the building inspector. But we could put it in as a condition. No, I just, I'm just curious about that, just because it came up here and I think it came up on one previous ADU case where someone was adding to a structure that had been fire rated and they weren't proposing something fire rated. I think we probably have the same question and conversation, but I wanted to be sure. Thank you. And then, unfortunately I do need to run in a second. I do have some concerns about sort of the openness of some of the documentation we have that it's not overly firm as to exactly some of the sizes of things. And we don't have an accurate layout of the upper floor. And so I would put in front of the board at the board, what their consideration would be. If they feel they have enough information or if they would want to request additional information be provided. The other thing I wanted to just briefly. It's not related to our case and what we need to find. But I would just notice, notice for the applicant that that strip of land that belongs to the town of Arlington is the town of Arlington's land, it is not you, it's not your property, but you are using it as your property. I would just caution you that you're doing that at your own risk, that the town can't can you know take possession and take ownership of that land that land was granted to the town of Arlington for non payment of taxes by a prior resident of that house. I would strongly encourage you to discuss that with the town. Whether there's a way that you could either acquire reacquire that piece of land or obtain an easement for access to the garage across that piece of land. But I just caution you that it's the access to the drive access to the garage is entirely off of town's property, and that that's at your own risk.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joe Aluia - 45</summary>

> I completely understand, and I believe the hat we have the easement for the garage for the for the driveway. I can confirm that completely understand that that you know that the land that we've been maintaining for 18 years is not our land. Yep.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 36</summary>

> Okay. Just want to confirm that you're aware of that. Yep. With that I apologize that I do have to run. I will leave this hearing and the capable hands of Mr Hanlon to go forward.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 225</summary>

> Thank you, Mr Klein. So now I get to be. I get to be chair for for a while. So the question that's outstanding is whether we need to have correction of some of the material that is in front of us that shows where that particularly that shows an accurate view of the where the edu unit is, is going to be and provides updated dimensions and clarifies the information that we already have. And I guess that it sort of is up to you whether you need to see anything like that I would encourage us to be thinking about whether that information provided to us, as opposed to putting a condition saying that updated information needs to be provided to inspectional services may cause a waste of our time and other people's time as well unless we think it's genuinely material to our decision in the case. I guess the I think that it would we have in the past, included a condition that says an effect that the applicant will at the time of buying for a building permit update the incorrect all of the, the, the drawings that were are for us. Is that enough or do you want to try for a continuance and get a good look at it yourselves before acting on the case. Let's be sure.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 111</summary>

> I'm sorry I didn't see who said, Adam. I know I'm kind of new here but I don't particularly feel comfortable voting, given the documents we have in front of us, you know, not for sure knowing what the square footage is and then also the, the issue with the separate entrance and egress. I know, you know, we can leave that up to the building inspector but it seems like, given what I've heard tonight there may be a couple of things that have transpired or something, I don't know, be up to what others here. That's kind of my feeling that I would like to see more updated documents.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 21</summary>

> Just to be clear, the only document that we're talking about is the plot plan correct. That's the only documenting question.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 90</summary>

> I think we need to see a layout of the proposed at you as well as what those dimensions are and what the square footage of that is that should be in the construction doc, not the not the layout, but the finished space area should be in the construction doc of the, of the garage the garage plants has a second floor layout with square footage. I'm not convinced of its accuracy based on the architectural drawings, I can't provide anything other than the architectural drawings of the building.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 26</summary>

> What else what what would you propose that I show that has that. What can I show that would be more convincing than the architectural drawing.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 107</summary>

> Well I think my, my thing is, you were saying that the walls of the second floor and set from the building. And that is shown on the, the drawings that I submitted. That's all in there the framing doc show everything dimension. I see on the second floor plan. There's a 24 by 34 foot space, but that doesn't jive with what we're hearing and then what we see. What the second floor. That would be a two when your documents. Yeah, that's the one I'm looking at. And that that's, that's what I'm looking at what's in the agenda, what we have available to us.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 104</summary>

> If there's other things that maybe we're sent that we don't have a virus I can't speak to that but I'm just looking at what I have in front of myself right now. I'm looking for a two, I have a printout of what I submitted in in the printout of what I submitted, I, I thought I had a layout of a two there it is. No, that's the a two is the outside eight to that house. In what I submitted. What I, what I, what I think I submitted had a layout. Apparently it's not in the document that you have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 36</summary>

> Yeah, it's not in the agenda. Did you describe Mr. What, what is the document that you think you have that we're missing what, what, what does it have on it that he does not have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 16</summary>

> I can, if you allow me to share my screen I can show it to you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 25</summary>

> It's Ralston, does he have the permission to do that. Let me look and see whoops. I can't do that. We just. Here we go.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 202</summary>

> This is, this is what I thought I submitted with my paperwork, and you can see where it says attic. Those are the, those are the. So the 24 is minus the two feet so it's 20 by 34. So you have for the setbacks because the outside foundation of the second floor is smaller than the outside foundation that I thought I had submitted this with my paperwork. Yeah, I'll just add to make sure you check what the definition of the gross floor area is and the zoning bylaws because it's, it's a little bit more nuanced than what you just described. Understood. But the entirety of the garage is, even if it was the full footprint of the garage it's still only 816. So it could never be more than 816. Yeah, I guess I can clarify, um, I know I want this to go through I just want to make sure that we're getting accurate information and that the record reflects the correct information that is there. Perfect. So, other than the updated plot plan. And this document that shows the all the measurements in the proposed layout, is there anything else that you would like to see.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 67</summary>

> It would be good to see what the proposal for the separate entrances because that is a requirement of the zoning bylaw that we're looking at, and just want to make sure we see that and I'll leave it up to the building inspector to determine the rest of it in terms of the actual construction of it for its proper fire ratings and all that. Yep.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 159</summary>

> Which is the section of the, of the bylaw that we're looking at. So the separate means of egress thing that's in the building code itself. But the separate entrance is under the 5.9 point to be. It is one and bullet point three. What I'm asking what I'm wondering is if to read that all out, it says an accessory dwelling unit shall maintain a separate entrance, either directly from the outside or through an entry hall or corridor shared with the principal dwelling sufficient to meet the requirements of the state building code for safe egress. So if this was actually in the principal dwelling. Then you could go in through that right so the problem. If there is a problem is just that this is not the principal dwelling the accessory building is, is a garage. And so that's the reason why it is that that there needs to be a separate entrance. I think so.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 131</summary>

> According to zoning point of view, but in a building code point of view, putting on my other hat. You can't egress through a garage. Well, that's fair enough, but I don't, we're not, we're not the zoning, the, the building inspector administrates the building code as a state law and not as a and we don't administer the building code so if it isn't a zoning requirement that I don't really know that we have any, any business, attempting to deal with it. Somebody that's that's a job of a different agency the question really in my mind is whether is, is, is whether that's really a zoning zoning thing as well and I guess here the way it's written, I, I sort of take the view that it is.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 143</summary>

> So, it puts us in an awkward position because of course the, the thing has to be sufficient to meet the requirements of the state building vote for building code for safe egress which puts us right back into dealing with the building code. I certainly feel more comfortable letting Mr Trump and deal with that than, than doing it for our on our own but what I take it that you are looking for Mr LeBlanc is for Mr. Trump to decide what option he wants to take here and see architecturals that show the separate exit, the separate egress. Yeah, I think, just from our zoning point of view of showing the entrance directly from the outside because I believe that's the one applicable to this situation. Let the building inspector deal with the other components related to the building code.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 209</summary>

> Okay, so what we need then, if, if I understand you correctly Mr LeBlanc from from Mr Leah is essentially the document that he's just shown, maybe adjusted in some way if I'm not quite sure what, what aspect of what he's just shown you. I mean, I'm trying to figure out what suppose he just puts in the document that he just said that that he just showed us. He still fairly long distance away from 900. I'm wondering whether we haven't really worked, worked out what this means in terms of the principle to dwelling and so forth, but I think it's where are we getting over 50% probably not that either. I mean, you know, if it's if it's just a matter of understanding just how far as shirts fall short of the minimum, it's a bit much to have them redo the document, unless there's something specific that we can point to that says we don't think that it's that the document is appropriate on this thing or this thing or that. And the other thing is you need you need to show a design that that that is sufficient to as normally given to us that shows where the separate egresses Is that right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 11</summary>

> Is there anything else that you would like him to have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 274</summary>

> Yeah, I think it's, it's mostly that and again just, I understand that the whole square footage thing is basically a non issue but I'm just, I'm just being a stickler. Yeah, so I, you know, I would encourage us. I think that when you do it all correctly that it's uncertain whether or not you'll meet the minimum, the maximum size requirement and we can certainly ask for that. And I, it seems to me that what he's already shown us probably gives us all we need to work with and I'm not sure what we can ask him to do more on the question of the external egress that is something that we haven't even started with so he'd have to produce something more demonstrating that how we did attempt to achieve that. Yeah. Yeah, I'll, I'll let others land. You know, if we do the one if he's got the document that we already have, unless we have reason why we have to ask him to redo it, then he's already got that part so the difficulty is showing where the external egress would be and that requires some more planning and decision on his part, and, and deciding how he wants to do that, and providing us with that document. What The alternative for us asking for it is to rely on Mr champa to enforce the state building code and, and he would presumably do this in in either event. Oh, I wonder if others on the board have a view as to whether they feel that we need to continue this to provide this additional information or not.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Dupont - 223</summary>

> Mr chairman, Mr DuPont. So, this feels a little cumulative to me based upon Mr record Ellie's comments and then Mr were blanks comments and then Mr clients comments. But I guess, in some for me, I mean, I, first of all, I believe that based upon the application itself, the gross floor area is established. Whatever that number is, because my I think. My first concern going in is just making sure. That it comports with that, you know, no larger than 50% or 900. Square feet. Whichever is smaller. And if the other members of the border and agreement, I think that that's been established. With the application itself. So I, I, I take that as sort of step one. I'm not sure. I would say we need clarification for. The layout in the square footage of the living space. I suppose I'd be comfortable if there was just a requirement that this plan that Mr. Louia has. Provided to us was provided for the record to supplement the record. I think that's a good point. And I think that, you know, the whole idea of the egress gets pulled back into this portion of the zoning bylaw. By virtue of reference to the building code, if, if that's correct, I guess, I guess it is. Is that correct? Mr. LeBlanc.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 7</summary>

> So. Yeah, it seems kind of circular.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Dupont - 248</summary>

> Yeah. I mean, I mean, I think it's a good idea to have a plan. With the layout of the floor and then, you know, a plan that would be submitted to the. Inspectional services showing egress. In conformity with the provisions of this bylaw and the state building code. I mean, that gives Mr. Champa enough of a roadmap. To be able to say, oh, okay, well, here's what I got to do. I'm sure he knows that already. And I think that's a good idea. I mean, I think that's a good idea to have a plan that would be able to submit a plan to a decision if we're inclined to do so. And then just sort of move ahead. If other members of the board are comfortable with that. And in the last. Point I will make. And I think that Mr. Hanlon's already addressed this is, you know, we need to stick to those things that are in front of us, but I do have a concern. And I do think that it raises an issue, but I don't think that it affects the use as a dwelling unit and accessory dwelling unit. So I'm willing to forego that as a concern or discussion. But I do think it raises an issue that needs to be dealt with. Down the line. So I'm generally comfortable moving ahead. With the submission of the plan showing the layout and then the Submission of the plan.

<details><summary>	 Mr. Holly - 374</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Mr. Holly. Just to add to what Mr. DuPont was mentioning. The. About that lot piece of land owned by Arlington. We are in this, in this hearing, looking at. A conversion of a. An existing. Dwelling structure. Right. So. We are looking at. Kind of conformity or non-conformity of the existing structure in a way. So. Should we look into the. Dwelling structure, the accessory structure. Relative to that lot line or not is more a question there. As a point, I don't know if Mr. DuPont. My understanding is that Mr. Klein has discussed that with. Counsel who has indicated that this is an issue that the applicant ought to be taking up separately with the town as the older owner of that strip. And recognize both. The jeopardy is added and. And attempting to come to some sort of an agreement to. I think. As a lawyer too, I, I would. Hesitate for us to be attempting to get into. The property issue that is at stake here. And don't believe that there's anything in that, that would prevent us from approving. This application. And, and I don't think that. Mr. Heim thinks so either. I agree. The only part where I. I don't think there's anything in that that would prevent us from approving. The application. The accessory structure. He's at a zero property line right now. And not the table dimensional table required. Whatever 25 feet, but that is an existing non-conformity in a way for us at this time, at this juncture, it is an existing non-conforming. And I'm not even sure what to do about that. And. But don't think that it is the function of this board to try to figure that out. The question for the. Notice that the. The business about fire rating is a, is both a building code issue and it's, it's a question that has to do with the location of the garage as such. There's no equivalent provision in. So in the ADU bylaw.With that says, just says, if you're within six feet, you need a special permit. And then we have to apply the criteria that we. Right. Right. So, sorry. This is the last one.

<details><summary>	 Joe? - 127</summary>

> If I may share my screen quickly. The section where. The request for their application has this comment. I was just trying to understand this. So. This is. Section 5.9 0.2. B one, three.

The request for their application has this comment. I was just trying to understand this. So. Which requires. It requires that. It requires that the by right, ADU conversion must be a minimum of six feet from the property line and that the proposed ADU is closer than. So, so the. The premise is that it is.

<details><summary>	 Mr. Holly - 36</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 172</summary>

> So, Mr. Something close to this is at the time of building. Building permit, I believe it was. I believe it was. It was going compliance with section. 9.2. B one about bullet three. Inconformity with this byline with the state building code. Is that basically right? Yes. I bollocks that up a little bit, but. Okay. So I guess the question that I'd like. I think that we need to continue and see that all of that himself. And carry this agenda over till. The next meeting when we can, when we can address this. Which I think will be August 29th. Or whether we're satisfied with Mr. DuPont's condition. I personally would. Think that. That we don't. You know, I don't think that it will influence our, if assuming that. Assuming that the, that, that the. Applicant shows what the condition says that he needs to show. Are seeing it first. Is not likely to add to the quality of the decision as compared to Mr. Champa doing it. Okay.

<details><summary>	 Mr. Rickardelli - 60</summary>

> Mr. Mr. Rickardelli. I agree. I think. You know, I would hate to hold the applicant up. I think. I think that I would be, you know, I'm in favor. Of the application. And I think. Provided that they submit. The plan that we were just shown. And, and, and, and, and. Crafted. I think. That I would be comfortable.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 236</summary>

> Right. I need to, I need to ask your forbearance. And if you could give me about a minute for a break, I need to. I need to. To do this. It's. I think it was that one where. I think it was that one where the question came up having to do with where the. With where the, with what the average. Finished grade was. And the applicant added provided additional. Information that was later submitted for the record. And I would propose that rather than waiting until Mr. Louie formally. Submits the document that we've seen, if that document is all that's necessary. That we proceed at least to act. In that connection and then. I think that's the, the, the, the, the. The condition that, that, that we have. Since the document is in existence and. Really just needs to be there in order to make the record. The record accurate and make it easy for people to find. The document that. That we're actually. Are relying on if we are inclined to improve. To improve the application. So. There's nothing more. The. I suppose that. If the board is, is inclined to approve this application, it will want to do that. And. With the three. Standard conditions. And I'm looking hard for a copy of those for me to. Okay. I need to split my screen. Here we go. Okay. All right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 360</summary>

> So the three standard conditions. Are. As follows. The final plans and specifications approved by the board for the permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington. In connection with this application for zoning relief. There should be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington zoning board of appeals. The second deals with enforcement. The building inspector is hereby notified that he is to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time that he determines that violations are present. The building inspector shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw under the provisions of chapter 40, section 21 D. And institute non-criminal complaints. If necessary, the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action. Also in accordance with section 3.1. And the final one is the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to this special permit grant. In addition to that, Mr. DuPont has proposed. Condition that would say in substance at the time of building. Building. A building permit approval. The applicant shall submit. Or the plan that shows. The zoning bylaw. Egress. In accordance with section. B one bullet three of those, of the zoning bylaw. And conformity with the state building code. Yes. Does Eddie, is there a, are there any other conditions that. Mr. Mr. Chairman, I don't know if it was a condition, but we did. Agree that he will submit the floor plan. That we viewed. Moments ago. So I don't know if that was something. Yeah. I mean. I wondered. Why don't we just make indication. Make it a condition at the time of building inspection and at the time of the building permit. The plan that. A two. Shall be submitted as part of, as part of the. Or shall be submitted to the building inspector. Sounds good. Okay. Mr. Lewis should provide a copy of that for the record in this case. Okay. We won't delay decision on that. All right. So that should be the fifth decision. The. The fifth condition.

<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 246</summary>

> Is, are there, is there anything else? Okay. The chair will entertain a motion. Mr. Chairman. Mr. LeBlanc. Motion for the ADU be approved. Subject to the three standard conditions and the two additional conditions that. The chair just enumerated. Is there a second. Second. Seconded by Mr. LeBlanc. We'll do a roll call. Well, let me see if I can. Mr. Dupont. Aye. Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. Who am I missing? Mr. Holy. Mr. Holy. There you are. And the chair votes. Aye. So, thank you, Mr. Lee. You've got some additional things that you will need to provide for the building inspector, but if you could file the. The additional documents. So that we can have it in the record. We would greatly appreciate it. Yep. I will send that through. Can I send that through email? Do you need a printed copy?  No, you can send it to me. All right. I will send that through email tomorrow. And I think there was one other outstanding. Well, I get a. Communication of some sort that says what the other outstanding item is. I think it was final plans approved by. I was writing it down, but I just want to make sure I understand. Okay. The material that will be provided to the building inspector. Oh, got it. Okay. Perfect. Okay. All right. So I'll send the plans out. I'll email them right now. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

<details><summary>14 Oakland Avenue - Docket 3754</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 21</summary>

> All right. So we're now ready to. Turn to. The second hearing on our, our list. Mr. Hanna. Yes. Mr. Hanna.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 1178</summary>

> Yes. Okay. I am here this evening with. My two clients. David. And Catherine. And also with Alexander. The architect. Now you may recall at the last hearing. I made a statement. And the chair brought to my attention. The fact that there had been. Two cases decided. At the last zoning hearing. That might have a bearing. On what I was trying to achieve. With that. I requested that the matter. Be continued. I have read both. And I did submit a memo to. The members of the board, which hopefully you've received. By the way, along with. Many, many. Emails from neighbors. Who are in favor of what is being proposed by. My clients. The, the case that I looked at. Very carefully. Was a 48 Oakland. And. The 48 Oakland. Was a bit different than my case. In that. 48 Oakland. Was decided. Under section 1.8. I started at 8.1 0.3. And as you may recall. 8.1 0.3. Under section 1.8. They essentially said. That if you were doing an addition. Completely within the foundation. Then you probably did not need. Zoning relief. Because you essentially. We're conforming. And the chair. Did. In the 48 Oakland. Decision did. And the homeowners in that case. Indicated that. The lot was conforming. Even though they had three stories. And they had three stories. But the entire addition. Was going to occur within the foundation. The, my case involved. A situation where the addition. Was not going to occur. And so. I had to look to. Sub paragraph B. Now it's interesting also to note that. When I applied for. My relief. I applied for relief. Under the dimensional. Provision in the bylaw. For a special permit. also applied for a variance. I conceded very quickly to points made by, I believe, Mr. DuPont and perhaps Mr. Hanlon as well, that in fact, I would never be able to establish uniqueness relating to my variance request. I conceded that, and if you're familiar with Oakland AB, you can see why I would have conceded that. Because quite frankly, a lot of the houses on Oakland AB are similar. The characteristics are similar as well. I wrote a memo or a brief to the board. Essentially, what I talked about in that brief was that the board in the 48 Oakland AB case decided to hear that case under the provisions of sub-paragraph B, despite the fact that the applicant in that case probably did not even need relief because again, they were building their addition within the foundation. But I went on to quote from some of the comments made in that case. One of the comments that again was made was we're going to decide the case using the parameters of sub-paragraph B. Again, I don't have that in my case. However, what I do have is I have everything else, I believe. I have the design standards that we'd be complying with. We're in R1 zone. We're not really introducing an addition to the neighborhood that is much different than a lot of the other houses in the neighborhood. Indeed, one of the e-mails which you received from an owner at 10 Oakland AB basically talked about the fact that she did pretty much what my client is attempting to do now 25 years ago. She was able to build it 25 years ago. As we all know, there are statute of limitations that apply as well as a 10 and a six-year statute of limitations. Even if a building had been built years ago without reference to building plans, if 10 years go by, the building inspector cannot go ahead and stop that building from continuing to exist. Again, I had facts that were very similar. Now, the one issue I did have was, of course, that I had not filed under 8.3.1. I argue in my memo that that shouldn't make any difference. Because when I applied for relief, I applied for relief under the dimensional aspects of zoning by-law. That told the world and put the world on notice that my client was seeking to put an addition on their home. That was notice. Indeed, historically, I go back a long way with the zoning board. Historically, years ago, if in fact a property had been advertised as a variance, if in fact the board decided to and not advertised as a special permit, if the board decided to go along with granting a special permit, since the greater relief had been advertised, the boards historically in prior years would conclude and did conclude that nevertheless the matter could go forward because the relief being sought by way of a special permit was less relief than that being sought by way of a variance. What I'm here to argue, and I'm going to have Mr. Alexander Booth talk with you in a few minutes as well. What I'm here to argue is that we feel we fit within the language of subparagraph B. I think subparagraph B was put in the by-law for a reason. It was put in the by-law for precisely the kind of a situation we're talking about. My client's home was built in 1939. It goes way back. Again, building inspectors over the years had an opportunity to come to the owners of the property from 1939 on and say, look, you got three stories. You shouldn't have three stories, and shut them down. That never happened. So that ability on the part of the building inspector would be foreclosed at this point. With respect to how this addition would fit into the neighborhood, I feel that it would fit in very nicely in the neighborhood. In my memo, I argue about the characteristics of Oakland Ave, starting down the bottom, going up to the top, how the houses, to some extent, a bit varied, but in many respects, very similar. What my client is proposing is not substantially different than what would exist in the neighborhood now and even after the fact. I think that argument falls within the four corners of the language in subparagraph B. Query, is the applicant's proposal going to be substantially different than what is in the neighborhood, and will it be a detriment to what is in the neighborhood? My argument to you is that that is not the case. Now, that having been said, why don't I let the real person who knows more about this than I do, the architect maybe say some words to you as well. Mr. Inessi, let me just sort of- By the way, can I just say this, Mr. Hanlon? I did reach out to the building inspector about the issue I talked about in terms of whether I should go forward. You're re-noticing it. I never heard back. Whether I should withdraw it and file a new. I said to myself, why not go ahead before the board? I've not heard from the building commissioner, let's get before the board. That's what I've done.

<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 139</summary>

> I'm sorry. Let's just back up for a second and remind ourselves where we currently stand. Last time when we started, I don't think we got very far into, and we probably need some reflection. We need some refreshment of our recollection of exactly what the proposal is and how the layout is and what it looks like and that sort of thing. But the initial question, the threshold question was whether or not this is introducing a new non-conformity or whether or not it's the extension of an existing non-conformity. That in turn depends upon whether the existing house is two stories or three stories. I take it from your submissions that your view at this point and what you're submitting to us is that it's three stories. What we're talking about is the extension of a non-conformity.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 326</summary>

> Correct. I do know from Mr. Champa that that is the view of the building department that it is currently a three-story. You've submitted for the record two other things that tend to show that. One is a plot plan dated in 2022 as opposed to 2020, which is the original one you used in which the surveyor said it's three stories. You also have got several drawings that do not exactly calculate the average grade, but I think are supposed to be show to us exactly why it is that the basement does count as a story because the ceiling is more than four feet six inches above the average finished grade. That's the evidence that we have to rely on. If we agree with you that the existing building is a three-story, then it seems to me clear that section 8.1.3B potentially applies, in which case the standard that we have to apply is whether or not the extension of the non-conformity is more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing non-conformity, which we normally do by looking at the usual special permit criteria to inform that decision. Legally, that's where we are. The first thing, I guess, is to make sure that we're satisfied, that we know enough to conclude that the building inspector is right, that this is three stories to start with. Then we're into essentially looking at the usual special permit considerations in terms of we know what authorizes the special permit, that would be 8.1.3B, and then we have the various criteria that you've addressed. Let me just ask the board members if that seems clear enough to them and whether this would be a good time to turn to Mr. Vu and some pictures and to get more into the details. Does anyone on the board have any further questions? I mean, there'll be lots of times for further questions, but let's let Mr. Vu do his thing.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Alexander Vu - 189</summary>

> Can you hear me? Yes, we can hear you. Great. So is there drawings that you have or should I share my screen? You should share your screen. Share my screen, okay. Can you see my screen? Yes. Great. So I think we all agree that it's for now the existing non-conforming three stories, and we design or addition an extension of non-conforming three stories. We're proposing to do a 18 by 17 footprint of a low first floor recreational space off of the existing unfinished basement. And it's a very simple box where also the design is to extend the design intent of the existing house into the non-conforming three story. And all this, the additions is all within the setbacks and meets all the requirements of the site plan. This is a second floor. We call it the second story. A family room extension off existing living room, kitchen, and dining. And it's 19 by 18. And the third story is off the existing third story bedrooms, floor, fourth bedroom, bathroom, and extending extension down to the back. So that's our three stories, floor plans. Any questions?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 54</summary>

> So this is in these drawings, Oakland Avenue is to the left, correct? Yes. And this is located in the rear yard? Yes, extension. So tell us a little bit about the where, how far is, what is the depth of the rear setback here? The site plan, do we have a site plan?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Robert Annese - 293</summary>

> I think in the tabulation, it says something like 59 feet. It's a, yes, it's a very deep backyard. It's at least, yes, on the over survey plot plan. Yeah, it's a, it's a, it looks like a double lot, very long. And then what is, what is located behind that? I mean, I take it as another lot that is on Harvard street. And how far is the, is the structure in that from the, from the rear lot line? I mean, I guess you. If, if the owner is here, Ms. Beecher, or may actually have a better feel for how far away her neighbor in the back is than, than any of us, Mr. Hamlin, I'm not a good judge of distance, but I would say it's approximately 100, 125 feet or so. It's, can you see that the plot plan? I'm sharing with you. I do see the plot plan. Yeah. So, so the, apologize. I took me a while to find this. So the back corner of the left, the North back corner of the house, the two-story house, it's 70 yards from the back corner to the property, the rear property line. Right. And we're extending out, we're proposing sending out 18, 18 feet. Right. From 70 feet. And the question we're addressing now is the lot in the back, which is for the record, 11 Harvard street is also quite a deep lot before you get to the structure on it. And I'm trying to get an estimate about how deep that is. And I, I think Mr. Turnquist suggested that it was, it was deep. He guessed maybe a hundred feet or so, but, but it's certainly, it's not close. Is that correct?  Yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 625</summary>

> Yes. All right. I think that's fair. What is the total square footage of this edition? The total square footage. Let's see. I believe we have, I think we have it in our application. It's on your dimensional form. And the dimensional form, I think. Yes. It's on the dimensional form. So it's. I guess if you subtract 2221, which is the existing from the proposed 3211, you get nine 90. Is that correct? I think we're close. So that's more than 750. And I'm wondering whether you also need a special permit for a large edition. If that's the case, we certainly do. Now I do notice one thing and which may complicate things a little bit, and maybe we should just kind of assume that you're going to be, we're going to look at that criteria as well. But there's a, if I'm not mistaken, in the back, there is an overhang, a room that is, I think, on the second floor that extends out in the back. It's supported by, it's supported by pillars. And you can see it in the pictures that were submitted by the original application. If you look sort of, the first one kind of shows where this looks and then the last one shows it sticking out there. And if that's a preexisting building within the foundation, maybe that gets subtracted out. I'm a little bit unclear of what we're really actually dealing with here. See, these are the proposed elevations so that they're going to show you what you're going to do. And it would have been helpful, I think, to have elevations showing the existing situation as well. But you can see in the plot plan, a reference, an indication of where the one-story overhang is. And the question is whether there's any possibility that that brings you under 750. But I will say this, that the criteria, in this particular case, the criteria for the large addition would not be a great deal different than the one for a special. So we may want to just go back, just assume that this is a large addition and proceed accordingly. So in the new drawings that you submitted, there are some, I just wanted to make sure that the record, that they're sort of explained for the record, but they purport to show that this as is, they are evidence that this really is a three-story building now. And I wonder if either you or Mr. Inessi wants to walk us through those and show how that works. How it works? Yeah, I will say that the drawings that I saw don't really contain a specific, I mean, they kind of, you look at it and can sort of tell that it looks like a third story because of the four and a half feet difference but average finish grade isn't calculated. So I'm a little bit, I think that some explanation would be useful. Those would be in the new drawings that were submitted after the, in the last few days in preparation for this hearing and not in preparation for the hearing before. Lou, can you do that? Yeah, so the exposed lower level called the basement, existing basement, it's over two-thirds, In terms of linear feet, then the area that is covering up the upper level, up the yard adjacent to the street, Oakland Street, should look at this. So from the existing driveway, the garage would go into the basement from this corner around to this corner, and works its way up is the basement is exposed, the full level. So it is over 50% of the linear feet of the footprint of the existing house, more than the one half.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christian Klein - 150</summary>

> Is that Mr Rickardelli I've I'm sorry I've, I've turned off looking at my looking at my hard drive and I can't see who spoke. Mr. Blank. I think the one drawing that they submitted that helps helped me was the updated site plan, because it did show the existing average grade, and then also gives dimension for the basement ceiling height. And when you do the math with those you get a number greater than four foot six. That helped me understand the basement county as a story. Okay, I'm just, I'm going to pause here and just and let others begin asking questions if you could I've stepped away so that I can't see my screen so if you when you asked to be to speak if you can just say who you are. Is there anybody else who wants to ask questions or comments on the application.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr Rickardelli - 237</summary>

> Mr. It's Mr. Mr Rickardelli. I, you know, I think our understanding, the last, I'm just, you know, driving up my memory from the last hearing figure understanding from the last hearing was that we had a condition where this basement was mostly covered. And then we were adding this. The proposal was to add this addition to the basement level, which would make it mostly not covered. And that was the crux of going from two to three stories, it seems like what has been argued, and I think makes sense is that that was never really the case it was always three stories. And as the architect just mentioned, half of the foundation is already exposed that would be counted as a basement not a cellar by the, by the building code, which would mean it was a story and I think that that that logic And I think, you know, in the, in terms of the large addition criteria, I wouldn't have any concerns about the appropriateness of of what's being proposed, just by two cents. So I, I Mr. And I see I think that I probably have just done it again and interrupted you in the middle of your presentation and I maybe I should give it back to you and give you a fair chance to say what you wanted to say. Well, I, I was going to be arguing variance
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 106</summary>

> Okay, even though I, I knew that I'd have a problem with it. I was going to be arguing that. And once I got the sense that my concern as corroborated by yourself and others that that was not going to fly. You've got to understand that there historically there have been different makeups on the zoning Board of Appeals in Arlington. 20 years ago, the variance that I would have been applying for and requesting would have been allowed. Okay. By the, by the zoning board. on the board, but I concede that they were not applying the law as the law should be applied.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 412</summary>

> Okay. There was a different perspective, emanating from the, the board, more from the point of view of trying to make folks comfortable in their homes and keep folks in their homes, so they don't wind up selling and by the way, my clients have two young children. And that's the reason why they want this additional space. to remain here. They've been here for years. All their neighbors love them. If you've read the emails, any, any five or 10 of the emails I've sent all their neighbors love them, and nobody registered any disdain or any non support for what they're proposing. So the question in my mind, as their attorney at this point, particularly after listening to what you had to say Mr Hanlon last time is what can I do to try to give these folks, the additional space they need so that they can have the space for their have an area for the children to play. So that everybody's not falling over each other and give them additional living space, so they can stay in town. And the, to my mind, when the 48 Oakland and case was proposed. suggested that I read it. I was kind of encouraged when I read that case. And I use the word dicta d ICT a for non lawyers, you may not know what that means but all of the language in 48 Oakland have, even though it was a conforming situation under paragraph, a, all of that language that ensued after that, such as the property with design standards are one zone, not dissimilar to other properties and not having an adverse effect on surrounding the surrounding neighborhood. All of those facts were not dicta. They were germane to that decision, because that decision was decided using sub paragraph B. And so I'm here, trying to bring about a situation where my class can get relief under sub paragraph be arguing that the, the, yes, they have a non conformity, but the non conformity has existed since 1939. And when they bought the house. Nobody told them that well you you got three stories here you got a problem. And, well, they're actually kind of lucky they have that problem now. Yes, yes, because they have the special position that the law gives to prior non conforming uses and that puts them in a better position than if they were conforming so it's so it's a lucky thing.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 138</summary>

> Yes. So I agree with that. And so that's why I'm here. And I think that's basically what I was going to say. Before you put me on the other path that Mr. So let me see if there's nothing else for that the board wants to explore it right now, this is a public hearing and, and would be helpful to give the public a chance to, to speak on the application. I'm not quite sure who there is, who wants to address this but the general rules for the conduct of a public hearing were read by Mr. Klein. They haven't changed. And so, is there anyone here who wishes to address this application. I don't see anyone going once going twice. Going three times. Okay. So are there any questions and comments from the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 472</summary>

> Okay, this is a relative. In some ways, this is going to turn out to be a relatively straightforward case although it's route to us hasn't been very straightforward at all. The legal background is if we define if we find, and it seems that this is that the existing houses three stories, then this is the extension of a non conforming use, if it is the extension of a non conforming use it's governed by section 8.1 3B of the zoning bylaw, and the standard where to apply is whether or not the extension is more detrimental to the neighborhood, then the current nonconformity. We typically do that by looking at the special permit criteria of section 3.3. Here we have the additional complication that this is probably also a large addition. Section 3.2 requires us to look at the requirements of section 3.3, but to be paying a special attention to setbacks and the proximity of structures and uses to other structure budding structures and uses. At this point, we've had a chance to look at where this is we do know that this has been built by is being built behind the structure and away from the street we saw from the diagrams that were presented to us last time the elevations that the building looks more or less like a two story building from the street, even though from the back, it looks. It looks more like a three story building. We also know that there's about 50 to 60 feet of rear setback left and then a substantial distance between the property line and the building to the back so that we're not dealing with the kind of proximity to a neighboring property that sometimes becomes important in large in large additions. What we've noticed is that many other houses in this area have had similar additions over the years and that in the end. This will look a great deal like its neighbors and will be for that reason also consistent with the, with the prevailing pattern of the neighborhood. We also had a certain had a considerable number of people including the butter to immediately to the right, if I'm, if I got my hands correct, that have supported the application and we haven't heard any. And we have haven't heard any opposition. Saying, if all of those reporters willing to find all of those things it sounds feels to me as if this is an appropriate case for an approval but you all are entitled to your own opinion. Is there anyone else would like to address this case. All right, seeing none. If we, if the board is inclined to approve the approve the opinion, the case, it would want to impose the three standard conditions that we read into the record before.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 23</summary>

> Are there any additional conditions that the board considers appropriate in this case. All right, saying none. The chair will accept a motion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Dupont - 243</summary>

> Mr Chairman, Mr DuPont. So this is going to be a little bit awkward because I think I may be adding in something that's more along the lines of findings, but, and then we can sort of go to the language of the motion itself. My understanding is that, first of all, we are accepting for the record that this is a three family structure, three story structure the existing structure. And that as a result of that, that we are going to apply. Section 8.1 point three be as an extension of a non conforming structure. And so that we need to therefore make the requisite finding that it is not more detrimental the extension itself is not more detrimental to the neighborhood. In addition, we are also finding that this is a large addition as defined by 5.2. I'm sorry 5.4 point two B six. And that since it is greater than 750 square feet, and it's not entirely within the foundation that we are also going to make the finding that it meets the criteria set forth in section B six with regard to harmony with the neighborhood and all of that. So, I don't know where that goes, but I think the motion I, I would move that the application of the owners of 14 Oakland Avenue be approved. Under both 8.1 point three. The, as well as 5.4 point to the sex, subject to the three standard conditions.

And the chair votes, I have I left somebody out again. I don't think I have this time. Right, so the, the motion carries and be for sure we'll be making the, the findings that that Mr DuPont indicated and that I was trying to describe a basis for. All right, Mr NSC you've, you've done good work for your clients and it's tight. Service by pointing me in the correct direction, Mr. Welcome.

<details><summary>Future Meetings and Adjournment</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 840</summary>

> At this point, I'd like to remind the board. Of our upcoming. Meeting. We have, as you know, the special. And I'm going to have to do this by memory because I've now lost the sheet that. That Christian gave me that tells. Tells me when everything is. So on April, on August 1st, we will be dealing with the comprehensive permit in the 10 sunny side case. That will be. And. The next meeting after that will be primarily focused on. On the. On a draft decision by Mr. Haverty. Where we'll be paying attention to the language of conditions and so forth. And we're going to do that. On August 15th. At which point we have 40 days, which takes us to approximately September 20th to actually decide the case. And we're going to do. Exactly what every sensible person would do. And faced with a daunting deadline like that. We're going to take a two week vacation from this case. And. And think about it. And then we're going to have a regular hearing scheduled for the 12th. And we have roughly three cases currently scheduled for that. For that evening. And then when we get into September, we have a regular hearing scheduled for the 12th. We do not at this point have the deliberations sessions for 10 sunny side scheduled yet. But as you can tell from my just indicating when the 40 days are up, we're going to have a regular hearing scheduled for the 12th. And then we have. The sixth, which is, I believe it's the sixth. The Tuesday immediately after Labor day. And then there's a. Tuesday. That's two weeks after that, that I think that we have no regular hearing on. That we may need. We, we don't really know how long it will take. I would say that. If we were to decide. To do the deliberations. I would say that. It shouldn't take more than one day, but on the other hand, If even if it took only two days, it would be a record for us. And so we probably need to reserve at least two days to make sure that we get to the case decided within the time limit. That's appropriate. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe the fifth, but. Whatever that Tuesday is in the fire and the Tuesday, two weeks later would be the dates that we probably should be looking at for. To finish our work on, on 10 sunny side. All right. Thank you very much. It's been a pleasure being with you all tonight. And. And. Thank you. Thank you. On the other hand, there were some interesting wrinkles in both of these cases. So we'll see you again on the first. Again, you may want to look at your notes and anything that, that you sort of once thought, and that hasn't to your satisfaction been addressed. You may want to see. You may want to be willing to. Are interested in raising them. So. I have a copy of Tetra techs. Papers that produces a large number of comments, some of which. We have, we, the applicant will be addressing orally. They will also be submitting a paper that will do with that. We'll address all of these things. And. So. That will be a focus of the hearing, but. This is our last chance really. This is our last chance to hear. The last chance to hear. To just to go sort of free for all and make sure that we've, that we don't have any things that when we get to deliberation, we wish we'd brought up and then we forgot. So with all that, that gives us another week to really enjoy ourselves. Going up to our elbows in the minutia of 10 Sunnyside Avenue. Thank you. Thank you. August 8th. That is not the case. I must have that long. I do not believe there's a meeting on the eighth. No. Okay. I probably have that one. Oh, also. Well, I have the floor. I would like to get in touch with you about that first case tonight, about what you had to say and what I was saying. But that's not nothing to do with the official record. Feel free. I'm sorry. Right. Thank you. Thank you. So there's more of the chair will indicate it will accept a motion to adjourn. So move Mr. Chairman. Moved by Mr. DuPont. Seconded by Mr. Moore. Not really somebody else has to do the second. Mr. Holy. Go through the role, Mr. Rickardelli. Mr. Mr. DuPont. Mr. Holy. Aye. And the chair votes. Aye. The motion succeeds. I will say that it would have been more. Aesthetic is if each of you, when you voted, I had just exited then. So that we would then have something that looks like in an old time movie when you get to the last thing. All right. Good night, everybody. Good night. Good night.
