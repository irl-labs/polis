<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is 7.35pm. It is Tuesday, December 12, 2023. Good evening. My name is Christian Klein. I'm the chair of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals, and I'm calling this meeting of the board to order. I'd like to confirm all members and anticipated officials are present. From the Zoning Board of Appeals, Roger Dupont? Here. Patrick Hanlon? Here. Venkat Hali? Here. Dan Riccardelli? Here. Adam LeBlanc? Here. And Ms. Hoffman is not with us this evening. And here from the town, we have Colleen Ralston, our zoning assistant. Here. Good to have you with us. This open meeting of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals is being conducted remotely, consistent with an act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2023 to provide for supplementing certain existing appropriations and for certain other activities and projects signed into law March 29, 2023. This act includes an extension until March 31st, 2025. The remote meeting provisions of Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 executive order suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, which suspended the requirement to hold all meetings in a publicly accessible physical location. Public bodies may continue to hold meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present in a meeting location, so long as they provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings. Public bodies may meet remotely so long as reasonable public access is afforded so the public can follow along with the deliberations of the meeting and an opportunity for public participation will be provided during public comment period during each public hearing. For this meeting, the Zoning Board of Appeals has convened a video conference via the Zoom application with online telephone access is listed on the agenda posted to the town's website identifying how the public may join. This meeting is being recorded and will be broadcast by ACMI. Please be aware that attendees are participating by a variety of means. Some attendees are participating by video conference. Others are participating by computer audio or by telephone. Accordingly, please be aware that other folks may be able to see you, your screen name, or another identifier. Please take care to not share personal information. Anything you broadcast may be captured by the recording. We ask that you please maintain decorum during the meeting, including displaying an appropriate background. All supporting materials that have been provided members of this body are available on the town's website and as otherwise noted, the public is encouraged to follow along using the posted agenda. As chair, I reserve the right to take items out of order in the interest of promoting orderly meetings. This meeting, we have no hearings on the agenda. We just have administrative items. So these items relate to the operation of the board and as such will generally be conducted without input from the general public. The board will not take up any new business on prior hearings, nor will there be the introduction of any new information on matters previously brought before the board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. The minutes indicate that I was present at that meeting, which is true, but I was only present from the Mystic Lakes case on, and since I otherwise would have recused myself from the appeal in 106 Mount Vernon Street, I would appreciate it if there could be a note on the attendance list that I joined the meeting as of the 5 Mystic Lakes Drive case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Dupont. I would just request that if there is a significant change for Pleasant Street, the sooner we know the better because I was actually going to go back and listen to old meetings. A couple of things and I just wanted to make sure that I don't do that. If it's not going anywhere.</blockquote>
