> So, I'd like the first item on our agenda is, is an administrative item. And that is the hearing in his approval of the decision in 20 Martin Street. You've received that decision on in draft on Monday, and I made with all the changes that were recommended where, in this case, we're just updating the header and the name of the file and redistributed that this afternoon. And so, this is an administrative matter that will not have a public comment period and we will not be discussing the merits of all of that. The question, the decision haven't been taken on May 23. So, the, is there any further for any firm is condition comments or additions to, to the, the, to the proposed decision that you've received today. Yeah. Okay, seeing none, the chair will entertain a motion to approve the decision.

<details><summary>60 High Haith Road - Docket #3748</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 59</summary>

> Okay, so we're ready to get into the, the public hearings. And the first public hearing is on our list is 60 high Heath Road. And we see. The Mr Nielsen. Okay. So, Mr Nielsen, are you going to make the presentation or. Did you have somebody else who was going to do it to do it for you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Nielsen - 17</summary>

> I'm going to start and I'm going to turn it over to the architect, Chris Berry. Okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 14</summary>

> So why don't you tell us what you. What you're proposing to do. Okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Nielsen - 612</summary>

> So, as I mentioned, I'm Chris. This is Emily and Chris Barry's architect. Okay. And I know these initial statements should probably be pretty concise for your sake. So. I'm just going to say a couple of quick things. Number one, that Emily and I are longtime Arlingtonians. Having lived four blocks away from this house on, on Highland Avenue for 20 years in Emily's case, 15 years in my case. And when we saw that a tiny house. That adjoins a monotony rocks park. Came on the market. We suddenly started thinking this would be a very cool place for us to sort of develop and live in for the rest of our lives. So. So we, we jumped on this house and, and we purchased it. Despite the fact that it is very tiny. And it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not a living room inside. It's not really livable as it is. So then we, we set about designing a renovation of the existing house and an addition. For these purposes, big enough for us to kind of host family when they visit. We also Emily works at home now. And I sometimes work at home. And so we, we have a lot of time to get together and come up with ideas. And so that's kind of where we sort of came up with the idea. And that's kind of what we've built it in, in, in, in the current planned house that we. Submitted for the special permit. We talked to the. The building inspector, Mike. Even before we bought the house several times subsequently. And then we had like an hour and a half long conversation with him a few months ago. And he said, you know, we're going to have a special permit for this house. And so that's kind of what we came up with. And then the other thing we really needed to apply for was a special permit. On the basis of a, an addition to the house that was larger than 750 square feet. So that's what we. Are. Presenting today. The, the other thing that I want to mention, the only other thing I want to mention, I don't know if I mentioned this before, but I think it would be of interest to the committee members. No matter what, or the board members. And that's it. Emily and I both work in climate. Climate change mitigation fields. And so as we were undertaking this project, We decided that we. We needed to try and try to come up with a plan for this house that would be. That would be. That would be. That would be. That would be a plan for decarbonization. And so I just want to mention that we. We. Hired a energy consultant to help us and Chris or architect, think about how to design this house. We learned a lot about that and we. We're very kind of pleased that where we got, we got a lot of good feedback. We got a lot of good feedback. We got a lot of good feedback. On how to design a, a, a relatively low cost supplier of triple pane passive certified windows and a hundred percent electrification and solar power on the roof. Our, our consultant, John Rottenheiser. Who is a hers Raider has advised us that the projected hers rating for this house is. A hundred percent electrification. So we want to make sure that you. At least we're aware of that aspect of our plans here. So I'm going to turn it over to. Chris Berry. Our architect.

<details><summary>	 Chris Berry - 927</summary>

> Great. Thank you. It's nice to be here this evening. I've been working with Chris and Emily for about three years now. And we've been working on this project for a number of years. We understand by definition. This has been classified as a large addition. But in relation to the actual surrounding houses, the net result of this project is consistent with other homes in the city. And we're very, very pleased with the outcome of this project. We have a modest home that addresses both their needs and reinforces the natural features of this site, which we find to be quite dynamic. It was one of the reasons why they decided to buy the house. The ideas such as like a garage, And a garage that's a little bit more accessible than the original house. So that's one of the reasons why they decided to buy the house. And then we're very pleased with the outcome of this project. We want to bring the nature down, but that also is not consistent with the ideas that we believe in in terms of green and sustainable environments. And we wanted to carry the character of the original house onto the, the addition. So. The addition is. It's lower. So. Very good. Let me interrupt for a second, but if you'd like to. Either share your screen or have us do it. It may be helpful for you to refer to the plants. It's up to you. Sure. Sure. Share screen. Sorry, Mr. Austin. We can see, we can set that up. Screen. No, I did it when he first came on. He's awesome. I think I can do it. I just had to choose which screen. Share. I believe I am sharing a screen that looks like. Okay. Let's go away. We can use the rendering while I load something else. If you would like drawings. This is the rendering of the front side of the house. To the. Right here. We're just seeing your Chrome window. Okay. You see drawings now. No, we don't. No. Okay. Stop share. We'll try that again. Screen share. Sure. Do you send your lines now? Yep. We do. Oh, very good. Sorry about that. Okay. So. To put you in these drawings. The existing houses, this square. Including the porch. Which was. And our addition is this piece here. They're linked together by the kitchen dining room space. The kitchen dining room. Is a very modest size house. Here's the existing house. On the right. The addition here on the left. This faces high Hayth road. In the rear of the building, which faces the park. The existing house is now on the left and the addition is on the right. And the addition is here on the left. The other end elevation, which is essentially the existing house because we're not adding anything on that side of the house. And if you want, I can do the rendering. That's the front side of the house. And again, the existing houses on the right. The existing porch and the addition is here on the left. Notice that the house is set back. The addition is set back from the existing on the front in the rendering. It's also set back in the back as well. When you see the drawings. Yeah. We're set back in away from the existing property line or the existing. Building line in the back and the front. And again, I just reinforce. That we're not adding anything on that side of the house. And I just want to mention what we, what we discussed with the building inspector is that. It's our understanding that we're here for the large edition classification and that we are essentially in compliance with the other aspects of the zoning code. And from there, we'd like you to possibly comment. Okay. So you're proposing to leave it at zero parking where. Yes. Where do you expect the parking actually to take place at this? For that. There is no parking for this house right now, except that this is relatively a dead end street. The street did not continue through because of some site grading issues. There's rock outcroppings and things of that nature. So it's not a dead end street. It's a driveway. And so. So if we take a picture of the existing. The parking is here, which is essentially a dead end. It almost appears it's a driveway for the house, although technically it is city land. I see. So it's the area that sort of looks like a parking space is actually on what would have been the right of way. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So. I'm not sure. I had a sense that there were some plans for a gas line to be brought in. And wondered how that was consistent with the idea. This was going to be all electric. Or did I, am I mistaken about that? No plans for a gas line. There is a wood stove. Identified in the house. But no gas at all. There is. There is a gas line, but we're going to remove it. So the heating, heating, air conditioning. And I noticed how water we're all going to be produced by heat pump technology really basically. Right. Yes. And you're going to have a high performance building envelope in order to. If not be passive house, at least. At least make it a highly efficient. Highly efficient building. Yes, we have a. High performance building.

<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 16</summary>

> Is there any to do any members of the board have any questions or comments? Mr.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. ? - 48</summary>

> I was just wondering if the applicant can just explain. The grading a little bit. It looks like it drops off. A good amount in the back. And maybe that, that basement as a walkout. Is there any additional wall that is needed as part of the construction?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Berry - 85</summary>

> Sure. Essentially the, our addition is theretaining. The you're right. There is a depression to the side of thehouse and the addition is sitting in that sort of likely depressionarea. And then the foundation wall. So there's no retaining wall inthe end. Result. We returned to existing natural grade at the back. Wemodify the grades in the front slightly too. Basically essentiallybackfill the foundation. Which then gives us a relatively levellawn. And so then that, that front foundation wall. Is that whatyou're saying? Yes. Yes.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Public Comments</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 212</summary>

> Thank you. Any other questions? Okay. Seeing not this. This is a public hearing. Okay. Public questions and comments will only be taken as they relate to the matter at hand and should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing their decision. Members of the public will be granted time to ask questions and make comments. Members of the public who wish to speak should digitally raise their hands using the button on the participants tab in the zoom application. And you'll be asked to give your name and address. And you will be given time for your questions and comments. All questions are to be addressed through the chair. And please remember to speak clearly. Once all public. Questions and comments have been addressed. Where the. Allocated time has ended. The public comment period will be closed. And we'll move on to public comment. The application. Here. It's now about five minutes to eight. And I would propose going to about a quarter after 20, after if the people, if there's enough interest in doing that. And so then we'll, and then we'll see where we go from there. The first person I have on. Okay. So you introduce yourself. Say your name and address for the record.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Daniel Sheehan - 186</summary>

> Sure. My name is Daniel Sheehan and I live at 22 Longfellow road around the corner from this home. And. Go ahead. Just go ahead. Okay. So I just. Thank you. Hi, I'm Daniel Sheehan. I'm a resident of Longfellow street to the neighborhood. And I look forward to hopefully seeing this all fulfilled. The questions that I had. And I want to have a comment also, as part of that question is. What, what will happen with parking now? The, the, the, the past history of this lot. Is that the, the, the prior owners parked on the street. It seemed to me. That it was their property. And it was not usable. As a street. I think as the architect, Mr. Berry said. There's a trail that goes up a Hill. You know, there were topographic reasons why they didn't continue the street and they didn't continue the street. Is there possibilities of granting some kind of parking to this? And that would be. Again, I think it'd be lovely for the neighborhood if that were possible. And that's all I have to say.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 146</summary>

> I think that's a decision for the town to make. I mean, it certainly would be lovely if they town made a, an official arrangement. The road might need a bit of repair. The owners might be willing to consider some kind of. Compensation if, if they can have an agreement to have some parking designated to them. Yeah. I think it's really what, what can the town potentially offer? What do they think they could do? So the issue is that the, the area that we've been thinking about is the parking area that has been historically the parking area is not the applicant's property. It's the property of the town. Is that right?  That's what we believe. The surveys. It's certainly not on the survey. Whoever, whoever belongs to, it's not you. It's not the applicant's property. It's the property of the town.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Nielson - 78</summary>

> I just want to say, this is Chris, the owner. Yeah, that's, that's our understanding. And as. It just needs to be clear for people who can't. See this site that it really is a dead end. It's just the dead end of the street. And so essentially we're parking in the dead end of the street. If there could be a special arrangement with the town. So that sort of. Formalize that would be great. Yeah. Yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Daniel Sheehan - 142</summary>

> This is the. Hey, Mr. Shane, do you have some more, anything else? I just want to say that in terms of the parking, I, you know, I concur that that is. That is not a useful part of the street. I think the town. If it's through the zoning board of appeals or whoever would be done that, that is. That is not a useful part of the street. I mean, it doesn't serve a purpose. It doesn't serve a public purpose that I'm aware of. Thank you. Thank you. I didn't, by saying thank you. I didn't mean to cut you off. If you had something else you wanted to say, you're free to say it. No, no, I I'm I'm also. That's that's the comments that I have. I appreciate it. The chance to speak. Thank you very much.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 14</summary>

> Mr. Shan. Thank you. Okay. The next person on my list is Mr. Latona.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Liz Latona - 144</summary>

> Hi, this is actually Liz because Eli is driving. Okay. We live at 64 high hate. So the house that's right next to 60. Hi. And are primarily calling in because we just wanted to just give our understanding of what's going on right now. And we're very pleased to see that house turn into something lovely. Alongside others. As they kind of walked us through everything that was going to happen. And we're very pleased to see that house turn into something lovely rather than the sort of. I guess dump that it is now because that's what it is. Sorry guys. And then I'll just want a second that, that ending that they're talking about is literally a dead end and nobody uses it. And so I would also be firmly behind that turning into something that is. That's what it is.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 23</summary>

> Excellent. Thank you very much. The next person on our list is Steve Moore, whom we've seen once or twice in the past.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 22</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Steve Moore, Piedmont street. My firstquestion to the applicant through you would be, is this a public orprivate way?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Berry - 22</summary>

> You want to come in on that? I'm not familiar,but maybe the owner knows. I assume it's just, it's a public citystreet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Nielson and Steve Moore and Patrick Hanlon - 955</summary>

> Well, it just, just for information for the town of Arlington, there's two types of streets, public ways, which are town maintained and town owned private ways, which are not town maintained and actually a butter owned. It's complicated, but there are private ways in the town of Arlington. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not familiar with the town of Arlington. I wonder which this was. Chris Nielsen. Do you have a. We don't know. We've assumed that it's a public way, but we don't actually know. You asked is high hate the public way. I mean, pie hate is a public way. It's a, it's a road. Are you talking, you're talking about the. Connection between the, between the two segments of. The city of Arlington. I don't know if I can intervene. I hear just a second. The roads like Massachusetts Avenue are owned by the public there by some, by one government organization or another, I picked a bad example because that's not the town really, but. Those are dedicated to public use. They're owned by the public. They're maintained by the public. They're owned by the public. They're owned by the public. And they're owned by the public. So the roads have not been dedicated to public development. Developments and so forth. The roads have not been dedicated to public use. And the people who live along the road. Are the ones who are responsive, who own it and who are responsible for. Maintaining it. And who are responsible for regulating who parks on it and drives on it. And so, you know, I don't know if there's been an agreement made with the city of Arlington. Or whether an agreement has been made with the town for public maintenance, but that is a procedure that's done by the select board. And I think what Mr. Moore is driving at is which kind of road this is because. An applicant or a. I don't know. I don't know if there's been an agreement made with the city of Arlington. To decide upon whether or not the butter is. Abutting a public street or whether he's a bubbly. Abutting a private street, even though the private street may be dedicated to public use. The way. Private streets often are Mr. Moore. Do I have that right? Yes. Yes, Mr. Thank you. Thank you so much. That's. That's completely the case. Yes. Yes. The reason being that this question is about parking on the street. If it's a private way, this would not be an issue. If it's a public way, it's a public street in the town. Keeps the public ways clear and parking probably is not an arrangement. The town would make, even if it's a dead end and of no use. For moreover, if this is a paper, If this is a paper street, If this is a paper street, If this is a paper street, If this is a paper street, If this is a paper street, If this is a paper street, Butters cannot develop property or develop that section. Now this, this particular butter is not. Asking to do that. So that's a non-issue, but there may be a paper street. It continues. Even though the grade would not allow the street to proceed. Anyway, I've just, the reason I brought up the question to do with that was because of the parking issue in the town. I'm not sure if the board would approve the project. Without community parking. I would be surprised if the board would approve the project without. Parking on the site. We're doing a large addition here and it would make sense to add parking to the site since. Generally parking is, is something which. Properties do have. Depending on street parking is not. I don't see any trees on the property. The question is to do with the trees that are on the property. The where it's going to be developed. Are there significant trees that look like from the aerial maps? There was some significant tree cover or trees to be taken. I didn't see any. Trees on, on any of the. The property maps. And I also don't see a tree plan. Which should be required for this development. Okay. So. There's. A lot of trees on the surrounding properties. There's a lot of trees in the park. Right against the house. On the property itself. There are a couple of small. Trees like there's a dogwood. I don't think any of them are, have a high, a greater diameter than six inches. So. For this project, we would, we'd be removing a lot of the shrubbery. We don't know yet about the specific. Trees. I think there's only two of them. And, but we might, we, it's possible. We might have to remove one of those trees. But they're both less than six inches in diameter. The trees that we'd be removing. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. If you look at Google maps or something. There's a lot of trees around this, but all those trees are. Are it's canopy from bigger trees. On the adjoining properties and from the park. Mr. That is pretty hard to tell from the aerial vet. That's good news. Certainly if they're six inches or less. They're not, they're not covered by the tree bylaw. So that's, that's a, that's good news, but I believe you still will have to do a tree plan. Because this is. Additional larger than 750 square feet. That has to be approved by the warden and done by a certified or. Just information for the client. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Nielson - 108</summary>

> Yeah. Can I just. Say one thing. Thank you. Thank you very much. We appreciate the. Thank you.  I did talk to a, a town arborist. I didn't talk to the tree warden. I talked to a town arborist. Early when we brought this property and he kind of assessed the different trees. And so some, some of what I've described to you is based on what he told me. And then I also had a commercial arborist come by and he basically assessed the trees. And he said, okay, we're going to have to do a tree plan. So that's what we're going to do. Yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 15</summary>

> Excellent. Thankyou. Thank you. The next person on our list is Nora. Not been. Notmen.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Nora Not Men - 364</summary>

> Hi. Can you hear me? I can. I am. I also am a resident ofLongfellow road. I live a few houses up the street. I'm seeing theplans for the first time today, because I didn't make it over onSaturday. I'm a certified architect. And. I want to also fully supportthe project. I think they've done a great job with the proposedaddition. And I'm really familiar with the site as I walked by it, atleast once a day walking my dog. So I think it's a great idea. And I'dalso like to speak to the issue of parking. I don't know if I'm ableto share. My screen, maybe not, but I'm looking right now atthe. Satellite view and the town improvements. I do believe I hatethis is a public way, but the town improvements that have been made tohigh hate. Stop before this property. I do believe that there's a lotof asphalt and pavement. That's sort of at the end of the dry at the,of the dead end. So I do think that should be examined as to whetherit can be, there's a way to formalize off street parking for thesite. Which I think would be, it would be useful to have itbe. Defined formally and not be a kind of. Random and informalprocess. And I do also applaud sort of asking for the tree planbecause I think it's always good to do that. When there's a largerproject, just to keep track of all of these things because there'sbeen some pretty. Egregious additions in the neighborhood with a lotof. Removal of trees. And in this case, I agree that there aren'tmajor trees on the site. So. The tree plan shouldn't be any kind ofa. A barrier to the project going forward, but I think it's alwaysgood to have that information. In the towns records as it's supposedto be. But. I do think this is a really, really well. Defined andorganized project and it will add to the quality of the streetand. And. Probably also just generally help withthe. Sometimes. Difficult drainage situations in that area. Whenthere's a big storm. So. I think it's. Great job, you guys. And I lookforward to seeing it get built.

> Okay. Thank you. The next speaker is Jane. And if she's a French extraction, it may be OJ or German, maybe Auger, or it could be anything else too. Jane, if you could. If you could correct my pronunciation, I'd appreciate it and stay your dress for the record.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane OJ - 222</summary>

> Yes, it's a. It's OJ. You're the only person who's ever said it correctly on first notice. So thank you. Okay. So I'm going to show you a little bit of the road. The high Heath path. Which is, you know, between our houses between upper and lower high Heath and Ottawa. So I can see Chris's house from my window. I also like the plan very much. of the tree canopy as possible. I can speak to the fact that it is a public road. And the town, when they plow, stops a little bit short of where you would park at 60 High Haith on that little strip of asphalt. And that's directly adjacent to the entrance that everyone uses to go up the High Haith path. So while it is a public road maintained by Arlington, that little orphan asphalt that Laura spoke about is where 60 High Haith people have always parked in the 25 years that I've been here. So, and the town engineer told me that the path itself, the paper street is owned by the Abutters, which surprised me. And he said that the town allows the 60 High Haith residents to park on that little strip of asphalt. So that's just a little historical note from the past. And welcome to Chris and Emily.

> Thank you very much, Ms. O'Shea. Ms. Snowman, your hand is up. I'm not sure whether you had something else you would want to add or whether you had just left it up. No, I'm sorry, I'll take it down. Okay, thank you. The next speaker I have on our list is Elizabeth Rollins.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Rollins - 145</summary>

> Hi, Elizabeth Rollins. I'm 47 Ottawa, but I'mactually Chris and Emily's exact next door neighbor up the hill, eventhough it's a different street. I just wanted to say, I'm excited tosee the house grow and change. I think most of the trees that peopleare probably talking about are on my property. And I've already had agood conversation with Chris about that, about maintaining those treesduring this process. And so we'll keep up that conversation and alsoagreeing with Jane, who I've lived next door to for 15 years anddidn't know how to pronounce her name. People have been parking cars,boats, and RVs on the end of that street for the 15 years that I'velived here and it's never been an issue. So there's definitely someprecedent for just what has always happened and has always beenaccepted and okay. Anyway, welcome Chris and Emily. We're glad to haveyou.

> Thank you, Ms. Rollins. Is there anybody else who wishes to address this application? All right, seeing none, we'll now close the public comment period for this meeting. And the board can discuss their findings and a potential decision. The vote taken at this hearing will be preliminary until a decision is approved by the board at a subsequent meeting. And all votes will be conducted by a roll call vote. Those of you who are here from the beginning were witness to the process of the final approval of a decision at the next meeting after a written decision is prepared. So just to provide a summary to begin with, this is a case that is seeking a special permit for a large addition. The standards for that are set forth in the bylaw. Partly they are compliance with all of the provisions of section 3.3 that we normally apply for specials permits, but we're particularly directed to look at the impacts on people who are abutters and people who are very near to the proposed project because as the case of this case, the proposal would otherwise comply with the bylaw and be doable by right, but for the fact that it is a large addition and subject to a more detailed look. I'm not going to go through all of the different provisions in section 3.3. We've had a good deal of discussion, a large number of the abutters who generally welcome this project and are implicitly suggesting to us that it's consistent with the neighborhood. Certainly there's a considerable public benefit, which I think that the board has in the past and should take into consideration in that it's highly energy efficient and if not net zero, at least something that is very much aligned with the town's goals. One of the areas, two areas that have had a lot of attention, one of which has to do with parking. Right now, there are zero parking spaces on site and as far as the record shows, there has never been parking that is actually on site. The zoning bylaw requires one parking space, but this is on the basis of the record before us, it is a prior nonconforming use and the board and no new nonconformity is being issued and it is not being exacerbated in any way or at least it doesn't appear to me that it is. With respect to trees, it is not unlikely that there's not very much on the property that would raise a concern, but if it's the board's intention to approve this project, it may well be useful for us to include a condition that would require the preparation of a tree plan and consultation, formal consultation with the tree warden before clearing anything more from the site. That said, that's subject to your differing on every single point, but that sort of is a framework to get started. Is there anyone who wishes to, any members of the board who wish to address this application?

<details><summary>	 Mr. Holy - 163</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Holy. I had a question, if I may. I was looking at the table that was filled up as a part of the application. It says a number of stories, the building height is still two, but this is a walkout basement. And with the new addition, we would want to know the impact on the overall building height. Would the basement be still considered a half story or a full story? And there's no average grade shown, so it's hard to say whether it is under 35 feet, which I assume it is, but it is not shown currently. So I'd like to understand, was the walkout part always there as a first question? And because of this new addition, has there been any change to establish if the basement is now considered a story because the height seems to be below four feet, six inches. The ceiling of the basement seems to be above four feet, six inches.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Berry - 285</summary>

> Yes, should I take that one? Yes, Mr. Berry. Existing basement is not quite a walkout. It actually requires you to step up in order to get out. And we have done the calculation for the qualifications to be considered a story. And we don't meet the qualification as a story. We're under that requirement. So we see this as a two-story house. So if Mr. Holy, am I right in recalling that the requirement is the ceiling being above four feet, six inches above the average building height? Is that what the requirement is? I don't have the zoning ordinance behind me. Yeah, a basement should be deemed a story when its ceiling is four feet, six inches or more above the finished grade. And because there was no finished grade, I was unsure of if it met or not. Zoning, are you referring to? It's under the definitions. Yeah, that's the definition. Yeah, we were using that. We were looking at it. Yeah. Sorry, I'm scrolling for this. We're using the- I think it's the definition of a story, isn't it? It's on page 26. There's also a whole diagram of how it's calculated. We did the calculation, yes. Yeah, it's in the first part, the illustration. It's 222. Is it page 22, Chris? Well, it was 2-22. That would be in the definition part. There we go, yeah. We were using this, and we're safe on both of these categories. Actually, the diagram is quite similar to our situation. This would be the front at high hay. This would be in the back. The floor is lower than the grade. And when you do these calculations, our numbers are below the requirements.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 27</summary>

> Yeah. Mr. Berry, has this been a discussion between you or the applicant and ISD? Have they ever suggested that the basement should count as a story?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Berry - 330</summary>

> I believe Chris has had some conversations with the building inspector. I've not specifically had any conversation with him regarding this. No one's proposed it as being a story. Mr. Nielsen, I wonder if that subject has come up with ISD. You're talking about the building inspector? No, I don't think they've come up with the building inspector. So the building inspector has not brought this up with you in any event, right? No. And he has reviewed the drawings as part of getting to this point and helping us understand the zoning requirements. He did review the drawings and did not bring this up as an issue. Now you've done a similar calculation. I take it on the, not just the existing house, but on the house with the addition. Is that correct? Yes. And those calculations are similar to the ones that you've just described? Yeah, they're here. So the grade point at the front, the grade point at the back, the midpoint according to the diagram, and we're less than, here, I can zoom in for you. Three foot 11, and it has to be less than half of the eight foot five. And that, the halfway is the average grade, because that's the... Average grade. Because the average grade has a different definition on how that is calculated. I believe that's the average grade, yes. And similarly, the ceiling in the basement is not more than four foot six inches above the ground. Above the average grade, is that correct?  Correct. That's what we're, grade section. That's the ceiling of the space is less than four feet six above the average grade. Mr. Holy, is this satisfactory to you, or would you like to press for more information? No, it is, but this exhibit was not part of the, what was submitted. So with your chair's permission, would this be released to the board, not to review it, but as a part of the exhibits?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 131</summary>

> Yes. Mr. Berry, I wondered if you could be so kind as to submit what you've shown us today for the record as well, so that later on when somebody tries to figure out what in the world we did, they'll be able to see something that will help them get to that. Okay. And shall we submit that through, is there an email address, or how does that get submitted? You should submit that to ZBA at town, at Arlington, what is it, town.Arlington. Ms. Raulston, save me here. I'm getting all of the parts of the email address all confused. I know what it is. Okay. It's .ma.us, I think, but anyway, we know it. Oh, good. Okay, good. Thank you. Go ahead. Go ahead, no. Mr. Hawley, continue.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Holy and Patrick Hanlon - 270</summary>

> Mr. Chair, there was one other thing is that I think when the average grade is shown in this section that is on the screen, I think we should also have the same noted on all the elevations, just to be clear, because just to be clear that the average grade at the height and everything is met, all the zoning bylaws. Okay, if that can readily be done, we're probably going to act tonight, one way or the other on the application. So this is largely a matter of clarifying the record. Sure. So you have a more complicated version of these drawings, but you'd like me to add, these obviously don't show that average grade. Here would be the average grade in this particular drawing and then in this particular drawing. Yeah, if you could just. Right. Right, I don't want to impose the application to additional expense to do any more. If you could just sort of indicate the information that Mr. Hawley is talking about so that it's readily apparent in the record, because we see it now and that's what we'll act on. But the record will go into the file and later people will want to know what we see and that this will help them figure it out. Okay, okay. We'll add this to these particular drawings you see here on the screen, is that acceptable? That would be fine. You should do this in whatever way is most convenient for the applicant as long as the information is conveyed. Okay, thank you. Excellent. Okay, is there any other discussion of the application?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ms. Hoffman - 167</summary>

> Mr. Chair. Ms. Hoffman. Just a quick comment. And this is to theapplicants just because they mentioned a particular interest indecarbonization, if I may. True, please go forward. Go forward. Icertainly applaud the efforts around energy efficiency. And I justwanted to note that the other aspects of it, which you've probablybeen thinking about, because you noted the importance of saving thestructure is the embodied carbon of the material selection. So whenyou get to the time of finalizing the selections, some of the mostsignificant ones to consider are the siding, the product you choosefor the insulation and the frame material. So if you haven't alreadythought about that, that's just a little recommendation to you. Butotherwise, I applaud the application. Thank you. We actually, we doknow a little, we have learned a little bit about that and we knowthat it's a significant consideration. And yeah, we will try to keepour eye on that part too. It's a tough one actually, but to at leastreduce the embodied carbon. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 466</summary>

> Okay, so bear with me here while I re-trigger my screen so that I can see you all again. Okay. So are there any other comments or questions on the board on the application? Right, if the board is inclined to approve the application, it will of course wish to impose the standard conditions that are imposed on basically all special permit grants. And since this is the first case of the night, I can read those into the record. It will be easier if I slightly expand. The first one is the plans and specifications approved by the board for the special permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington in connection with this application for zoning relief. There shall be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington Board of Appeals. Standard condition number two is the building inspector is hereby notified that he is to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time he determines that violations are present. The building inspector shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw and under the provisions of chapter 40, section 21D of the Massachusetts general laws and institute non-criminal complaints if necessary. If necessary, the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action also in accordance with section 3.1. And standard condition number three is the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to this special permit grant. In the course of the discussion, we've also discussed having a tree plant and the chair would suggest to the board consider a fourth condition to the effect that the applicant shall prepare a tree plan and consult in consultation with the tree warden prior to the issuance of final building permits in this case. So are there any other conditions that anyone wishes to suggest? Does anyone have any questions or amendments or opposition to any of the four that I just indicated? Okay, hearing none, hearing none. Okay. Hearing none, the chair will, would accept a motion. Motion to approve the application. Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. So I would move that the application for the special permit. Under section 5.4.2 B six. Be approved. Subject to the three standard conditions, which the chair read into the record. And the additional. Condition that the applicant formulate. A tree plan and consultation with the tree warden. In advance of the issuance of the building permit. So second. Seconded by Mr. Ricardelli. Mr. DuPont. Hi. Mr. Holy. Hi. Mr. Ricardelli. Hi. Ms. Hoffman. Hi. Mr. LeBlanc. Hi. Mr. Klein is not here. Mr. Nielsen. So Mr. Nielsen, congratulations. And thank you very much for working with us tonight on the application.

<details><summary>	 Chris Nielson - 53</summary>

> Thank you. And thank all of you for your, you know, your scrutiny and your, and your, and your comments and suggestions. We really appreciate it. Good luck. Thank you so much for your help. I will stop sharing. I should say. Just encouraging you the, the. The issues with three. We did.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 192</summary>

> We're not just being negligent and not addressing the issues relating to parking. Those are matters under the discretion of the select board. And we would really have no ability to. To influence that. So, I would encourage you to contact members of the select board to discuss. What might be appropriately. Done here, given the unique history of the site. I'm sorry. That's interpreted as a. Suggestion for the. Client to approach the select board. Oh, yes. It's not a requirement. It's just that if you want to proceed along that line, we're not the body that can give you relief. They are. And under the circumstances, they may be willing to consider things that wouldn't generally be considered just because. You know, we're not the body that can give you relief. So, I would encourage you to do that. I think it's a good thing. It's a good thing in which it has. Done. And I encourage you to join with your neighbors in doing that too. It's it's, it's a thing that will affect all of you. Thank you so much. Okay. So we've done our first case tonight.

<details><summary>60-62 Magnolia Street - Docket #3753</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 19</summary>

> The second one is. 40 to 62 Magnolia street. And we'll be the primary presenter on, on this one.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Brett Character - 402</summary>

> Good evening. My name is Brett character. Character construction. And I will be point of contact, but the owners are on the phone. I believe I have David Sapp who is at 60 Magnolia and all them at 62 Magnolia. And you can address a question to them, but I believe this is a much smaller scale project than the previous one. So we. Feel free to just direct them to me. And if I need their help, I will chime in. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I just. Screen share. If needed. Hey, why don't you, you, you should. It's usually helpful, but if it. It's really up to you, what you, how you, how you want to present your. I need to be given access. Ms. Walston is does Mr. Carter have access? Okay. All right. Can everybody see that? This point. I cannot. So you cannot see anything yet. Okay. That's good. Okay. So forgive my amateur drawings in reference to. What the building typically accepts when we're building a deck of, or a porch of this nature, this is we'll pass building, which is a two story porch. That currently has a. Small roof above and access simply as an entryway alone. There's not much shared room space for two families with kids to utilize the space. It essentially just as a glorified rain cover for their mailboxes. So this would give them both private space and accessibility from their units to be able to utilize seating outside. And also would. Enhance curb appeal. Currently the neighborhood has. I believe it's like 50 or 60% of the houses have this almost exact proposal in terms of design. Double-decker porch with a second unit, having access from upstairs and the first unit having shared space down below. In conjunction with the front porch. We plan to do the. Exterior siding. So we were planning on doing the porch first, so that it was more conducive to the overall plans for the house. So the current scope. Of the front porch was important to be done first, but the siding is outdated aluminum. And while my, it might be a beautiful magenta color. It's time to update to a more. Standard siding. So in conjunction with that, this plan. That the porch was needed to be approved prior to the siding. Does anybody have any questions on that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 87</summary>

> Thank you. So is it fair to say that this porch extends across the whole facade of the house now. Sorry, my, I'm not sure if my, my. Shared screen somehow got spliced. But if you see on the left of this, so right now that's. Any comments on this? Is it, is there a question that we have?  Has anybody have any questions on that? Thank you. So is it fair to say that this porch extends across the whole facade of the house now?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Brett Character - 130</summary>

> That's. I'm sorry. My, I'm not sure if my, my. Shared screen somehow got spliced. But if you see on the left of this, I'm not sure how they got spliced together, but on the left. So on the left side of the plot plan, you can see the front porch existing. With the setbacks and you can see the basic new deck addition on the side is around 70 square feet to the lower porch. It would stay in the same setback requirements for both the driveway side. And the neighbor's side, as well as the front of house, it would just add the extra space on the bottom floor, as well as the secondary. And the second floor. Second floor. Exit for the, for the set. 62 Unit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 19</summary>

> Okay. Are there, do any of the members of the board have questions or comments? Yeah, for this time.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Mr. - 276</summary>

> I guess one question I have is maybe. Maybe for you more is I'm just curious. I'm just looking through the application. There's no like specific. Sections being sought for relief. Hoping that we just get a little clarification on that for my own. So it's my understanding that what. Is going on here. And it's based on a conversation with ISD. Is that. Is that. The. And so it's already a prior. Pre-existing non-conforming use. And what the applicant is seeking to do is to basically extend it along the same line. To cover the side of the house. Leaving aside the second story, which is a little different. And so, the applicant is looking at the existing non-conforming use. And the existing non-conforming. Porch. And looking at it from the point of view of, of an extension of a non-conforming use. So under the circumstances, The rules that will apply to this case will be the rules that are always applied to a section. Six determination, which. Or ultimately whether this is substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing non-conformity. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Please proceed. So I'm just curious what the plan is for the infill at the base of the porch. I know part of it is that existing concrete. Foundation, but the other part, that's kind of the new addition part, what that. Plan is for that. Well, it's only two holes. So both of those would be hauled off site. The infills. For the. For the infill at the base of the porch. So that's where it meets grade. You're going to put like lattice or vertical.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Brett - 60</summary>

> Oh, yeah. So, yeah. So the entire, the entire front. Part of the facade will. Will be covered in a lattice. Or design a slap design, depending on what we ended up doing, that was kind of undecided. So we would be presenting them with whatever lattice design to, to, to, to do. Okay. Yep. For kind of access, whatever.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Mr. - 45</summary>

> And then my other comment is. Is the plan also to wrap these columns and something, either be like an exact material or, or other to. To cover up that kind of maybe pressure treated that it's going to be. The example images you provide.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Brett - 86</summary>

> Yeah. So. The plans are to do a exact wrap. It could potentially change to a structural column. Similar to HB and G design, but. That the permacast concrete column as you, as you would see. But we have not yet fully disclosed on all of it. So. These are just the. You know, the framing design and how we would build the porch and then the overall finish will be wrapped in completely. With PVC or some sort of material to protect the wood long-term.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 11</summary>

> Okay. Thank you. All right. Are there any other comments? Questions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Mr. - 19</summary>

> Just, just two questions. Are the stairs being reconstructed as part of this, or is it just the porch?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Brett - 77</summary>

> It is the stairs reconstructed, but stairs are not currently. In the bylaws typically as part of the structure, they would be constructed as part of the structure. So they would be rebuilding the porch. Stairs completely. Based on the rise and run required based on the height of the new deck, which would be very similar, but their current concrete steps. So they would be demoed and built with new. Staircase with. Pressure treated lumber and.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Mr. - 50</summary>

> Okay. Yeah, no, I'm not suggesting that we're going to regulate them. I'm just. Just understanding the scope. And then for the, for the new. For the new deck, are there going to be any new gutters and downspouts or is it. How's the drainage working from the new roof?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Brett - 103</summary>

> Yeah. So we have an underlayment EPDM rubber roof liner that will cover the bottom with sleepers to keep the profile low so that the exiting of the house can be. You know, step out of the porch and then that will drain on a quarter inch pitch per foot to a gutter on the front that will then drain into the. The driveway. And then that can be removed. And then the gutter will drain. Along the opposite direction. Okay. So it'll go, it'll go on the driveway. It'll go into the, it'll go on the driveway side, but into the grass.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 276</summary>

> Got it. Great. Thank you. Any further. Okay. This is a public hearing. I read out the rules of the previous public hearing or the advice to give. They're all the same. And this one. Okay. No, seeing none. Going once. Going twice. Okay, we'll close the public hearing and turn to the board for any future comment. If we. Just to indicate to the board, I indicated. That there was a. A garden variety proposal for a. For a porch is we've seen often an effort to move the porch. That small porch that is more portico to the, to the roof. The board has generally thought of that as a favorable thing from a zoning perspective. And it's a little different because. It's really an extending a preexisting non-conforming use in terms of it's it's extension into the front yard. And also because we don't usually see porches extended in this way that cover both stories. The underlying rule is, is, is. Okay. So we have a zoning. Enabling act. Section 8.1 0.3 B of ours. Zoning bylaw. And that the zoning. That we may approve this. If we find that. The extension of the non-conformity. It does not substantially. Aggravate the adverse effect of the existing non-conformity. Okay. So I have a question. On the special exception criteria that we refer to in the last case. If it's the board's. Intention to. Approve the application. You would want to do that presumably with the three standard conditions that we've already discussed. And I wonder if anyone else, if anyone has any additional discussion. Okay. Okay. Seeing none, the chair will entertain a motion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 72</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, I was trying to get my speaker on. I did actually just for clarification. So this special permit is actually requested under 5.3 0.9. A. So for projections into the yard, I just had it up a moment ago. Okay. So you're thinking that we are granting both. The special permit for the extension. Into the minimum yard under 5.3 0.9. B. Or excuse me, is it a or B?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 273</summary>

> I think it's a. As well as the 8.1 0.3 B. Okay. Does that answer my question? Not sure that it's necessary. If, if you grant the, if. The. I believe it to be the case that if it were just done as an extension of a non-conforming use. Okay. I'm not 100% sure. I'm not 100% sure whether it all works the same. But I'm, I trust that. Permit that allows the, for the application. Okay. But I, I suppose that. And the statutory requirements are, are slightly different. So without sort of digging through the bylaw, I'm not a hundred percent sure whether it all works the same. But I'm, I trust that a permit that allows the, for the application. As the extension of a prior non-conforming use would. Would make sense. To me as well. So. So then if I may, I would. Make a motion that the application. Be approved. Under 8.1 0.3 B of the zoning bylaw. And that. The application will not be more or substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood. And that we impose the three standard conditions, which the chair. Read into the record in the prior case. And I can't think of any other conditions. So that's my motion. Thank you, Mr. Is there a second?  Second. Mr. Mr. Holy. Mr. Hi. Ms. Hoffman. Hi. Mr. LeBlanc. Hi. Mr. Klein isn't here in the chair votes. Aye. And so the motion is granted. So thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you for your, your presentation and. And good luck with it. Thank you guys. Have a great night. Thank you. Okay.

<details><summary>14 Oakland Avenue - Docket #3754</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 37</summary>

> Our next, the next case we have. Coming up is 14 Oakland Avenue. And I believe that the applicant in this case. Is represented by. Ms. Anne. Good evening. Are we ready? Yes. Please. Please go forward.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ms. Anne - 583</summary>

> Thank you. and they live at 14 Oakland Ave with their twochildren. What they're looking to do is to put an addition on theirhome. And we have submitted plans to the Zoning Board and Vu Alexanderis going to show you those. Vu, if you can get them up on the screennow, that might be a good tool. Is Vu, he's allowed to do that? Verygood. Okay. One of the images I want to be shown, Vu, is thedifference in elevation from the right side of the property down tothe left side, the lower side of the property. There is a significantdifference in elevation. And I believe a line has been drawn to showwhat that drop in elevation is. That makes the lot different than someother lots in the neighborhood with respect to making it, in my view,unique. That's the reason why I have filed for both a variance and aspecial permit. One of the items that you'll see on the dimensionalform is that we are saying that we are going to have threestories. Well, we're not going to really have three stories becausethat new space is going to be devoted to mechanical and utilities. Andif you go to the bylaw, it's section 5.3.22, further subsection B,further subsection two, basement areas devoted exclusively tomechanical uses accessory to the operation of the building are notincluded in the calculation of growth for area. So our position isthat in fact, we come out of that three-story calculation because ofthat. What we're planning on doing is moving the mechanicals and theutilities in the other portions of the building into the new space. Sothe new space would contain the boiler. We're going to be doing a newair conditioning setup in the building. Right now, the airconditioning is window air conditioning and David, the husband worksfrom the home. So during the summer months, it's fairly humid andfairly difficult to work from home. So we're going to move themechanicals into that space. So that space would be used formechanical and utility. The plan submitted also shows some unfinishedspace that would be generated. That unfinished space would remainunfinished space. And if that's what the board indicates in theirfindings, then it would be unfinished space. The, we're asking for therelief probably under the variance portion and not the special permitportion, but I did file for both just to open the door for both. Ifwe're talking about a variance, we know that what we need to show iswe need to show hardship relating to the land, okay? And I'm going toargue and suggest to the members of the board that the hardshiprelating to the land is the difference in elevation from one portionof the property down to the other. I mentioned in my application thatI filed that the property has unusual characteristics, primarily adifference in elevation at the property, which demonstrates thatconstructing an addition at the rear on the current first floor andsecond floor level would necessitate a walkout basement. We're tryingto avoid that, get around that, yet get some additional space for thefamily. The additional space that would free up in the alreadyexisting portion of the building would allow more room for the twoyoung children of the homeowners to have room to play, which they donot really have now. So we're asking for that relief from theboard. I'd like Vu to go through the plans with you to show you whatwe're proposing. And I'd like to come back on after he does that andhave a few more things to say. Vu, can you-
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 333</summary>

> Mr. Annecy, could I, Mr. Annecy, could I just, I don't want to interrupt, but it would be useful for me to raise this now before Mr. Alexander shows the screens. Assuming, let me just assume for a moment that in your application, in the application, it indicates that the existing house is two stories and the house with the addition would be three. And I know that you have arguments about what a story ought to mean, but let me just set those aside for a second. If the existing house had three stories, in other words, if the foundation, the average grade were such that the basement in that part of the house was a separate story, then you'd be taking a three-story house and extending what I assume would be an existing nonconformity to the addition so that it would go from three to three without introducing a new nonconformity. And the reason I raised this is because just at its last meeting, the board had two similar cases, one of which it approved when it did not, when the change did not involve a introduction of a new nonconformity. And in the other was, you just heard today as we adopted the decision in the beginning, rejected the argument that a sharp downgrade, downward slope such as you're having here qualified as a situation in which the topology introduced the hardship. So obviously, as you know, it's a lot easier to prevail on a special permit. And I was wondering if you could gather your thoughts and think about this later, but in particular, if Mr. Alexander could discuss whether the argument, it seems counterintuitive, but in some ways you're better off if the existing house is three stories than if it's two stories. And that's a matter of arithmetic, of course, but it would be useful to hear your views on that. No question about it. Can I have Vu jump in now? Please do. Yes, please. Vu?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vu Alexander - 771</summary>

> Yes, this is Vu Alexander. Thank you for giving us an opportunity for presenting this to you. Can you see my screen?  Yes. It's kind of small. If you could make it a little bigger, it'd be helpful, but otherwise we can do our best. Great. So the existing houses, it's a two-story colonial house. It has a hip roof, shingle style. It's well-kept by the owner, and it's a very modest house. So the north side of the house is, if you look at the living room on the top of the page, to the north side of the house, the property drops off pretty dramatically. It's from the front of the house to the back of the house is about nine feet. And I think the whole lot originally was very, it just drops off. And when the development of this area got built in, I think they fill in around the property, around the dining room, the entry, and create a garage, driving garage down into the basement. So half of the property, I think, is from the north to the northeast is exposed in terms of the basement, right? And the other half is cover by finished grades. So it's the average grade right now, I think if we were to do the average grade. So it's still very close or can maintain a two-story home or residential home. When the owner proposed to add to this home, they're proposing to add a 19 by 18 family room off the first floor and a primary suite off the second floor and extend that to the back of the house. You know, that, so majority of these, all of the addition right now is at above the basement level, right? So all three sides of the addition is at the basement level and exposed to above grade, finished grade in the back of the house. You know, the addition, the reason we wanted to extend the barren walls down to the basement level to support it on top of a new foundation instead of having posts and beams exposed supporting the two structure above. So that was kind of the methods and means of which we wanted to support the two structure. And this is the first floor. And that's, and that's the second floor primary bedroom. So this all, so the new structure is based on the extension of the existing colonial house with the hip roof and the details and the wood shingles and the windows detail. So it'll fit right in with what's there. And, you know, visually it will be integrated into the details and the style of the house. And the first, in the basement level, there's a one car garage that not being used and there is a unfinished basement with mechanical space and storage space. So the new addition that we're projecting the barren walls down to the new foundation below create a new one-story basement that we're proposing to, we're proposing to, you know, relocate all the mechanicals into this unfinished basement and proposing to rework or leave the existing unfinished basement where it is. If you look at the front elevation, so you can see the west and south side of the house is basically was filled in, I'm assuming, when it did its construction and kept the grade naturally from front to back on the north side of the house, where they use it as a garage and a walkout basement. And this is the south side of the house where right now there's a side entry to the house and there's the homeowner did a really nice job with landscape steps, transitioning down to the existing patio that the basement is walking out onto. And this is the addition that we're proposing to project into the back of the house, backyard. And look in the back of the house, this is the existing elevation of what's there. There's the window into the basement and is the finished gray. The patio is a little bit above the finished basement floor. And we step down into the basement level. And this elevation, it shows you the natural grading of the site, how it just, you know, it drops out pretty dramatically from the front of the street to the back of the house. And it keeps going to the back of the lots, you know, drop another five, six feet. So it's, and that's pretty much, you know, it's a very simple design, very simple layout. Just we're dealing with existing grades and the contours of the site.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 41</summary>

> So Mr. Alexander, when you're just out there looking at it, it looks pretty similar to the grades that exist both up the street and down the street. Is the topography significantly different here than it is on those neighboring properties?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vu Alexander - 115</summary>

> No, they're pretty much the same, but the neighboring properties, they're larger homes and they're, they added, they all have these retaining walls, right? That transition from property to property, like the house on the South side has this large retaining walls where it becomes like a garage and it transitioned down to their back of property. And the house on the North side, it's the same. It's a large, they're larger homes and they extended way, you know, further back than this house. And they all have these retaining wall that kind of holds up the properties. And kept this existing grade where it is. It was like a sandwich between two larger homes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 122</summary>

> Great. Could I ask you on the beginning, on the house that we currently have before the addition, have you done any calculations to determine whether the ceiling is four and a half feet above the average finished grade? I mean, have you actually calculated that?  Yeah, so right now the finished floor, there's four and a half feet from the basement floor. Let me just be clear about this. I want to pretend now that the addition hasn't been built, isn't proposed. And I just want to focus on the existing building as it is, with the existing finished grade as it is. And I would like to know whether or not you've done a calculation on just that part.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Hamlin - 122</summary>

> Yes,sir. Hi, I'm the owner. And actually we have a comment to say about that because we've had surveys done by Rover Survey. And the initial one that he had done when we had got property stuff had said it was two stories. But when we asked them to do calculations as Rick Valarelli had recommended for us to do from the topography and the heights of the house and the basement and all that stuff, they had actually said that our basement would be a third story because the height requirement isn't meant for it to just be the basement. So it actually, according to the survey, is actually written as being a third story. And the most updated plot plan.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 27</summary>

> Yeah, so I don't know if that helps us or not. Let's find out if Vu has done the calculations, Kathy. Have you done the calculations, Vu?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Vu Alexander - 308</summary>

> Well, my calculation is from the finish, from the rough, floor joist is four foot one to the four foot six of the grades of the basement floor. I guess just to maybe help clarify what we're trying to get at is the basement is considered a story when it's four and a half feet from the finished ceiling to the average grade. So if we knew what the average, if we had a diagram on like this elevation, for example, of what that average grade was and what that dimension was to the average grade from the finished ceiling of the basement, that's the dimension that we're trying to drive at to get to this point of is the basement a story and so on and so forth. So, because I think a little backwards at the moment. The dimension should be from the ceiling to the average grade. Right, so the existing average grade of the, from the north side, the extreme side, right? It is- Well, it's for the site. Yes, so it is almost eight feet plus or minus the average grade, right in the middle of the house to the underside of the basement structure is unfinished. So it's, you know, it's seven, 10, seven, 11, almost eight feet. So that's the average is four feet then, right? I'm saying the average ceiling height. is four feet above the average grade? Yes. And that's the worst case scenario. And in the back where it's a walkout, yeah, where it's a walkout is a little bit better because the grades comes up and the patio comes up to the basement floor. If you count that as finished grade around the house. Because there is a transitional retaining wall, steps, patio that gets you down to the back of the house, to the walkout basement.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Annessi - 567</summary>

> Mr. Nacy, do you wanna?  Well, I mean, you mentioned that you had a case last week that are the last hearing that I was unaware. Was that voted favorably, Mr. Hanley?  The variance was denied. It was denied. The variance was denied on the basis of the first of the variance criteria, whereas the special permit that was based on a section six finding was granted. Okay, all right. The, perhaps I need to make a transition then from seeking a variance, okay, to seeking a special permit. And I'd like to be able to track what occurred in that case. Unfortunately, I was not on the Zoom, so I didn't hear the case and I haven't seen the case since that last hearing. But I think I would, as we all know, it's much more favorable to a homeowner to apply and obtain a special permit than would be the case with a variance. You mentioned yourself just now, the other houses on Oakland Ave that are similar to this particular house in terms of the drop in grade. And I suppose there are. And one of the issues with respect to granting a variance, of course, is that you need to show that your situation is unique. And Vu has made some arguments as to why our situation may be unique. With respect to larger houses, retaining walls and the like, but if I could proceed on the basis of a special permit, that would make it much easier for my clients. I'm throwing that out there without having seen that case of a month or so ago. Well, let me just say this, we haven't done a public hearing yet, so we probably ought to do that. But given the, I mean, where we are right now is that Inspectional Services believes that both the addition and the, or both the house with the addition and the house, the existing house would be three stories based on their views as the owners have indicated. We've been sort of orally through some calculations here, which have all of the advantages and disadvantages of things that are done here. But our ability to understand what this was all about on the record would probably be improved by your having an opportunity to follow this path more and to assemble what it is, and maybe to get together with ISD and see if you can identify where it is you agree to see, and maybe to provide us with a little bit more information that's focused on this other possibility that hasn't been before us yet. That'll also give you a chance to look at the two cases that we had last week or last month, which sort of provide a brace and illustrate the difference between going for a variance in this kind of situation and going for a special or a section six finding. So we'd be perfectly happy if you wanted to do that. But what we have just said, isn't all anybody might say about this, and there is the public to be heard, and this is a public hearing. So we probably should get through any other questions that the board may have and go to the public hearing, and then we can return to this question then if that's all right with you. That's fine, yep. Mr. Chairman.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Dupont. - 369</summary>

> So as I am not an architect, it's not as easy for me to look at these plans and be able to sort of picture what the average finished grade is. And so if in fact it's the applicant's position that they don't believe that the basement counts as a story, we would want, or I would want to have something from an engineer, an architect, a surveyor to show exactly what the calculations are to demonstrate that under the definitions of both basement and story in the bylaw that you were not a story. I think at this point, as Mr. Hanlon suggested, inspectional services believes that the basement is a story. And so I, again, would reiterate what others have said about the properties in the surrounding area. I go up and down Oakland probably two to three times a day. So I'm familiar with the incline. And I think both across the street, as well as on the same side of the street, you have similar topography. And so I think that what Mr. Hanlon had said in the very beginning, which is there's a question, I suppose, in going for a variance where you're trying to distinguish your property as being unique as compared to the others, that might be a bit different than if you were coming in and saying that we do have three stories and we're looking to extend the nonconformity. And I'm not trying to put- And that's what I'd like to focus on. And so, and Mr. Anessi, I would just say that the decision was really the one we voted on tonight, which is 20 Martin Street. So if you wanted to take that down, that's really what you're, I think, what you're looking at. Yep. The other one, as I recall, Roger, the one we granted, which again, I think the two of them are most usefully looked at together because they show the yin and yang of the thing, was, I believe, 48 Oakland, wasn't it? That may well be a little bit of a failure in memory here, but that sounds right. Mr. Alston, could you remind, do you happen to know that off your hand?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 134</summary>

> We don't need to do this. I can do this offline and give Mr. Anessi the references. Yeah, I'd appreciate that. I think that is the way I want to proceed at this point. Kathy, I haven't talked with you about that, but we're getting good advice and suggestions from the members of the board. And I'd like to follow up on that and see if we can come up with a plan that basically can pass muster. Are you in agreement with that, Kathy? Yes, we are. Okay, thank you. Hey, this is a public hearing. If there's no more questions or comments from the board, the rules for public hearing are the same as they were in the last two cases. And is there anyone here who wishes to address this application?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Moore - 34</summary>

> Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. Could you refresh my memory as to the situation in which the planning board develops a memo to advise the ZBA on a particular application?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 117</summary>

> Well, this is not entirely routine. In recent times, the planning, this is one of the things that as a matter of practice they have done in the past. They have been doing it less often recently in part because they're very shorthanded and there's a lot of other things that are going on. That was always just a practice. There's no requirement to have a memorandum from the planning board, although we consider them helpful when the planning board has an opportunity to do them. But they have not had the personnel really for the last couple of weeks to be, or last several meetings to be able to provide the memorandum that they usually do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Moore - 18</summary>

> Mr. Chair, is it your understanding that they're going to recommence that process when they become less shorthanded?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 22</summary>

> I have, I don't know because it's not, well, I do not have an understanding on that one way or the other.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Moore - 67</summary>

> Okay. The only reason I bring it up is in the past when I've reviewed various applications of this type and others, I found that myself helpful as a private citizen. And I was surprised to see them not existing lately. And I would hope that they would return because I think that's a particularly good use of the planning board. But anyway, thank you, Mr. Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 150</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Moore. Is there any, is anyone else here to address this application? Okay. So going once, twice, right? The public hearing is closed. We'll turn to the, I guess, Mr. Anessi, this is the time when if you would like to request a continuance, this would be appropriate time to do that. I would like to do that to the next meeting of the zoning board. So the next meeting to the zoning board is for a comprehensive permit. And I know that this is a painful because in the summer, we don't have, I mean, everything goes slower, but the next meeting is July 11th. That's a comprehensive permit for 10 Sunnyside. And Ms. Raulston, when is the next meeting for regular cases after that? I do have some people on for the 27th. All right. Okay, the 27th, it would then be the appropriate date.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Annessi - 13</summary>

> That would be acceptable to my client if it's acceptable to the town.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 27</summary>

> Okay, is, I guess at this point, is there anyone on the board, the chair would entertain a motion to accept Mr. Anessi's request for a continuance.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 28</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, just a query. The 27th, are we talking 27th of July? That happens to be a Thursday. I'm just questioning whether or not that was intentional.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 255</summary>

> Ms. Raulston? No, I tried to get back on. It's the 25th, Tuesday, the 25th. Okay. So the date for the continuance would be a date certain of Tuesday, July 25th at 7.30, or as soon thereafter as the case may be heard. That okay with you, Kathy? Mr. Chairman? Mr. DuPont? So I would make a motion that the hearing on this matter be continued to Tuesday, July 25th at 7.30. Is there a second? Second. Seconded by Mr. Holey. Mr. Anessi, just to make sure that we've nailed this down, that continuance is acceptable to you? Kathy, are you okay with that? Yes, we're okay with that. How about Vu? Are you okay with that? I think I'm around the 27th. I think I'm around the 25th. Yes, we are. All right, thank you very much. We'll do a roll call vote. Mr. DuPont? Aye. Mr. Holey?  Aye. Mr. Ricardelli? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. The chair votes aye, and Mr. Klein is absent. So the motion for continuance is approved. So we'll take this up again at the next available meeting. And I'd encourage you, you know, just as a matter of practice to just is to work closely with ISD on this. It will make everything a lot easier for everyone if everybody, if you all are on the same page and see it the same way. Thank you. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate your time and look forward to seeing you again next month.

<details><summary>60 Aerial Street - Docket #3755</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 58</summary>

> So the final case tonight is 60 Ariel, is it 60 or 61?  61. 61 Ariel Street. And who's going to represent the applicant on this one? Ms. Waldron, there are two Ms. Waldrons. And so Laura, your name is actually what's on the screen, but okay, go ahead. Let's tell us what you'd like to do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Lauren Walden - 252</summary>

> All right, good evening. I'm Lauren Walden and this is my wife, Emily Walden. And we're here tonight requesting a special permit for our home at 61 Ariel Street for a large addition, sort of similar to the first one of the night. We've lived at this address since January, 2010. And since moving in, we've expanded our family and now have three kids who are ages three, eight, and 11, who are attending preschool and public school in Arlington. And the five of us currently have a two bedroom, one bathroom home. So space is very tight for us. We love our neighbors. We love our street that we live on. And we don't want to have to move out of this great neighborhood to fit our family and to stay here. And so we've planned an addition that will give us two additional bedrooms so that everybody gets their own room and doesn't have to share. And a second bathroom to accommodate our now larger family. The addition exceeds 750 square feet, which is why we're here for the special permit, but we're complying with all of the setbacks. So there's no easements or anything like that. And we work to make the layout as efficient as possible to meet our family's needs and fit with the character of the neighborhood. Our contractor, architect, and several supportive neighbors are on the call as well. And please let us know if you have any questions and thank you for your time.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 29</summary>

> Great, thank you. I wonder if maybe your architect could walk us through the drawing so that we can get a better sense of what you're asking to do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Alexandra Peterson - 502</summary>

> Yes, I can definitely do that. Alexandra Peterson representing Laura and Emily and Derby Square Architects. Let me see if I can share my screen. Let's see. Are you able to see my screen?  Starting. Okay. There you go. Let me just get to the first page and then kind of go from there. Okay, so the current home is 900 square feet and it's basically doesn't have the needs of the family. I apologize, I need to make this too many screens on my screen. There we go. Hopefully, this will do it. Okay, so we're basically proposing a, so the current home is one and a half stories, kind of a standard cake. And we're basically proposing an addition that's basically an extension to the homeowners off of the homeowners in-ground garage. So it would make it basically kind of like a two story home. Basically kind of like a two and a half story addition. The slope kind of allows for that. So we're not changing much in terms of the actual slope of on-site and we're not changing on the parking or I'm not sure why my screen is freezing up on you guys. I'm sorry. Here it is. So on your left, you will see the existing house and then on your right of the screens, you should see basically the proposed. So the home currently has kind of a single story garage that's being used as a storage. We're keeping it as a storage room and then the entire basement is more or less being used as a storage. So we're kind of just keeping that as an unfinished space and a storage, but more of a walkout kind of situation. And then on the first floor, we're adding a bedroom and a master suite with a new bathroom. And in the attic, we are doing two extra bedrooms for the kids that are all in the attic space within the half stories, but we're not changing anything within the existing roof structure. So that is still maintaining to be just a very attic kind of storage space. And if you see the home, it's actually very, very small and very, the attic is kind of, and then I'm gonna share the actual existing house and the street view. Can you see that now? The street view of the house. So current house is, basically it is kind of very historical looking cape and we're trying with the new addition to kind of maintain those historical details to kind of make it fit with the existing house as well as the neighborhood. The driveway and the curb cut will remain the same. We're just slightly changing the slope of the driveway and then allowing for the addition to basically appear right in front of this existing garage in this area over here. So, I'm happy to walk you through to any questions, but I hope that gave you a pretty good summary of what's happening.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 46</summary>

> Okay, was there any questions of the board have a question in terms of the overall size of the current house you had mentioned it was 900 square feet in your application has 1530 square feet and I wondered what the reason is for the difference.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Alexandra Peterson - 164</summary>

> So I believe I'm maybe Lauren Emily and or am the cancer contractor will be able to say a little bit more about that when we were calculating the square footage and talking to the inspector. He basically inclined that we should be including the basement in our calculations, because of the fact that technically the basement is a walkout and being converted, even though it's actually is a basement and currently is 3.3 feet, four inches from the ground to the ceiling. So it's not a really usable space inside the basement it's only currently six foot two inches or so in the existing basement we're making it a one foot drop in the existing and the new addition so it becomes a seven foot, two inch space on the ground. Um, but again the family is mostly planning to use it as an actual unfinished space for the time being. And again, Laura Emily or Aaron feel free to chime in otherwise.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Lauren Walden - 25</summary>

> That sounds right. Yeah. The current basement is I'm five foot four and it's, it's short for me. So the current is a little bit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 101</summary>

> So I wonder if you could comment on on. I noticed that they've got at least one symptom fairly a significant looking tree on the. The neck of the woods they used to call the devil strip but it would be just just off the curb. Another one in the yard, and it looks as if it's possible that there are some more around back I wonder what, if you could describe what the situation is with respect to trees on the property, and, and which, if any, would be removed or put in danger by the plants that you have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Lauren or Alexandra? - 175</summary>

> We've got on theproperty we've got for mature oaks, there are, you can see themthey're all kind of behind the house the large mature oaks. So one offto the side and then two more in the back and one in the farcorner. And then we've got one large evergreen that's kind of right upalong that hedge behind the property line and that's that's clear outin the back as well. I think there's these two in the front here. Oneoff to the side on the Washington Street, and then a small maple in inthe back. And the current we don't currently have any plans for forremoving any trees as part of it. You know, in the front might be kindof in the zone there but it's not not anywhere. I don't believe it isjust because we're not doing any change to the curb cut and actuallythe driveway is actually going to be, in a sense, just going a littlebit more. If anything, some of the bushes will probably be removed butnot none of the mature trees.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 12</summary>

> Okay. Does anybody any further questions from members of the board. Mr.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr Holy - 37</summary>

> So if I understand the drawings correctly, they used to be a garage. And now it's going to be an unfinished space right to the driver be used for the garage, as it for the car park.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Lauren Walden - 154</summary>

> Yeah, is that right now we have, we've got a tandem garage but with a minivan and an SUV we can't fit them in the garage. And so we'll continue parking in the driveway as we have been. And there is no. In the future usage of this space for a garage right assume it's going to be used as a family room and no more. Yeah, no, we, we looked at, you know, we considered the possibility of including a garage. Given, you know, the per square foot construction costs we'd rather not park a vehicle in there we'd rather, you know, have our kids roller skate down there and, and, you know, have extra storage and the reason for asking is that in, if that is the case, there is a separation requirement for the garage from the main space so it's just curious on if that is being considered or not.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Holy - 48</summary>

> I had another follow up question is the height of the new edition, how high is it relative to the existing ridgeline, it seems about three to four feet but I just want to know from the architect. What is the difference in the height difference. 30 inches.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Applicant? - 8</summary>

> Yeah, 30 inches two and a half feet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 39</summary>

> Okay. Thank you. Is there anything else from the board. Right, this is a public hearing is the same rules apply is have applied up to now. Is there anyone who is here to address this application. Mr more.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 76</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Steve more people on street. First off, just one question this is a, this is a pretty large edition looks by the size of the architectural drawings larger than the original house. And I guess with some grading down below the grade that's currently showing or maybe it's just my misinterpretation. What has been, I assume the neighbors were reached out to and what was their response Mr chair that's my first question.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Lauren Walden - 49</summary>

> I would think that probably is to Mr. Yeah, we actually have a couple of our neighbors, yes we do reach out to our neighbors, and we've actually got some of them on the line including one who's hand up is his hand is up for right after you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 273</summary>

> Great news Mr. It sounds like they, the good neighbor policy is sometimes spottily enforced and it sounds like that did occur here which is good news. These are large trees, and again, I mentioned the addition is large. There's going to have to be some significant protection for the root zone, particularly the tree that is in front of the house also there seems to be on one on one street you there's a very large white fence that wraps around one side of the house it's missing in the other street you on the other side of the house I don't quite know I assume the fence will be modified or whatever to take that in. I'm confused by the fencing appearing one of the street views, but there's going to have to be some root protection, and it is since this is a large addition there's going to have to be a tree plan in this consult with the board and then the tree plan has to be created by a certified arborist and the public street tree of course is already a public tree that will, I assume, probably not be touched on the process here. It's hard for me to tell whether or not that tree in front of the house is within the setback I believe it is. I assume aerial street is a public way. So I think that's in the setback, and would be that would be a protected tree. So anyway, just that advice is to go approach the tree warden with this and tree plan before any demolition gets done. Thank you, Mr.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 60</summary>

> Thank you Mr more. Is there anyone else who wishes to wishes to address the application. Okay, seeing none. We'll close the public hearing, and I've got I'm sorry I've got something in front. I, I beg your pardon. I have a very congested screen and it congested some people right off it. But Miss Thompson I think was next.

<details><summary>	 Deb Thompson - 206</summary>

> Hi, good evening I'm Deb Thompson and I live at 54 aerial street across the street from Laura and Emily and their, their great family. And I live in the house that my mom grew up in so I've seen that house for 62 years. And it's, it's, to the best of my knowledge it's a lot and a half. I believe. And the house was always in great shape. And then the previous owner was older and wasn't able to take care of it and Lauren Emily came in, and they've done the best that they can to try and maintain the way it is right now. But I'm thrilled that they're going to put an addition on, I know how how how small the house is because Mr Clark who built all of these houses is pretty much the same footprint for all of them. And I know, I don't know how my, my mother with her parents lived in that footprint. And you two with three kids. It's kind of difficult. So I'm thrilled. I wish you all the best. And if you guys need anything more. We have a great neighborhood, just reach out to us. Thank you, Miss Thompson. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Mr Gustafson - 211</summary>

> Oh, thank you. I live at 50 aerial street, not directly but kind of diagonally across from Laura and Emily. And I just really want to echo what Deb Deborah Thompson said is that I think this will be great. Not only for Laura and Emily and their family, but for the property and for the house neighborhood as well. There's numerous other houses in our neighborhood that have gone through kind of similar renovations, and I have not seen any sort of negative effects from those additions that have been done. I think it would be a huge quality of life improvement for their family, which I think would carry for for to any, you know, people that would own the house in the future. As Deborah said, I think most of the neighbors are quite envious of Laura and Emily's lot, it's huge. So, you know, I think there's plenty of room there. I would be thinking the same thing if it were my property. So, my full support. I don't think it's going to ruin the view out of my front windows. And I know it's just an opinion, it's certainly not going to overcome any sort of restrictions but again my full support to them. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Now Bandian - 95</summary>

> Thank you. I think it's either. Well, I should. Next up is mostly and we'll get to Mr now bandian. Next, I'm just following the water on my screen. Good evening. I just also wanted to come on and just say that I'm very supportive of Lauren Emily's plans. I live right next door. If the, if you were looking at the view that the architect showed the house on the right so number 57. So immediately abutting them, and we're very supportive and we're really excited for them to start the project. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 RM Alpha Construction - 571</summary>

> Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Mr Chairman. My name is RM I owner of alpha construction and I've walked into many various houses and, you know, looked at additions and houses are huge. So, I walked into Lars and Emily's house, tiny house. I feel like they need the space. They are so crammed three children. They, they're wonderful family, and the addition that's going to be done is going to be beautiful, and I would just hope that the board considers giving them their space that they require tree wise. I know there was a concern from Mr more. We're very diligent I've worked in this town for many years I pulled multiple permits. We do the tree plan that's in that's that's in next phase. So, no concerns there I've done multiple properties building a 5000 square foot house now. So we're very diligent and we're very aware of what the town needs and, and what the town needs for, you know, going forward to support the trees and whatever that neighborhood needs. So, thank you. Thank you very much. Is there anybody else who wishes to address this application. Mr share. Mr share you have your hand up. William share. Yes. Hello. Can you hear me, I can. Okay, I'm a little, I'm not a very experienced zoom user. I just want to say that I also have taken a look at the plans and I really applaud the efforts that they've obviously made to tie the addition into the with the existing building. You know, if you note that the in the front, they have that kind of gabled roof element, the dormer element that mimics the entry of their existing house. And so I think they've done a nice job with the design there. And I'm happy. Also that people have pointed out the issue with the trees because our neighborhood has lost recently about six or seven major trees. And I'm glad that I hope that they have some beautiful trees there that they can be saved. I should note that I can tell you that the, the tree that's right in front of their house, right at the curb is sick, and I'm sure it's going to die very soon. So, people should be aware of that. That's already a lost tree I think. And then the only thing that I would maybe just urge, I don't know whose purview this is, but I think on a lot of projects. One of the things that gets done sort of on an ad hoc basis is like the, you know, the compressors and the heating units and the cooling units, and all those things and they sort of, they never show up on the plans. And, but then of course, they need to go somewhere, and they often just get placed on almost, you know, in a place that's, I don't know, not just maybe convenient for the installer but not necessarily best for the neighborhood so I just hope that some work can be taken there in terms of where the placement of these various mechanical systems will be. Terrific. All right. Is there any questions. I also, I also just want to say I second, you know, I can't believe that they've been raising such a large family in such a small house so I definitely commiserate with them. But it's great family.

> Mr more you have another shot at it. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 89</summary>

> Thank you, Mr chairman yes for a second. I just want to suggest that when they approach the pre morning to talk about protection and develop the tree plan that they should just see look at that street tree because if it truly is sick or dying the way many trees are on the street, the town can take it down. And then can replant in the area or the applicants can request a street tree for their property which is very easy process, just a suggestion. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 86</summary>

> Thank you Mr more. Yeah, and in reply to that Mr more we did contact the town arborist, a couple years back when we noticed that it seemed sick and they came out, they trimmed it and they said it's good for now so maybe they'll take a look again. Mr Mr more I wonder I have a question for you, if you're, if you're still there you are. When, when people talk about the town arborist. Is that a separate position from the tree warden.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Moore - 107</summary>

> Just to give you some confusion here on the town, the Department of Public Works has a tree crew, which is comprised of a number of three climbers manager that kind of thing but three warden is the head of the tree to feed division, so to speak, though she may have a division lead that some of the different name the tree warden is the sort of final authority, but the, I'm not sure there's a town arborist which is separate from from Tim, we've was the tree warden currently. But the tree crew folks all have various expertises that probably gets worried now and again.

<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 76</summary>

> Thank you. So can I. I'm not sure whether Mr. Mr share both of whom have their hands up stills are with us just left over with you want to speak again. They will disappear. Disappearing hands. Is there any. Is there any other anyone else from the public who wishes to address this going. Tracy and Michael Keller. Yes. Can you hear me.

> I'm sorry this is Tracy. Okay, you're working nice you're up. Okay. I met my husband and I are at 51 area. We've been there since 1990. We've watched people come and go, we've watched, we've actually done additions to our home. Awesome.

So, my Michael and I both very excited about them doing this project.

My kids currently share room we have a small house and I totally get it and I think I, I just, I'm so excited for their family and I am in full support and it's going to be so fabulous for them to enjoy their space.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 375</summary>

> Thank you very much, Miss Keller. Thank you. So how is there anyone else going, going. Okay, gone. So the public hearing is closed, it's been, it's been an edifying and inspiring conversation and I thank you all for stepping in. If the board were inclined to grant this application for a special permit for a large edition. The. We would presumably want to use the three standard conditions. I would suggest that in light of the discussion on the on trees that the discussion, the condition that we adopted in the first case that we heard tonight. Relating to consulting with the tree warden. Might be an appropriate addition as well. Does anyone wish to add. Have any other condition that they have in mind that might be appropriate in this case. Okay, seeing none. It's up to the board of course whether they're interested in the fourth condition that that I just indicated. At this point the chair will enter would entertain a motion to approve. Mr DuPont. I would like to move the board approve the application for the construction of the additional under 5.25 point 4.2 D six of the zoning bylaw, and as was just mentioned include the three standard conditions and then the fourth condition. I would like to move the board approve the application for the construction of the additional under 5.25 point 4.2 D six of the zoning bylaw, and as was just mentioned include the three standard conditions and then the fourth condition. Okay, the motion has been made by Mr DuPont is there a second. Second. Seconded by either Mr. You can give it to Mr. Mr holy is already pretty much monopolized the second all the evening so you can you can fight for it you'll you can flip a coin later on, we'll, we'll say seconded by someone. The. To approve with four conditions. We'll do a roll call vote. Mr DuPont. Mr. Mr Holy. Aye. Mr. Aye. Mr. Aye. Mr. Aye. Mr blank. Mr blank. Mr Klein is absent in the chair votes. Aye. So, thank you for spending your evening with us, and congratulations. Thank you so much. Thank you. So the hearing on this is closed as we've discussed earlier

<details><summary>Adjourn</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 571</summary>

> , the, in terms of where we're going on July 11, we're going to have a hearing on 10 sunny side. I expected that point that will be able for the first time to have some input from the town's peer review consultant. On the 25th, we have a regular meeting scheduled with at this point. I think it's two cases that look like they may appear then. One thing I wanted to bring up to everyone is that 10 sunny side won't be over. After July, 11. There will be two or perhaps three more sessions of that hearing I believe. And part of it will be to, to work through with the issues that Tetra tech may have with the application and to make sure that those things are done. We always have, and this could be conceivably connected with the responses to the Tetra tech comments. We always sort of do a wrap up to review the various things that have been raised and make sure that we have not forgotten overlooked anything, or that we at least know what, what the responses are to all of that. And then finally after we do all that. We generally get an opinion from draft opinion from the board's consultant. Mr Haverty, and spend at least some time giving the applicant and the public, an opportunity to discuss those conditions to discuss the way they're worded to discuss what isn't there what is there, and to make sure that that we understand what the issues are. And then we'll close the public hearing. And go into the radio silence that characterizes our deliberations. I've looked a little bit at where the where possible Tuesdays are. Obviously we've just gone through July. The end, I have some information as to where you are and if I forgot and didn't put it on the words calendar. I apologize but hope to be corrected in my ways. Excuse me, August. The August 1 August 15 and August 29 are all Tuesdays in August, which I don't know for sure that somebody is there is going to not be able to to to be on the, on the call and I think I sent around a email earlier today asking you to let me know, which if any of those days might work for you, which definitely don't work for you is more is even more important. And I think that will probably want to use one of them we might want to use two of them. The 15th and the 29th have better spacing, maybe than others. And I'm hoping that we can bring the this app, this application to a conclusion, the hearing on the application to a conclusion. By, by the middle of February. So if you could look at your calendars, we still got to talk to the applicant, we still have got to talk to the peer review consultant there's lots of other people who have schedules that are all difficult to manage during the summertime but we need to sort of set something up in order to be able to avoid losing our momentum after July 11. All right, so I have nothing more to say does anyone else have anything they would like to bring up, bring to the attention of the board. Why you look as if there's something that you would like to talk about.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Patrick Hanlon - 346</summary>

> Yeah, I've been doing this too long now you now you know, figure me out. I will say that, you know, I've been coming to this meeting for a while and this is the first instance I can remember where Mr Klein was not around. And although I'm sure there's been other instances where I've just not been in a meeting. It was quite noticeable he wasn't here now that's no reflection on you, Mr. Yes, it is, but that's okay. His dedication. His absence shows his dedication. In my view because I've never, never seen him not here. Meanwhile, you're getting quite the workout between this intense on the side. No, not no reflection on you ran the meeting very well Mr handler my humble opinion. I just note that Mr Klein's absence was noted. Well thank you. I noticed I noted it to every second. Mr Klein is is on his vacation, he, I don't know when he when he takes a vacation from his job but he certainly never takes a vacation from us and so I wish him the best team. He certainly needs it he's one of the hardest working people I know. Okay well in the absence of anything else. I think we've come to the point where the chair can entertain a motion to adjourn. So moved, so moved, so moved by Mr DuPont seconded by either Mr rickardelli or Mr wholly depending upon who missed out on the last one. Okay, Mr rickardelli will do it all. We'll do this by by record, the by told vote, whatever it's called. Mr. Mr DuPont. Mr rickardelli. Hi, Mr wholly. Hi, Mr Hoffman. This is Miss Hoffman. Oh, this is so hard. It's late and I got up very early and cuddled his grandchildren so. All right, Miss Hoffman you've done great. I. And I'm about to call on Mr more but I probably shouldn't. The chair votes aye. And the, and the meeting is adjourned. Good night to everybody will look forward to seeing you on July 11. Right.
