</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the addition proposed for 60 High Heath Road by the Nielsons.  Provide as much detail as possible.  Also name the architect and any other contractors involved.</summary>

> The Nielsons proposed an addition to their house at 60 High Heath Road. The addition is designed to accommodate their growing family and make the house more livable. The current house is very small and not suitable for their needs. The addition includes a renovation of the existing house and an extension, which will provide enough space for them to host family when they visit. The addition is larger than 750 square feet, which is why they are applying for a special permit. The architect for the project is Chris Berry. The Nielsons also hired an energy consultant to help design the house to be energy efficient, with features such as triple pane passive certified windows and 100% electrification and solar power on the roof. The Nielsons also mentioned that they had several conversations with the building inspector, Mike, before and after purchasing the house. The contractors involved in the project were not named in the context provided.
</details><details><summary>What were the Board members concern with the 60 High Heath Road addition?</summary>

> The Board members had concerns about the potential removal of trees on the property due to the addition. They requested a tree plan to be submitted for approval by the warden. They also discussed the issue of parking, with some members suggesting that the property should have on-site parking since it was undergoing a large addition. The Board also encouraged the applicants to work closely with the Inspectional Services Department to ensure all aspects of the project were in compliance with local regulations.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the 40-62 Magnolia Street project.</summary>

> The 40-62 Magnolia Street project was presented by Brett Character of Character Construction. The project is a smaller scale compared to the previous one discussed. The plan involves building a double-decker porch with the second unit having access from upstairs and the first unit having shared space down below. This design is common in the neighborhood, with around 50 or 60% of the houses having a similar layout. The project also includes updating the outdated aluminum siding of the house. The porch construction was planned to be done first before the siding. The project does not involve any changes to the existing property line or building line.
</details><details><summary>Was the 40-62 Magnolia Street project approved by the Board?  What concerns were raised?</summary>

> Yes, the 40-62 Magnolia Street project was approved by the Board. Concerns were raised about the placement of mechanical systems such as compressors, heating units, and cooling units, which often get placed in convenient locations for the installer but not necessarily the best for the neighborhood. The Board suggested that more thought should be given to the placement of these systems. There was also a suggestion for the applicant to consult with the tree warden about a sick tree in front of their house.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the 61 Ariel Street project.</summary>

> The 61 Ariel Street project involves a special permit request for a large addition to an existing home. The homeowners, Laura and Emily Walden, have lived at the address since 2010 and have expanded their family to include three children. The current home has two bedrooms and one bathroom, which they find insufficient for their needs. The planned addition will provide two additional bedrooms and a second bathroom. The addition exceeds 750 square feet, hence the need for a special permit, but complies with all setback requirements. The homeowners have also worked with an energy consultant to design the house for decarbonization, including triple pane passive certified windows, 100% electrification, and solar power. The projected HERS rating for the house is negative, meaning it will produce more energy than it consumes.
</details><details><summary>Was the 61 Ariel Street project approved by the Board?  What concerns were raised?</summary>

> Yes, the 61 Ariel Street project was approved by the Board. The main concern raised was about the trees on the property. The Board requested a tree plan to be prepared in consultation with the tree warden prior to the issuance of final building permits. No other significant concerns were raised.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the 14 Oakland Avenue project.</summary>

> The 14 Oakland Avenue project involves a proposal for a large addition to an existing house. The current house is a two-story colonial with a hip roof. The proposed addition includes a 19 by 18 family room off the first floor and a primary suite off the second floor. The addition will extend into the backyard of the property. The basement level will house a one-car garage and an unfinished basement with mechanical space and storage space. The new addition will project the bearing walls down to a new foundation below, creating a new one-story basement. The design of the addition aims to maintain the historical details of the existing house and fit with the character of the neighborhood. The project requires a special permit as the addition exceeds 750 square feet.

The Board also wanted to further consider whether the project required a variance or a special permit.
