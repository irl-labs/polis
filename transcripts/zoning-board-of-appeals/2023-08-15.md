### [Zoning Board of Appeals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdL9wP1DVeA)

<details><summary>Administrative

So we have a few administrative items on our agenda tonight, and I'm going to go through them before we actually start on the hearing. That's our main business tonight. There are three matters. One of them is the approval of the minutes we have had before us for now some time. Minutes from May 23rd, 2023, March 28th, 2023, and February 28th, 2023. And unless there's an objection, I'd like to take all of them together rather than go each one of them separately. But if anyone would want to break any of those sets of minutes out, you should let me know now. Okay. These have been around for us. I think Colleen knows whether she's made any changes in that in response to our comments. Colleen, are these the same things, or have there been changes made? No changes since I sent them out. Okay. So at this point, the Chair will entertain a motion to approve the set of minutes that I just read into the record. Mr. Chair. Mr. Klein. I move that we approve the three sets of minutes previously documented from February, March, and May of this year. Is there a second? Seconded by Mr. DuPont. We'll go through the roll. Christian Klein. Aye. Roger DuPont. Aye. Dan Ricardelli. Aye. Venkat Holi. Aye. Elaine Hoffman. Aye. Adam LeBlanc. Aye. And the Chair votes aye.

<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 168</summary>

> The next item on our agenda is approval of a final decision in docket number 3757, 18 Robin Hood Road. You have had that, actually. There have been virtually no changes in it since what I sent out to you, just correction of some typos. And are there any other corrections that anyone wishes to suggest now for other discussion? All right. Seeing none, the Chair will entertain a motion to approve the final decision in section 3757, 18 Robin Hood Road. Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. So moved. Is there a second?  Second. Seconded by Adam LeBlanc by just a whisker. We'll go through the roll again. I'll... Christian Klein. I wasn't present on the hearing. I wasn't sure if I should vote on it. I think that probably you should not. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Ricardelli. Aye. Mr. Holi. Aye. Ms. Hoffman, I believe you were not there for that one either. Is that correct?  Correct. So Mr. LeBlanc. Aye. And the Chair votes aye.
</details></details>
<details><summary>14 Oakland Avenue - Decision Docket# 3754</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 267</summary>

> The final one is the approval of a final decision in 3734, 14 Oakland Avenue. I wanted to point out for the record, and it's all my fault that this happened, but that on the agenda, it appears actually as 3731, 48 Oakland Avenue, which is a decision that we approved several weeks ago. And you also got this sort of late. I've gotten some comments on that. Again, they were mostly picking up typos. And if you wish to postpone that to give us a little bit more time to revise the notification, we can do that. It's really up to you. But if it is the sense of the Board that we should move forward before the Chair would entertain a motion. Mr. Chairman. Mr. DuPont. I would move to approve the decision. Is there a second? Second. That was Mr. Holi, I think. Mr. LeBlanc. Okay. It's hard to see because my screen is not lighting up when you're speaking. Okay. It's been moved and seconded. We'll go through the roll. Mr. Klein. I think that you were not there for this one either, right? Not present. Mr. DuPont. Aye. Mr. Ricardelli. Aye. Mr. Holi. Aye. Ms. Hoffman, I believe you were there the first night that we had the hearing, but not the second. So in the absence of your position, let me go to Mr. LeBlanc, who was there both nights. Mr. LeBlanc. Okay. So the motion carries in that decision, which again is 14 Oakland Avenue is approved. And we've now gotten through the administrative items. With me for a second.
</details></details>
<details><summary>10 Sunnyside Avenue - Comprehensive Permit</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 697</summary>

> So we're now going to turn to the comprehensive permit hearing for 10 Sunnyside Avenue. The main purpose of tonight's hearing is to review the draft decision that is prepared, was prepared by Mr. Havarty. And our purpose tonight is to make sure that the board has all the facts that it needs to deliberate on that draft during the next phase of the meeting. Tonight is the time for discovering mistakes of fact, possible unintended consequences of proposed conditions, additional facts that might be relevant, and so on, in order to put ourselves in the position that when we go into deliberation mode, that we are, we have the facts that we need in order to make an informed decision. The draft decision is in the board agenda. So if you, if you don't happen to have it readily at hand, if you dial into the agenda, you'll find it there near the end, roughly 450 pages in from the beginning. And I'd encourage you to follow along in the draft because it'll be a lot easier to follow if, if you're able to see the text that people are talking about. So this hearing began many months ago. We've discussed the proposed project in great detail and lots of sessions since then. And at the end of our session tonight, I'm expecting to close the public hearing. Once the hearing is closed, the board will begin a deliberation process that by law can take no longer than 40 days. During that period of time, we can't receive any new information from the applicant, from the town, from the public, from peer review consultant or anyone else. It will, of course, discuss the deliberations with Mr. Havarty, it's 40B legal advisor, and as you know, the principal draftsman of the board's decision. Legally, as I said, we're required to make the decision in 40 days. If we close the public hearing tonight, then our decision will be due no later than Sunday, September 24th. We've scheduled our first deliberation session for Tuesday, September 5th, followed by a second session, if necessary, on September the 12th. Before we get into the details of the hearing, I wanted to stress a couple of things. First of all, the board isn't deliberating tonight, and this isn't the time for the members of the board to be editing Mr. Havarty's draft. We'll have that opportunity to, I'm sure, Mr. Havarty's great regret in September, and if you wanted to see a really tedious meeting, you should see what those are like. Our questions tonight will be aimed at making sure the board has the record it needs in order to make an informed decision. See if I can find it. I guess the second thing is that, again, we should be following through the decision as we can, and people talk about it. One helpful thing would be to refer to things by number. If you're looking at part four, section C1, I know it's hard to make yourself do that, but it would be helpful to others who are trying to find it and to Ms. Raulston, who is going to be trying to show these on the screen, to know which is the language that you're talking about. And second is that not everybody is going to have a copy of the opinion before them, and so if you can just say enough about what it is you're planning to talk about so that somebody who's not following along in the text is able to understand the drift of the discussion, that would be helpful. And so with that, what I'd like to do at the beginning is to ask Mr. Haverty to explain a little bit what the document is that we all have before us, how it fits into this process, and what its general structure is, and then I think we would move next to Ms. Stanley O'Connor to have the applicant comment on how that decision looks to them and where they have problems or suggestions or additional conditions or provisions to add. So, Mr. Haverty, I wonder if you could start us off.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Haverty - 968</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we know, this is an application for a comprehensive permit pursuant to General Laws, Chapter 40B, Sections 20 to 23. And the way that the Chapter 40B works is that the Board of Appeals actually is the permit granting authority for all local approvals necessary for the project to move forward. So that, of necessity, requires a fairly complex decision from the Board. Under Chapter 40B, there are three different possibilities of what a Board can issue of a decision. It can either approve the application as submitted, which I literally have never seen happen ever. It can approve the application with conditions, or it can deny the application. So in this instance, we've moved forward drafting a decision with the presumption that it was going to be an approval with conditions. And the purpose of the conditions is to make sure that the Board is actually addressing issues of local concern, which is sort of the fundamental issue under Chapter 40B. You have to weigh the regional need for affordable housing against legitimate issues of local concern. A lot of the conditions and sort of provisions of a draft decision are programmatic. They address issues that occur in basically every Chapter 40B decision. So if you actually compare this draft decision to previously issued decisions by this Board, you will see a lot of conditions and findings and things of that nature that are repetitive. And you will also see a lot of things that are unique for this project. So the way that the decision is broken down is the first section we have, the procedural history. And that just sort of tries to lay out exactly what was submitted and sort of the circumstances that are generally in place at the time of the submittal. The second is the jurisdictional findings. So Chapter 40B has very unique requirements in order for an applicant to be eligible to file a comprehensive permit application. So this addresses those requirements. There are also a number of safe harbors that are available to a town. That's also addressed within these jurisdictional findings. And then we go to the factual findings. And these factual findings are obviously very project specific. And they try to address all of the different factual issues that have been brought up throughout the course of the hearing on the project. And they're broken down into different subsections. And then from there, we go to the conditions of the project. So these are the conditions that the board is imposing to make sure that the development is going to move forward in a way that again properly addresses legitimate issues of local concern. So the conditions are then further broken down into different sections. There's the general conditions. And these really are intended And these really are intended to address the issues to identify exactly what the plans are that are being approved. And from there, there's also some jurisdictional issues with regards to transfer of the permit and things of that nature. The second section is affordability. And those really are addressing programmatic issues under Chapter 40B. A lot of these are really within the exclusive jurisdiction of the subsidizing agency. However, it's very important for the board to make note of them in their decision so that they're not overlooked as the project moves forward. The third section is the submittal requirements. So Chapter 40B is unique in that it only requires the submittal of preliminary plans as part of the approval process before the board, which means then that the board has to include requirements for the submittal of final plans to make sure that what is actually ultimately put forth is consistent with what was reviewed and approved by the board. And these are very detailed in terms of what is required to be submitted for the final plans. There's all sorts of timing issues. Some things are required before the issuance of building permits. Some of them are required before the issuance of certificates of occupancy. So that's actually in Subsection D is construction completion slash certificate of occupancy. Subsection E, project design and construction. A lot of these are actually very general conditions that are applicable in any type of 40B development, and then you'll have a number of these conditions which are unique to this project. The next subsection, Subsection F, traffic safety concerns. And again, these are actually very unique to this project, and they come through the peer review process and the suggestions that were made by the peer review engineers. Subsection G, police, fire, and emergency medical conditions. This is again a mix of standard conditions and project-specific conditions having to do with police, fire, and other safety matters. Subsection H, water, sewer, and utilities. Subsection I, wetlands, floodplain, environmental conditions. These are actually much less significant on this project than they have been on other projects because we're not within any jurisdictional wetland areas. And then Subsection K, other general conditions. So these are catch-all conditions for the end of the process. And then the next section after that is the waiver decisions. And with the waiver decisions, what I've done is I've set forth what has been requested for waivers by the applicant. I've operated under the presumption that the board intends to approve this project, and therefore where waivers are necessary for the project to move forward, I presume that waiver is going to be granted. But again, that's ultimately for the board to decide, and these are only suggestions, and the board can act however they want on any of the specific waiver requests. So that lays out sort of the bare bones of the decision, and are there any questions?  I'll be happy to respond.

<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 63</summary>

> Great, thank you. That was an excellent summary. Thank you. All right, so if there are no questions, I'd like to give you a pregnant pause so you can have some if you want. Let's go to Ms. O'Connor, who can give us the applicant's reaction to the details that are for the particular things that are in the draft report. Ms. O'Connor.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 612</summary>

> Certainly. Thank you, Mr. Hanlon. Before I start, I just want to thank the board, Attorney Havarty and Mr. Reardon, for their diligent work on this application. So the Housing Corporation does thank you. With respect, I did send Mr. Hanlon and Mr. Havarty the comments of my client, which I'm not sure if they're going to be able to hear them, but I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you, Mr. Hanlon, and thank you, Mr. Havarty, and thank you, Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, Mr. Hanlon, and thank you, Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, Ms. O'Connor. Thank you, Mr. Havarty, and thank you, Ms. O'Connor. respect to the draft comprehensive permit. If you'd like me to go through them number by number, I can do that and I can give you the rationale for my client's position. Is that okay with you, Mr. Handler? I think that's fine. You should exercise some judgment as to whether everything needs to be done that way. Some of them may be just pure details that don't need to be. Correct, correct. On anything that is significant that we need to be focused in on that goes beyond what the bare bones of the paper that you submitted. I should say that I've asked Ms. Raulston to include that paper into the record. So we have an index of it and all of the members of the board and ultimately the public will see what those are. So it'll make... So you don't have to mention anything just because otherwise it'll get lost because at least the paper will be there. Okay, I would direct the board to procedural history number seven, where it says 60% affordability of area medium income. My client would like the flexibility for it to be up to 80%. As Ms. Schwartz testified during several of the hearings, there will be a range of area median incomes that are gonna be used at this project, but they wanna have that flexibility for this site. And that is addressed in several other places in the decision. With respect to number 26 on page five, which talks about long-term and short-term bicycle parking spaces, because of some concerns raised at the last hearing as to appropriate space in the garage and in other areas, what my client would like the decision to read is that rather than say 70 long-term bicycle parking spaces and 10 short-term, they'd like to say the project will provide at least 60 long-term and at least five short-term. The intention is to provide more, but they want to have that flexibility. Next. I just wanna point out that I believe that the request was for 21 parking spaces, Paul, and not 22, and that's correct. Yes, that's absolutely right. Okay. There's some other things that were in that, that as you know, you ended up, you corrected them months ago and submitted something for the record, so we'll get that straight. Okay. Now, one of the important things to discuss tonight is the issue of the waiver of fees, permitting fees and inspection fees. And that is page 13 of 28, number C2HI. Now, I believe, and I did provide Mr. Kline and Mr. Hanlon what the board did with respect to the Westminster project for the housing corporation. And they did waive 100% of all fees and inspection requirements with the exception of water and sewer permit fees. The housing corporation would be looking for the same type of waiver here. If the board members wanna reference that language that was included in that decision, that's at Middlesex South Registry of Deeds, book 67774, page 169A.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 44</summary>

> Now- Ms. O'Connor, could I stop you there for a minute? Sure. I'm wondering if, as you said, Mr. Kline has been working on this issue, and I wonder if he has anything that he can add to where we stand on that. Certainly.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Klein - 152</summary>

> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've been working with the town manager on this question, and he has been working with the department. We did receive confirmation this afternoon from the town that the town would be willing to offer the same waiver that they had on the Westminster project, where the town would waive the permit and review fees with the exception of the water and sewer connection fees. So, one thing I wanted to be clear is that we don't understand this request, but in any event, it's not what we, I don't think it's what the town is willing to do. We're not really talking about the costs of the safety details around the construction site and that sort of thing. These are the kinds of fees that were involved really in the Westminster project. The safety details were not involved, like police details, no, those were not waived. Yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 443</summary>

> Okay, so we can go back to the next one, I think, is B-4. The one immediately after the fees, that, just go back to the list. Sure. The next thing I have is D-2B. This is the section that talks about submitting the property management plan to the board. We thought some of the requirements that we submit were a little overreaching. For instance, pet policy, smoking policies, staffing. My client has no issue with respect to providing details as to building security, public access, trash removal, vegetation management, and the transportation management policies and procedures. We'd also want to point out that the plan could not be submitted to the zoning board until it is approved by the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities, which was formerly DHCD, because DHCD has to approve the plan as well. The next is E-8, and this is fairly significant. There was discussion at the very beginning of the permitting process that the project would be all electric with the exception of the hot water, which would be serviced by natural gas. Now, my client is proposing that the project will be designed to provide future electric domestication of hot water. But at this point, they are proposing that the project shall be all electric as to heating, ventilation, cooling, and appliances. The next item of concern is E-10. We want to make sure that we are only required to install underground the utilities we're bringing to the site, because I believe, and Nick can correct me if I'm not correct, that the cable is above ground. Correct, Nick? Yeah, all the utilities in the street are above ground, and I think we just wanted to acknowledge a small language change here to say that anything that's entering the site should be underground, but we're obviously not going to be taking municipal utility services and putting them underground within the public right-of-way. The next is E-13, which talks about the hours, which is totally appropriate of constricting construction. We'd like some language in there that if extraordinary circumstances are presented, that the applicant shall be entitled to request a waiver to perform work outside the hours by submitting a request to the director of planning, and I believe that there is precedent for this. We did this with respect to 1165-R. You may recall that when they were pouring the floors for the concrete, they needed continuous pours, and it couldn't be done within the hours. Concrete has to be wet and soft, and it was that type of situation, so they would look for that type of additional condition in there as well.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Klein - 154</summary>

> Mr. Chair, if I could just interject for a second. Yes. Apologies, Ms. O'Connor. So in E-13, the times that are listed currently, those would require a waiver already, which is not requested. The current town by-law is weekdays 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Okay. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and that's Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. So if we do want to, if these are the hours that are required, we would need to include a waiver to that effect. Okay. But if the, otherwise, if you're comfortable with what is currently in the town by-law's Title V, Section 12 on noise abatement, then we can, we don't need a waiver, but it would read 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. as opposed to 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. No, we would look for a waiver as written, the way the decision is written. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Just want to clarify that. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 44</summary>

> I have a question, Mr. Klein. What do you think, if Ms. O'Connor still has to give us a request for a waiver in order for us to act, do we have to keep the hearing open in time for her to do that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Klein - 36</summary>

> I think that, I mean, we have on some prior cases put forward waivers that were recognized as being required without a separate written request from the applicant. Mr. Havarty, does that make sense to you?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Havarty - 63</summary>

> Yeah, I mean, I think we should add this to the waiver list. And I'm happy to do that. We don't need the applicant to submit something formally. You know, they've made the request orally as part of this hearing, so we can add it to the list of waivers at the end of the decision. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Ms. O'Connor.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 170</summary>

> Next, F11. My client has no issue with respect to coordinating the repair of the sidewalk from Broadway to the project site, but it would like it to say at the town's expense. Because as Ms. Geller indicated at one of the hearings, DHCD does not allow money spent outside the project site. So they would not be in a position to do that. This is for the sidewalk between the site and Broadway?  Yes. With respect to G5, I don't necessarily know that there is access for the fire department personnel. We don't think for all four sides of the structure, but the fire chief has reviewed the plans and appears to be satisfied. So I think that if this is revised to say the project shall maintain access for fire department personnel as determined by the fire chief, that would be adequate. It is accessible from three sides at a minimum. I mean, that's fine with me. Ultimately, it's the fire department's call. Okay. Going to H5.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 14</summary>

> Sorry, Mary, did we want to touch on F12 briefly regarding the garage door?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 177</summary>

> Oh, yes. Well, Pat had said they have my list and they're aware of some of the things that are... The garage door is not going to be recessed. You may recall from the hearing that the neighbors do not want the garage door recessed. So that should be stricter. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. H5. We would like some language in there that the Department of Public Works will work with the applicant on permitting disconnects to facilitate the demolition of the existing building. I3, that would be deleted because there's no stormwater management system. And the same with K5. And those are my client's comments, except for the minor comments that I sent you in the memorandum with respect to parking spaces, number of charging stations and the like. They are in my memorandum to you. With respect to the waiver list- Before we go to the waiver list, are you saying that there is no stormwater management at all on the property? No, no stormwater management system, correct. No, there are. Paul, you're correct.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 150</summary>

> That's what I thought. I mean, it's small, right? But it's kind of critical that it gets installed properly and according to plan because what you don't want is you don't want a cross connection between the floor drains in the garage and the drainage system. So there is a modest drainage system. So I think it's probably prudent to keep that condition in there. Does that apply both to I3 and K5? I think it does. Again, it's not a huge obligation, but there is still a leaching catch basin and some minor stormwater improvements. And there's also swales around the building and the requirement that you can't discharge the abutting property. So it's not a heavy lift for the applicant, but it's important that it gets taken care of. Should we strike, in that same vein, should we strike the soil testing from it since we're not infiltrating?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 10</summary>

> I didn't see a condition for soil testing. Where's that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 117</summary>

> Didn't A6, this might be out of order, but I think A6 mentioned something about that that also referenced infiltration. I was about to maybe text Mary to say, is that this part of this that needs to be removed? Yeah, I don't see any compelling need to require any soil testing. The soil testing is E12. E12. Yep. Okay. Thank you. Gotta speak up sooner, Jeff. This actually does illustrate exactly what the purpose of this hearing is, right? Because if we easily could have gone over it and gotten it wrong, and we would never have been able to fix it if we didn't have all you people here to chat about it. So, Connor?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 182</summary>

> All right, so now I guess we're ready to move on to the waivers. All right. Paul, please note that the setback, the rear yard setback is 24 feet, not 20 feet. And there are just some points that I pointed out that it's the reparking requirements for the residential, one space per residential unit. It would be 44 spaces total with the commercial. We're talking 21 spaces. That's what we're looking for for a waiver. All right, where are we looking at in terms of the setback being 24 feet? Which waiver decision is that? Which, hold on a second. Two. Two. Minimum rear yard setback. So if the proposed is 24 and the minimum required is 20, is there a need for a waiver? No, no, no. So 24 is what's required in the recommendation of five. Okay. So it's 24 feet, not 20?  Yeah, it's 24 because it's 10 plus L over 10. It's a, Nick figured it out. Yeah, my eyes glazed over as soon as I saw that. Yeah, well, we're lawyers, not mathematicians, that's why.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 491</summary>

> Exactly. Mr. O'Connor, I have a question on parking. You're seeking, my understanding of the way in which the parking works is that there's an automatic 10% discount because this is affordable housing, which brings us down to 39-ish or something like that. And then the board has the discretion without waiving the bylaw at all, but a discretion under the bylaw to reduce the total amount of parking further down to 25% of that 39, which comes out to be about 10, which is well within the range that you need. But the catch is there has to be some sort of transportation demand management program, which is otherwise also already included in these conditions, which we haven't really addressed. And so I assume that you didn't object to. Now, obviously nobody is looking for the kind of transportation demand management that involves giving people free fare cards and having bus routes and so forth. But there are a bunch of things that could be useful that have to do with a number of transportation issues, some of which could be just pure demand management issues like providing literature about bus schedules, providing literature about how to get around Arlington and the neighboring jurisdictions using public transportation, which are the kinds of conditions that you've I'm sure seen in other cases and that we've used in other cases. There also is potentially some things that are related to demand management that have to do with, for example, notifying people that they're not supposed to park on the street or they're not in violation of the town rules, whatever the town rules may be at any given time. And it would be, I think that at least when I read what is already in Mr. Haverty's decision about demand management, if there's a package of essentially notification kinds of requirements like that, and that's what demand management means. And I assume that for right now, at least that's what I'm assuming that we would decide that it did mean whether informational type of requirements like that are problems that would pose great difficulties for the applicant, because it both would enable us to not give you a waiver, but rather to say under the bylaw, you don't need any more parking than you've got, which there's a good policy for not giving unnecessary waivers. And it also may give us the flexibility to address some of the other issues that neighbors have brought up having to do with parking and the number and that stay within what you guys have got control over, but provide at least some assurance to the neighborhood that some of the fears that they have may not materialize. So all of that is a long way of saying is that a sort of thing that poses a big problem for you or the sort of thing that you were kind of expecting was coming along anyway?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 101</summary>

> No, absolutely not. We were intending to do a very comprehensive transportation management plan along the lines that you suggested. And as you know, this isn't the first comprehensive permit. I believe we did one for Westminster and it'll include just what you spoke to. We cannot, you are prevented from the subsidy because these people are on subsidy for charging for parking. And the project is not in a position to give free MBTA cards and the like, but we will provide all of that information and we will have a very detailed transportation management plan. It is a non-issue.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 134</summary>

> Thank you. So I have another question that has to do with the town department of public works working with the applicant. on permitting disconnects to facilitate the demolition of the existing building. And I guess, Mike, what I'm looking for is if you can help me understand, or maybe Mr. Haverty can do this, there's something that is a little bit, I mean, you're here before us and are subject to the conditions that we impose, because that's what the conditions of the permit are, but the Town Department of Public Works isn't before us, and I'm not entirely sure why we have the jurisdiction to impose a condition requiring anything from them. I will give it to Mr. Gross-Handel to explain why we felt that was necessary from Bald Hill Builders. Matt?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Matt - 593</summary>

> Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm happy to do that. Which component are you asking about? This is about the demolition issue with the Department of Public Works. As far as the... Disconnect. Yeah, so really the question came down to timing. Certain municipalities will have moratoriums around doing work after November 15th and before April 15th for plowing reasons and so on. So I just want to make sure that we're working in concert with the DPW and the varying departments just to make sure we're aligned, based on when the project gets going and so on. That's topic one. So the topic one will be around... Sometimes what we may be asked to do when we go to do a disconnect to the existing building is we can... If it does occur in, let's say, I'll make it up December or January, if we're in a plow season, sometimes they can make a special exemption to allow us to do a disconnect in the roadway. Other times they'll have us do the disconnect under the sidewalk. Again, I just want to make sure we're aligned in our expectations. The second part to this, and this is really just boots on the ground as I went out recently to this site, I could see that the DPW or somebody's done recent road work out there. There's binder course down in the roadway now. There's exposed cast iron structures and so on. So clearly, there's going to be a finished top coat that happens at some point. Ideally, I'd like to work in concert with the paving operations for the new work so that we're not having to saw cut into brand new roadways and have to repair brand new roadways. If there's some way that we can work in an aligned methodology, we can make sure that our work is done prior to the top coat going down. Mr. Havity, I think I'm understanding more or less why it is that the public works department or the applicant needs that cooperation. But I'm a little bit unclear about what mechanisms we have to require or otherwise induce the public works department to cooperate. Again, board is acting in the stead of all local boards and commissions. If permits are required for these disconnects, then they're issued technically as part of the comprehensive permit process. But obviously, the board is going to want the input of the DPW. So I do think that what is being proposed here is appropriate. And I take it that the actual input from the DPW is something that occurs in the course of their working together at a later stage in the proceeding. We don't actually have to have the DPW in here saying that they've approved this or that. It's for later on. Okay, thank you. The only other comment I have is that we're looking for a waiver, the number of compact parking spaces, 60% of the parking spaces to be sized for compact cars. And those are the applicant's concerns and comments on the comprehensive permit. Mary, if I may, there was also soil testing in C2J. So that's the comment about the soil testing and removing that. And the other one was comments about a NEPTE's SWP permit, which is required for land disturbances greater than one acre. Our lot is only 16,500 square feet. So thus, it's not required. I do think that the NEPTE's condition does say if necessary. It's generally how I have those conditions drafted. Oh, if necessary, okay. Thank you.

> So I did have some blanks that still need to be filled in that I was hoping to get from the applicants. I think since we were on the waivers, we can start there. Okay. Waiver number three. I did want to touch on that one in particular, Mary and Paul, if I could. I think we were curious about the structure of that and wondering if we could modify the language to basically say that we're seeking a waiver from the requirement. And the proposal is, you know, the plans that submitted would show a roof deck on the second floor of approximately 2,000 square feet and landscape areas at the ground floor. I mean, again, I'm happy however you want to structure it as long as it's identifying exactly what is proposed. So there's a requirement of a 10% minimum landscape and 20% minimum usable open space. What is being proposed instead of meeting those requirements? Nicky needs the percentages like from the procedure. My concern, Mary, is that there are specific prescriptive requirements within the zoning code that define what landscape area can constitute and what usable open space can constitute. And I don't think that the project is necessarily designed around 100% of those requirements. I think we've made a clear proposal to the board about what the character of the roof deck space will be and what the character of the plantings both along the streetscape on Sunnyside and around the three other sides of the site will be.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 50</summary>

> I think those are well documented in the submitted plans and in the landscape plan and the planting plan. So I would propose that the waiver be rewritten to say we're seeking a waiver from the 10% and 20% requirements and the proposal is to build the plans as submitted.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Klein - 309</summary>

> Mr. Chairman, I mean I think it would be appropriate for the applicant if those percentages are 0%. Let's put in 0% but then also indicate that in lieu of providing the acknowledge also in the waiver request that the applicant is providing an alternative means of providing outdoor space and landscape space that it is and do it that way. But I think it's important that we do have an acknowledgement that there's a specific request there's a specific request being made and it's not sort of as open-ended as saying well we're doing something different. Right from my perspective it's always better to be very specific as to what the proposal is for the waiver so that the board if there's ever an appeal of a decision I like the board to be able to be a point to their waiver decisions and say we were cognizant of exactly you know the the extent of the waiver that was being granted and it's in our decision. Otherwise you know it renders the board vulnerable to a claim that they've been acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner. So I'm a little bit unclear Mr. Burens as to I mean everybody always wants as much flexibility as they can have but you do have a fairly specific proposal before. We do yeah and I guess you know if there was a request to try to tabulate what those specific percentages would be based on the strict reading of the bylaws we're happy to do that. It just seemed more straightforward to say we've made a very specific proposal to you we'd like you know the waiver to grant us the ability to build what's been proposed and what you've reviewed right. Well they are talking about granting it but they want the percentages. I think that's the answer.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 323</summary>

> Yeah I mean I you know if Mr. Klein's suggestion of saying zero and zero but we're choosing an alternative compliance path and the board agrees that this is a valid path that seems perfectly fine to me. I think I think the problem is is that when we write the opinion we're going to want to have a specific enough description of the alternative compliance path that it's clear to everyone that we know what it is that we were buying into. And yeah I mean it seemed like there was a precedent for this type of approach in waiver number one for example where you know as we all know there's a requirement you know in the bylaws to provide a step back at a certain amount and a certain depth on the building. We've proposed a slightly alternative design it's not zero but it's something and that's documented in the approved plans and that's the way that the waiver is written right. So the way the waiver requested number one the applicant requests a waiver to allow no stepping back as shown on the approved plans. But there is stepping back on the approved plans is my point right. So the plans are approved with a step back at the fifth floor of a lesser dimension right. So that's I think an analogous situation where we're proposing something that you know is different than the requirement. That's why we requested a waiver and we've documented it with the plans that are you know submitted and approved. Nick you can tabulate the numbers correct? Yes we can we can take a pass at tabulating the numbers that's fine. All right we will get you the numbers. And the board can always in the board action where it's stating that the waiver is granted we can also reference the approved plans as a way of proceeding. I think that would be helpful.

> All right waiver number seven. The applicant requests a waiver to allow a reduction the drive aisle requirement to and I don't know how many feet. 22 feet was discussed at the last hearing. 22? Yeah yes. Then I know there were some blanks at the beginning. Of the decision with regards to impervious area. With number five. Number five property contains significant pavement covering approximately blank percent of the property. It was 100% I believe isn't that right Nick? I think Jeff had that number it's slightly less than 190 something I'm looking for it right now. Do you know? I'm looking it up as well. 95.9 I believe you said and with a reduction to 89.49. 89.49 yep. So 95.9? Yep. The reduction is to 89.49. Yep. Mr. Reardon I just you commented a little bit on that too. Those numbers ring true to you as well? They do. I just have an issue with significant digits so. Okay just to the 10th please. Fair enough. Not to the 100th. I got it. It brings back eighth grade. And I think that's allowing me more digits than we're allowed but you know. 100th is just hard for me to. Okay got it. All right Mr. Avedy you have some other things?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Avedy - 48</summary>

> So I'm just trying to say I know that there was. Do you have number six of the waiver? It's Paul Paul 60% of the parking space is to be sized for compact. Yes I got that from what you sent in. All right. I think that covers.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 285</summary>

> Oh no number 27. Just proximity to the nearest MBTA bus stop. I mean I guess the board could provide that as well if you're aware. Yeah so Broadway at Sunnyside Ave is the one that's on their side of the street and Broadway opposite Sunnyside Ave is on the opposite side of the street. They're served by the 87 bus. Bus route 87? 87. All right. And Christian you can give me that. Yep absolutely. So without other things I mean it seems to me that it's important here. The 87 isn't the only bus that stops nearby at least subject to the snow problem that some of the neighbors have pointed out to. Going to Clarendon Hill gives you what two more bus lines and going to both the Green Line if I'm not mistaken and certainly to Davis Square. So you know you're really in a the Sunnyside is really kind of only a part of the transit friendliness of this project. Paul and I just want to point out that it's one space per dwelling unit not 1.5. There was a revised waiver list. Yep no I got that from your suggested changes. So I think that is all of the missing information that I have. On the project plans can you just give me the revision date? So dated March 9, 2023 with revisions through. I just need to know what that date is. Nick I'd have to rely on for that. So I think I guess my question would be we've submitted a lot of supplementary material at the hearings over the last couple months. Should those be counted as the revisions and we establish the date that way?
</details>

Some plans have been revised some have not but there's I think a record of information that's been recorded so. I guess he's asking for your guidance as to how you want to date that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 278</summary>

> Go with whatever plans are submitted with the most recent revision date. I don't want to put on a date that's not actually shown on a set of plans. Okay. The revised date on the Sammy Otis plans is August 1st. Thanks Jeff. And Paul you just typically reference the approved plans. The other material that Nick references is just factual basis for the board to make a decision on not necessarily. Correct. Okay Mr. Conner I have a question having to do with the hot water. Yes I'm if in in the language that you've suggested it almost is a requirement that you use gas for hot water and I don't know how long it'll take you to actually get your financing and build this up but that may or may not be what you want to do at that point. I gather what what you're looking for here is is something that says you know something more like it like gas or electric something more like it like gas or electric because if if it were appropriate you do electric and you just think that that won't that won't be the case at that point but you're not going to want to be have someone say you're not going to want to show up to Mr. Champa and say well look I want to do electric and he says no your permit says you have to do gas that presumably around that. Yeah that's not the intention the intention is that we not be locked into doing electric that we have the option at this point to do gas. Right that's what I would have assumed.

> Mr. Chair to have a very minor notation in throughout the decision the architecture firm is sometimes really referred to as Utah architecture and sometimes it's Utah architecture and urban design. I just wanted to ask which is the correct legal name? Our correct legal name is UTL Inc. UTL Inc. Okay. So going through the decision a little further on E29 we've got a reference to diagrams showing the turning paths but I don't know who they were prepared by or what their dates were. I don't think that was provided Paul I think that's a holdover from the prior language. Okay so we never got truck path diagrams? We did I don't believe we have anything related to CMP at this point. Okay. I would just ask the applicant to confirm that. That's correct we hasn't provided from San Marcos. Okay yeah Paul I don't know if that that was like condition that typically refers to like fire truck turning plans which in this in this case we don't have because the only access is from Sunnyside. There's no navigation through the site by a fire truck. Okay this is for construction vehicles. Mr. Conner?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 226</summary>

> Yes. E30 says that the applicant shall hire a licensed pest control company to conduct a comprehensive assessment of pest activity on the property and then develop and implement an integrated test pest management plan for all phases of the project before construction during construction post-occupancy. The use of second generation anti-coagulant rodenticides is prohibited. That I think we used in the most recent other 40b that preceded this one and it's it's a matter of some significance as you know given given what's going on in the town right now and I wanted to make sure you focused on that and that you have no problems with that. No issues ball till builders will take care of that we have no issue with respect to the restriction on the pesticide. And you have no you think the it also says and it holds. different subject, that construction vehicles will all be parked on site. I actually don't have that in front of me, so that wasn't an exact quote, but in terms of making sure that the vehicles from the construction workers as well as the, are not sort of parked all the way on the neighborhood streets, and I take it that that is a condition that you have no objection to. Well, I'm going to refer that to Mr. Grosshammer, whether that's accomplishable.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 153</summary>

> Thank you. One of the comments that came up in one of the earlier hearings had to do with no parking on the Michael Street, and I suggested at the time that we'd be willing or amenable to accommodating that. There is public parking and meter parking available on some of the cross streets. We'd like to have access to that. We are also looking into negotiating some larger scale rental and or arrangements with some of the abutters to use some parking. So the intent is to try to minimize the amount of on-street parking, but we would do so in a legal and appropriate manner. But I take it that you still don't have any objection to something that requires you to notice that your parking crews are not allowed to park on Michael Street. That's something that would matter a lot to the neighborhood. Yes, that's something we've consented to.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 182</summary>

> Thank you. And I take it that there's another thing that isn't really described in here in the same detail that I thought, but Mr. Conner, earlier you described something about the kind of meetings or the communications with the public during the course of construction to let people know what's going on. And I guess I have two questions about that. One question is we don't currently have something that really is developed in the way that you've described. We do have a precedent in the 1165 case, and we do have, and I'm sure I can go back and find your recording where you describe what you had in mind, which I think was a little more generous than that. And I guess I'd like to ask whether as part of the community that would be within that protection, that it would be all the residents of Michael Street. Would that make sense? I think it would make sense. And frankly, anyone that would provide an email in that area could certainly receive those notifications from Bald Hill Builders. Great.

So two day one and five in the future. Okay. Okay, thank you.

It's four. It's two charging stations with two each on it. So four parking spaces will have access. Correct, right, Nick? It's two charging stations with two parking spaces. Yeah, that is correct. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Are there any other questions that the member of the board wishes to bring up right now?

> Mr. Chair. Mr. Klein. Condition H6, which is the applicant should be responsible for all trash recycling yard waste removal from the property. The town shall not have any responsibility. I just want to confirm with the applicant that that's correct. My client had no issue with that. Is that correct, Erica? I'm not looking at it right now. This is H6 removal, snow removal. What was it? Trash recycling and yard waste removal. The town shall have no responsibility for those. The applicant will be responsible for the costs associated and organizing it. Okay. Erica, go ahead.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Erica - 211</summary>

> Yes, we use private pickup at our other larger sites. So I assume we're not going to rely on town trash collection. Yeah. And then, yes, certainly snow removal. And then also, going down to I4, which has to do with fertilization, fertilizer and things like that. Are there any areas that are, that would have a lawn at this time? I don't think there are. I just wanted to confirm that. No. Okay. Yeah, I don't think we'll be fertilizing. Okay. So essentially, what we would be striking is basically everything except for the last two sentences. So it would just read that the application of plant nutrients shall comply with 330 CMR 31. No other herbicides or treatment methods are approved. Correct. We'll just leave it at that. Okay, perfect. Thank you. I just wanted to check that. Mr. Heberty, I wonder if you could, I'm hurriedly looking through to find the right paragraph, but you'll tell me quicker. There's provision about what to do about snow and particularly what to happen if there's not enough room to put it on the site. And I wonder if you could remind us what that provision is so that we can be sure that the applicant is in agreement with it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mary Winstanley O'Connor - 119</summary>

> I can run through and find it. Essentially, it generally is that if there are not sufficient snow storage areas on site, then they will have to remove snow and truck it off site. Purely by accident, I opened it up to E18, which says snow may only be stored within the areas of the property designated for that purpose on the approved plans. To the extent snowfall exceeds the capacity of the designated snow storage area, the applicant shall truck the excess snow off site. Snow may not be placed in or adjacent to resource areas. And I take it that that is something that doesn't cause a problem to the applicant? It did not for my client.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 457</summary>

> Okay. Are there any other questions from the board? Seeing none, this is a public hearing. We're all kind of at this point familiar as to what that means. Before we open up to public comment, I wanted to review some ground rules for effective and clear contact of tonight's business. Public questions and comment will only be taken as it relates to the matter at hand, which at this point is practically everything, and should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing our decision. In all probability, this will be the last session of the public hearing, and our focus will be on what the board should do to address the various concerns that have been expressed. Members of the public should keep in mind that we will not be able to receive any new information from the applicant or anyone else after this hearing formally closes. The chair will first ask members of the public who've logged in through Zoom and wish to speak digitally raise their hands using the Raise Hand button in the Participants tab in the Zoom application. You'll be called upon by the meeting host, after which you may unmute yourself. And for those calling in by phone, please dial 9. And again, you'll be called on by the meeting host. Please begin your comments by giving your name and address for the record. You will then be given up to five minutes for your questions and comments. All questions are to be addressed through the chair. Remember to speak clearly, concisely, and in a way that helps generate an accurate record of the meeting. Once all public questions and comments have been addressed, or if we've reached the hour, I'm just going to arbitrarily say 9.30, although I don't know that we'll go that far. The public comment period for this evening's session will be closed. The board, the applicant, and staff, which ultimately means the indefatigable Ms. Ralston, will do our best to show the documents being discussed. If you'd like a specific document to be displayed during your comment, please ask us to do so, and we'll do our best to accommodate. So that said, we'll open the public comment hearing and ask if there's anyone who would like to address this application. I'm not seeing any hands. Going once, going twice, going three times. I don't know that it makes much sense to go back and ask the board if they have something more, since they just passed on the opportunity. Before we do that, Karina Liendo has put her hand up, and she didn't really make it before going three times, probably, but I'm not going to be strict about that. Ms. Liendo?

<details><summary>	 Roberto Costa - 183</summary>

> This is actually her husband, Roberto Costa. I still think the project is too big for the area. I still think there are way too many waivers for the building to fit in the footprint that it should fit. I understand there are economic concerns for that in a state that has a surplus budget and can afford quality housing. I think that should be the priority. I don't think that should drive something as permanent as a five-story building in the area. I still have concerns about forcing everybody to bike. Arlington, I think, will deprive the citizens to access to the town by forcing them to be on a bike. There are not enough bike lanes, and I guess when I've been most down in my life is when I most needed a car to get to places on time. Public transportation is not reliable, and you can also have a second income, a gig economy in Uber or something else. I still think you're going to need more parking space than is required there. Those are my comments. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 27</summary>

</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Klein - 329</summary>

> Thank you. I just wanted to acknowledge that the board is in receipt of a letter by the concerned citizens of Michael Street, which raises many important points that they have brought forward on a lot of the prior hearings. I think it's important that the board look at those, and specifically they have some requests and suggestions. I think a lot of those have made their way into what we're looking at now. They were looking to include the residents of Michael Street in the neighborhood construction update, which Ms. O'Connor has said they can easily accommodate, looking to prevent contractor parking on Michael Street. The contractor has stated that they would be willing to do that. They had concerns about using Rodenticide, and that's included now in the conditions. There was a question, could the HCA commit in writing that in the future overnight street parking permit stickers will not be issued to allow 10 Sunnyside residents to park on Michael Street? That is currently not allowed under the town bylaws is my understanding, so I don't think that's something that falls within our purview. And similarly, making Michael Street one way towards Sunnyside, that is solely within the discretion of the select board, and is not something that the ZBA is allowed to address. And there were two other suggestions they had, which had to do with the size of the building. And I think we've discussed several times the issues about the size of the building and the economic considerations that go into that, and that the size of the building is currently allowed by zoning. So as far as the height is concerned, not the setbacks. So just wanted to address that letter, because I appreciate the effort that the residents went through to put that together, and to provide that commentary to us. And I did want to acknowledge that we are cognizant of that, we are taking much of that into consideration.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 243</summary>

> Mr. Clyde, you may well notice that the last several questions I was asking to the applicant all really came from that letter. There's one other concern that's expressed in that letter that is not something that I think that the applicant can directly handle, but I would like to understand a little bit better what the possibilities are, and whether there's any kind of action that the board could take that would be constructive. One of the things that's come up over and over in the hearing is that during the winter, the snow is not cleared off the space that goes between Sunnyside and Broadway. And since I walk that frequently, I can attest that that is certainly the case. I'm not quite sure who exactly is the agency, but I'm sure it's a public agency that's responsible for the snow removal. And obviously the residents here who, after the 87 isn't running, or if they're going in a place the 87 doesn't go, might want to go to Clarendon Hill, it's an obstacle. And if you walk into the street, as many people, including me, do, it's not entirely safe either, especially when it's snowy and icy outside. So does anyone have an understanding that's better than I do as to what it is that could actually be accomplished for the safety of the people who live here and to improve the safety of the people who already live here?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Pat Hanlon - 194</summary>

> I think that might be a question we would need to address to the DPW as to who has jurisdiction over that area of sidewalk. There are, as we've just seen, there are several, there are lots of issues that are involved in this site where the applicant doesn't really have any control over that. Either the select board, if it has to do with parking, or possibly with the street, is who you'd have to turn to. And often on these issues like the snow, the applicant and the residents of this property and the residents of the neighborhood have the same interest, they're not really conflicting. If the board has any ability to, as we think through those things and the things that are outside our peer view, to note them or at least to provide some way of communicating to the rest of the town that there are issues here that need to be addressed, we might want to consider doing that. So there's one other late speaker and then I think that it's going to be time for us to move over, but Ms. Broder has her hand up now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ms. Broder - 335</summary>

> Thank you. You'd think after three years of this I could figure out how to raise my hand in a timely manner, but that's not the case. First, just a sincere gratitude and appreciation for all of the hard work that this applicant has put toward all of these hearings. Being on the design side professionally, I understand what that means. And I really appreciate it. I think they have been responsive to many things as the designs have evolved. Like Roberto before me, I will continue with my position that the building is outsized for the site and that paving 89% of a site adjacent to a brook in one of the few urban wilds we have is not a good idea. But I see where this process is going and so it is what it is. Today something came up that I hadn't seen before and I have been unable to find the draft decision online to view it myself, but the request to extend construction hours to earlier in the morning, six or seven days a week, I would strongly suggest that the board does not allow that. We're talking about the long-term impacts of the building size to all of the residents, but we're also talking about the short-term impacts to people far beyond the abutters with the noise of construction and there's a reason that we have that noise ordinance. So I strongly, strongly ask that no extension of construction periods be granted except for extenuating circumstances like the poor or, you know, etc. So that was it. Thank you all for your work and especially also to the board for all of their diligent work and for their real, I think the effort they've made to bring forward all of the residents' comments and to take them seriously and it means a lot to be able to participate in this process and see that it's not just, that it's meaningful and it's taken seriously. So thank you very much.

</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Klein - 115</summary>

> Mr. Chairman? Mr. Klein? Just to the previous speaker's concerns, the current town bylaw allows for construction Monday through Friday 8 to 6 and then 9 to 5 on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. And what the board has typically done, when requested to extend the hours, we extend at 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on Saturdays and then disallow any construction activities on Sundays and legal holidays. And so I do appreciate that, you know, it does sort of start the construction earlier, but it does guarantee that there's at least one day a week when there is no construction activity on-site.

If there's nothing more, we're now at the point of deciding on closing the hearing. We've been at this for a long time. Closing the hearing will be important because it will mean that we're then sort of like a ballistic missile. We've been shot off and where we land is already determined by where we've already been. At this point, the chair would entertain a motion. Mr. Haverty, you should correct me if this is not exactly the right motion to make, but would entertain a motion to close the public hearing in this case and to schedule the first day of our deliberations for September the 5th, 2023 at 730. Mr. Haverty, is that satisfactory? Absolutely, yes. So moved, Mr. Chair. This is moved by Mr. Klein, seconded by Mr. DuPont. Let's go through the roll. Mr. Klein? Aye. Mr. DuPont?  Aye. Mr. Ricardelli? Aye. Mr. Holy? Aye. Ms. Hoffman?  Aye. Mr. LeBlanc? Aye. And the chair votes aye. So the public hearing in this case is now closed after a number of months.

> The deliberation period will begin. I will say that I echo Ms. Broder in thanking the applicant for their cooperation. They certainly are showing themselves. They are about to be residents in this neighborhood, just like the other people who appeared before us, and I'm hoping that by the time we all get together to celebrate the first anniversary of this, it will be a kumbaya moment. I also very much appreciate the effort made by Mr. Haverty, who's still got plenty of effort left to make, and Mr. Reardon, who has been terrific at providing us with the peer review advice that we've met, and appreciative of all the members of the board and all of their families who are putting up with a lot, and I'm looking forward to doing the deliberations and to seeing all of you, even if I can't necessarily hear all of you for the rest of the information. So with that, the chair would entertain a motion to adjourn. So moved, Mr. Chair. Moved by Mr. Klein. Seconded by Mr. DuPont. We'll go through the roll. Mr. Klein? Aye. Mr. DuPont?  Aye. Mr. Ricardelli? Aye. Ms. Holy? Aye. Excuse me, that was Mr. Holy. And Ms. Hoffman? Aye. And Adam, Mr. Blank? Mr. LeBlanc?  Aye. And the acting chair votes aye, so he can stop acting and turn it back over to the regular chair later. All right, thank you all very much. It's been a pleasure. Bye-bye.
