> The Zoning Board of Appeals meeting, chaired by Pat Hanlon, discussed a proposed project at 10 Sunnyside Avenue. The board confirmed the presence of all members and officials, including Christian Klein, Roger DuPont, Daniel Ricardelli, Venkat Holi, Elaine Hoffman, Adam LeBlanc, and administrative assistant Colleen Ralston. The board also approved minutes from previous meetings and approved final decisions on two other dockets. The main focus of the meeting was to review the draft decision for the 10 Sunnyside Avenue project, prepared by Paul Haverty. The board discussed various aspects of the project, including construction hours, building size, parking, and snow removal. The board also addressed a letter from concerned citizens of Michael Street. The public hearing for the project was closed, and deliberations were scheduled to begin on September 5th, 2023. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn.
</details><details><summary>What were the final votes for the 18 Robinhood Road and the 14 Oakland Ave projects?</summary>

> The final vote for the 18 Robinhood Road project was approved with four votes in favor (from Mr. DuPont, Mr. Ricardelli, Mr. Holi, Mr. LeBlanc, and the Chair) and two members (Mr. Klein and Ms. Hoffman) abstaining due to not being present at the hearing. The 14 Oakland Ave project was also approved with four votes in favor (from Mr. DuPont, Mr. Ricardelli, Mr. Holi, and Mr. LeBlanc) and one member (Mr. Klein) abstaining due to not being present at the hearing. Ms. Hoffman was present for the first night of the hearing but not the second, so her position was not recorded in the final vote.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Mr. Haverty's report for the comprehensive permit.</summary>

> Mr. Haverty provided a detailed overview of the draft decision for the comprehensive permit. He explained that the Board of Appeals is the permit granting authority for all local approvals necessary for the project to move forward. He outlined the three possible outcomes of a decision: approval as submitted, approval with conditions, or denial. In this case, the draft decision presumes approval with conditions. He then broke down the structure of the decision, which includes the procedural history, jurisdictional findings, factual findings, and conditions of the project. The conditions are further divided into sections such as general conditions, affordability, submittal requirements, construction completion, project design and construction, traffic safety concerns, police, fire, and emergency medical conditions, water, sewer, and utilities, wetlands, floodplain, environmental conditions, and other general conditions. The decision also includes a section on waiver decisions.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Mary Winstanley O'Connor's response to Haverty's report.</summary>

> Mary Winstanley O'Connor, the lawyer representing the applicant, responded to Haverty's report by addressing several points. She agreed with the proposed conditions regarding the construction hours, trash removal, and snow removal. She confirmed that the applicant would be responsible for all trash, recycling, and yard waste removal from the property, and that if snowfall exceeds the capacity of the designated snow storage area, the applicant would truck the excess snow off-site. She also clarified that there would be no areas with a lawn on the property, so the application of plant nutrients would comply with 330 CMR 31. Regarding parking, she stated that the applicant would try to minimize on-street parking and was considering larger scale rental arrangements with some of the abutters for parking. She also agreed to a condition requiring the applicant to notify their construction crews not to park on Michael Street.

</details><details><summary>What was the issue surrounding snow removal and the town's responsibility?</summary>

> The issue surrounding snow removal was about who would be responsible for it. The applicant confirmed that they would be responsible for all trash, recycling, yard waste, and snow removal from the property, and the town would not have any responsibility for these tasks. If the snowfall exceeds the capacity of the designated snow storage area, the applicant would have to truck the excess snow off-site. The snow could not be placed in or adjacent to resource areas.
</details><details><summary>What is the reliance on public transportation for the residents of 10 Sunnyside Ave?</summary>

> The residents of 10 Sunnyside Ave have access to multiple public transportation options. The Broadway at Sunnyside Ave bus stop, which is on their side of the street, and the Broadway opposite Sunnyside Ave bus stop, on the opposite side of the street, are both served by the 87 bus route. Additionally, going to Clarendon Hill provides access to two more bus lines and to both the Green Line and Davis Square. Therefore, the residents have a significant reliance on public transportation.

</details><details><summary>What other conditions were required for the comprehensive permit?</summary>

> The comprehensive permit required several conditions. These included the submission of final plans to ensure consistency with what was reviewed and approved by the board, the provision of detailed information on building security, public access, trash removal, vegetation management, and transportation management policies and procedures, and the installation of utilities entering the site underground. The project was also required to be all electric as to heating, ventilation, cooling, and appliances, with the exception of hot water, which would be serviced by natural gas.

</details><details><summary>Which members of the public spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting?  What were their concerns?</summary>

> Two members of the public spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting. The first was Roberto Costa, who expressed concerns about the size of the project, the number of waivers for the building, and the potential impact on transportation in the area, particularly for those who rely on cars. He also raised concerns about the lack of sufficient parking space. The second speaker was a woman named Ms. Broder. She also expressed concerns about the size of the building and its potential environmental impact, particularly given its proximity to a brook. She also strongly objected to the proposal to extend construction hours, citing the potential noise disruption for residents.
