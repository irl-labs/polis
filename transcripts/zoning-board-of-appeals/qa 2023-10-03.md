<details><summary>Please, summarize the Zoning Board of Appeals Meeting.</summary>

> The Zoning Board of Appeals meeting, chaired by Christian Klein, was held on October 3rd, 2023. The meeting began with a roll call to confirm the presence of all members and officials. The board then proceeded to discuss various dockets, including properties at 32 Appleton Street, 5 Mystic Lake Drive, 77 Tanager Street, 212 Pleasant Street, 106 Mount Vernon Street, and 15 Moccasin Path. The board also discussed the approval of decisions for 148 Mount Vernon Street and 56 Newcomer Street. The meeting was conducted remotely in accordance with an act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2023. The board acknowledged that the town of Arlington is located on the ancestral lands of the Massachusetts tribe. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detail explanation of the appeal Carl Toumayan made on behalf of the owners of 106 Mount Vernon Street.</summary>

> Carl Toumayan, representing the owners of 106 Mount Vernon Street, appealed the issuance of a building permit for a property on Mount Vernon Street. The appeal was based on two main points. The first was the timeliness of the appeal. Toumayan argued that the appeal was filed within the 30-day window from when the appellants received actual notice of the permit. He claimed that the appellants did not receive actual notice until July 7th, when the permit was uploaded to the town's online permitting system. The second point was the adequacy of the notice given to the appellants. Toumayan argued that the town had an obligation to notify the appellants when the permit was issued, as they had specifically requested to be informed. He claimed that the town failed to provide adequate notice, which he argued should have been a direct and explicit notification.

> The text does not provide information on why Building Inspector Mike Ciampa denied the extension for the permit for 106 Mount Vernon Street.
</details><details><summary>What were the recommendations of Town counsel Michael Cunningham in regards to the appeal for 106 Mount Vernon St?</summary>

> Town counsel Michael Cunningham recommended that the board first determine whether the appeal was filed in a timely manner. He noted that the appeal was filed on August 1, 2023, which is more than 30 days after the building permit was issued on June 26, 2023. He also pointed out that the appellants had been aware of the permit application and had been in contact with the Inspectional Services Department. Cunningham suggested that the board could find that the appellants had received adequate notice of the permit issuance. He also mentioned that if the board determines the appeal was not timely, the cleanest way to deal with the appeal would be to make no further inquiry.
</details><details><summary>What did the board decide and vote for in regards to the appeal for 106 Mount Vernon St?</summary>

> The board did not make a decision or vote on the appeal for 106 Mount Vernon St in the provided text. The discussion was focused on the timeliness of the appeal and whether the appellants had received adequate notice of the building permit being issued. The board decided to address these preliminary procedural issues before moving on to the merits of the case.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the project at 32 Appleton St.</summary>

> The project at 32 Appleton Street involves the applicant, Jenna Francis, seeking to open a massage therapy business in her home. The business would be a therapeutic practice, serving one client at a time, with a focus on medical massage for clients recovering from or preparing for surgeries, or dealing with various nerve disorders. The business would not cause parking issues as there is sufficient space in the driveway for client parking. The Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals considered this as a home occupation, which requires a special permit if customers are served on the premises. The board found that the requested use is allowed by special permit, would be desirable to the public, would not create undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety, would not overload any public system, would not impair the character or integrity of the neighborhood, would not be detrimental to the public health or welfare, and would not cause an excess of use detrimental to the neighborhood.
</details><details><summary>Summarize the Board discussion concerning the pilot project to ban fossil fuels.</summary>

> The Board discussed the pilot project to ban fossil fuels, with Mr. Hanlon asking for clarification on whether the ban would also cover additional propane tanks in the front yard that feed a furnace in a house on new construction. The response was that if the propane is actually heating the house, it might not qualify under the ban, but this would need to be checked against the statute. The Board also discussed how the ban fits into the enforcement mechanisms of the stretch code and the specialized town has also bought in. The Board mentioned that Talia Fox has a memorandum relating to the fossil fuel project that carefully parses out where they're the same and where they're a little different from the bylaw that was already adopted.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the project at 5 Mystic Drive.</summary>

> The project at 5 Mystic Drive involves the redevelopment of a single-family home into a two-family home in an R2 zoning district. The main issue discussed was the addition of a second driveway. The applicant consulted with the Conservation Commission and David Morgan, who indicated that he had some discretion to allow an additional two feet for the length of the driveway. A traffic study was conducted, which indicated that the proposed second driveway would not pose any safety concerns due to low traffic volumes and anticipated vehicle speeds on Mystic Lake Drive. The applicant also addressed concerns about the preservation of trees on the property, stating that there would be a shifting of obligation to the client to continue with a tree expert company to preserve the trees. The applicant also mentioned that they were open to installing bollards to protect a mechanical piece of equipment located in the roadway if the board deemed it necessary.
</details><details><summary>Please, list and summarize each speaker's comments limited to the 5 Mystic Drive project.</summary>

> 1. Attorney Nessie: Representing the client, he discussed the changes made to the project since the last meeting, including a meeting with the tree warden and the creation of a tree plan. He also mentioned the traffic study and the approval from the Conservation Commission.

2. Mr. Mahoney: As the client, he expressed his commitment to working with the community and following all necessary regulations. He also mentioned his willingness to address any concerns about the mechanical equipment in the roadway.

3. Mr. DiLorenzo and Ms. O'Connell: As neighbors, they expressed concerns about the traffic study's findings, stating that the street is not always quiet and can sometimes be a pass-through street with aggressive driving. They suggested designating the street as a residence-only street.

4. Mr. McLaughlin: Another neighbor, he echoed the concerns about traffic and suggested the addition of a children's zone or cautionary sign to alert drivers to the presence of children in the area.

5. Mr. Hanlon: A board member, he suggested that the board should focus on the issue of the second driveway and whether it meets the necessary criteria, rather than getting into conservation issues. He also suggested that the board should find that the project does not create an undue concentration of population, allows adequate provision of transportation, and conserves the value of land and buildings in the vicinity.

6. Mr. Moore: Another board member, he suggested that those with traffic concerns should reach out to the select board and the transportation advisory committee. He also noted that the streets are outside of the board's jurisdiction.

</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the project at 77 Tanager St.</summary>

> The project at 77 Tanager St. involves replacing an existing one-car garage with a two-car garage and adding a master bedroom suite. The addition is in compliance with all setback requirements. The reason for the hearing is due to the size of the addition exceeding 750 square feet, as per section 5.4.2b6. The applicant also discussed plans for preserving existing trees on the property, with ongoing arrangements with a tree expert company to ensure the viability of the trees. The applicant also addressed concerns about the length of the driveway, stating that they have been granted an additional two feet for the driveway length. The project was approved by the board with four stated conditions.
</details><details><summary>Please, list and summarize each speaker's comments limited to the 77 Tanager St project.</summary>

> 1. The applicant, Bill Nolan from Savoy Nolan Architects, presented the project on behalf of the owners, Scott and Chelsea Weir. He explained that the project involves replacing an existing one-car garage with a two-car garage and adding a master bedroom suite. He confirmed that the addition is conforming to all setback requirements and the reason for the special permit request is due to the size of the addition exceeding 750 square feet.

2. Mr. Hanlon raised a question about the application of section 5.7 of the bylaw, which pertains to the wetlands protection zone. He suggested that the board's decision on the driveway should not imply any judgment on whether this section applies.

3. The chair clarified that the Director of Inspectional Services did not believe section 5.7 was applicable because the area of the building was outside of the floodplain and had been approved by the conservation commission.

4. The chair also noted that the board would need to make three findings to approve the second driveway: that it does not create an undue concentration of population, does not interfere with the flow of traffic, and does not detrimentally impact the value of land and buildings in the vicinity.

5. Mr. Hanlon moved that the board approve the application subject to the three standard conditions and an additional condition requiring the applicant to provide revised dimensional and parking information and open space gross floor area sheets.

6. The motion was seconded by Mr. DuPont and approved by the board.
</details><details><summary>What conditions did the Board require for the 77 Tanager St. project?</summary>

> The Board required four conditions for the 77 Tanager St. project. The first three were standard conditions that were previously read into the record. The fourth condition was that the applicant is to provide revised dimensional and parking information and open space gross floor area sheets correcting any deficiencies discussed at the hearing.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the project at 15 Moccasin Path as presented by Bill Nolan.</summary>

> Bill Nolan, representing the owners of 15 Moccasin Path, Scott and Chelsea Weir, presented a proposal for a home addition. The existing house is a one and a half story cape with a single car garage. The proposed addition includes replacing the existing one car garage with a two car garage and adding a master bedroom suite. The addition is in compliance with all setback requirements. The reason for the application is due to the size of the addition, which exceeds 750 square feet, requiring a special permit under section 5.4.2b6. The addition was presented as being in harmony with the neighborhood and received support from neighbors. The board approved the special permit for the addition with three standard conditions.
