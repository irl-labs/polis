<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 7.33pm on Tuesday, January 9th, 2024. Happy New Year, everyone. Good evening. My name is Christian Klein. I am the chair of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals, and I'm calling this meeting of the board to order. I'd like to confirm that all members and anticipated officials are present. So from members of the Zoning Board of Appeals, Roger DuPont here. Patrick Hanlon here. Elaine Hoffman here. And I am here as well. We do have three members of the board who are unable to attend this evening. So we do have four members so we can still conduct business and vote on things with four members. But the rule that a positive vote does require the vote of four members does still apply. From the town we have Colleen Ralston, our zoning assistant. Here. Good to have you. And I don't believe Mr. Cunningham is joining us this evening. Okay, appearing for docket 3764212 Pleasant Street. We have Nellie Aikenhead. Here. Nellie, good to see you. Appearing for docket 377649 Dixon Avenue. We have Verma Sudhir. Good to see you. Appearing for docket 377795 George Street. We have Jane Youngren and Marianne Henley. I'm sure one of you is here. I saw Jane Youngren earlier. Her name is on here. Okay. And then for docket 378096 Jason Street. We have Mark and Brandy Hoffner. Yep, here. Great. Have you all with us. So this open meeting of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals is being conducted remotely consistent with an act making appropriations for the fiscal year 2023 to provide for supplementing certain existing appropriations and for certain other activities and projects signed into law in March 29 2023. This act includes an extension until March 31st 2025 of the remote meeting provisions of Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 executive orders suspending certain provisions of the open meeting law, which suspended the requirement to hold all meetings in a publicly accessible physical location. Public bodies may continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at a meeting location so long as they provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings. Public bodies may meet remotely so long as reasonable public access is afforded so the public can follow along with the deliberations of the meeting. An opportunity for public participation will be provided during the public comment period during each public hearing. For this meeting, the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals has convened a video conference via the zoom application with online and telephone access as listed on the agenda posted to the town's website, identifying how the public may join. This meeting is being recorded and it will be broadcast by ACMI. Please be aware that attendees are participating by a variety of means. Some attendees are participating by video conference. Others are participating by computer audio or by telephone. Accordingly, please be aware that other folks may be able to see you, your screen name, or another identifier. Please take care to not share personal information. Anything you broadcast may be captured by the recording. We ask you to please maintain decorum during the meeting, including displaying an appropriate background. All supporting materials that have been provided to members of this body are available on the town's website unless otherwise noted. The public is encouraged to follow along using the posted agenda. And as chair, I reserve the right to take items out of order in the interest of promoting an orderly meeting. As the board will be taking up new business at this meeting, as chair, I make the following land acknowledgement. Whereas the Zoning Board of Appeals of the town of Arlington, Massachusetts discusses and arbitrates the use of land in Arlington, formerly known as Monotomy, an Algonquin word meaning swift waters, the board hereby acknowledges that the town of Arlington is located on the ancestral lands of the Massachusetts tribe, the tribe of indigenous peoples from whom the colony, province, and commonwealth have taken their names. We pay our respects to the ancestral bloodline of the Massachusetts tribe and their descendants who still inhabit historic Massachusetts territories today. We do not have any administrative business to conduct this meeting, so we'll move straight into public hearings. Before opening the public hearings, here's some ground rules for effective and clear conduct of tonight's business. After I announce each agenda item, I will ask the applicant to introduce themselves for themselves and make their presentation to the board. I will then request that members of the board ask what questions they have on the proposal. After the board's questions have been answered, I will open the meeting for public comment. At the conclusion of public comment, the board will deliberate and vote on any matters. Any vote taken at this hearing will be preliminary until the written decision is approved by the board at a subsequent meeting. All votes will be conducted by a roll call vote.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 40</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with that, the first item is item two on our agenda, docket number 3764212 Pleasant Street, as a continuance from a prior meeting. And I would open the floor to Nellie Aikenhead to tell us where we are today.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Nellie Aikenhead - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Hello, everybody. We actually sold that property in December. We're no longer the owners, so we are no longer pursuing our permits, and we would like to withdraw our application.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 143</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good. So I think it's clear to the board what is happening here. The deed, I believe the deed was passed in December. Is that correct? Correct. And so whereas the applicant is no longer in possession of the property, the board should accept the request for a withdrawal. So with that, may I have a motion to accept the withdrawal of the application for 212 Pleasant Street? Mr. Chairman, so moved. Thank you, Mr. Handlin. Second. Thank you, Mr. DuPont. So there's a vote of the board to accept the withdrawal of the application for 212 Pleasant Street. Mr. DuPont? Aye. Mr. Handlin? Aye. Ms. Hoffman? Aye. And the chair votes aye. That application is withdrawn. Thank you very much. And thank you for all the time that you put into this. We really appreciate it. Oh, thank you. You're very welcome.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 41</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, we will move on to the next item, which is, excuse me, item three on the agenda, docket 377649 Dixon Avenue. And so if I could ask the applicant to introduce himself and tell us what they are proposing.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sudhir Verma - 252</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, everyone. This is Sudhir. Thank you for the opportunity to take our project. And so basically, we have a Cape house, which is built in 1954. We have been living in this house for almost 80 years now. We bought in 2017. And we really like the neighborhood. But as we grow as a family and being an old house, we wanted to add some space and turn over the existing house. So we are proposing to extend the house in the backyard, which we have plenty of, I think, space and also go up in the height, what is allowed by the town around, I think, 35 feet. So make a three-story kind of house. So I think the variance is because of there are some laws regarding the total area that needs to be added, which is coming down more than, I think, 50% and then some 75 square feet addition that will totally add. It's a Cape, so it's a shed on the top. And then we have a basement where we have a garage also for one car. So I think the current area is around 1700, including the basement. And then it will go up to some 3,000 or 4,000 something total numbers. It's in the file, but I don't have exact numbers. So I think that's the proposal. The front of the house remains the same and the side remains the same. It's just extension in the back in the backyard and on the top.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, the deck is also being changed from right now it's on the, if you stand in the front of the property, it's on the right side. So that deck will come off and give on the left side of the property, which is the other open side of the property, because the property is open from the three sides. That's good. I know you had an architect involved in the project. I don't know if your architect was in attendance and if they wanted to show the plans or if they wanted us to show the plans.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione and Others - 1104</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think our architect is Rob. He has joined us kindly. That's me. I'm happy to show the plans if that's easier for you guys, either way. I can go ahead and pull them up. Okay, great. Okay, you should be the D1 sheet, I think. Yeah, so these are just the demolition plans of the existing house. So the hatched walls, the darker walls are the walls that we're taking down. So we're basically demolishing a considerable portion of the existing structure. All the upper floor is coming off a good portion of the first floor and all of the rear exterior wall is coming out for the addition. And then the basement, we're taking some walls out and we are removing some of the rear foundation to extend the garage. So if you want to go to the next sheet, I can just walk you through the plans real quick. Okay, so what we're planning to do overall is basically do an 18-foot addition off the back. On the basement level, we're going to extend the existing garage to create some tandem parking down there and then just reconfigure some things at a laundry room and a bathroom and a bit of a playroom in the back. At the first floor, we're looking to do a small guest suite in the front there where the recursion is located with a bathroom en suite. And then the living room area on the left is actually existing. So that's going to remain. So yeah, that's existing. But we are adding the kitchen in the back and then a large great room dining room area. Yeah, exactly. And that's where the addition is going to be placed. We're also, as Sudhir had mentioned, there's an existing deck on the right side, which we're going to take out and just put some access stairs in. And we're relocating the deck on the left hand of this plan, which is where those double doors are going out in the back there. Correct. Yeah. And then we're just putting a small front porch on the front entry to kind of make that look a little bit nicer and give a place to stand when you're walking into the building. So if you can go to the next sheet. So the second floor, currently it's a three bedroom house. So we're looking to expand it to a four bedroom house. So we're really doing a whole new second floor. The rear of the house is where the new master suite would be going over the addition. So there's a walk-in closet, a full bathroom, exactly. And then we have two other bedrooms on this floor and then a small office. One of the bedrooms has an en suite bathroom and then there's just a common bath. To kind of round off this floor. And then the upper floor, we're just looking to add some storage in the back. We're doing a cathedral ceiling over the master bathroom. So that's where that X is showing. That's an open ceiling space. And then we have some kind of small bonus rooms that we added in. Some of the ceilings here start to get pretty low. So the area of a seven foot ceiling is fairly limited basically to the center part of this floor plan. And then lastly, we have a small little kind of seating area, exterior seating area to climb a porch on the left hand side. Yep, exactly. And then the last year we have elevations. So I can just kind of walk you guys through that real quick. So the proposed front elevation, so we have a small shed dormer at the top to just give a little more headroom to that upper floor. And we're doing basically all new finishes, all new windows. So it's almost a new structure in a way as far as visually looking at it from the exterior. So double hung windows, things like that. And then showing the roof overhangs. The garage, as you can see, is located below the first floor. So there's a bit of a gray drop into the garage. And then similar in the other elevations, just trying to create some clabber siding. We did a little bit of a different siding at the upper floor to kind of differentiate that from the lower level. But kind of your standard new kind of modern look, but tried to keep it pretty residential to fit in with what's in the neighborhood there now. So just to confirm, so this is the front elevation, so this is the Dixon Avenue side. Correct, yep. This then is on the side street? Yep, exactly. Yeah. So you can see on the left-hand side there, the lower left-hand side is where that new deck would go. Okay. And so this is essentially a 35-foot high wall. Yeah, we're right at that. Well, I should say it's slightly less than 35. It's 35 from the average grade to the peak. And the average grade is slightly below where the actual grade is. So it's maybe like 34. All right. And then this is a rear elevation that's facing the back. And then this is facing the abutting neighbor. Exactly, correct. And those, as you described, the stairs. Okay. So and then I did just, do you see the plot plan now? Yeah, yeah. So this is the plot plan. Yeah, so the proposed addition in the back is 18 by 32. We're showing the proposed deck there on the side. One thing I did notice that the deck on the left-hand side, that's actually an error, that that's going to be gone. So we're just at the proposed landing at overhang. So that deck would be removed. And then there's also, this is, are you contemplating this change to the driveway? Yes. The driveway is right now, I think, 10 feet wide. So we are planning for, I think, 16 feet, something, because you can't open the doors of the cars right now. They bang on the walls, which like, because the driveway is slanting down the line. So you can't close properly, actually, the car. So just to increase the lid, just leave it a little bit so you can don't bang the side walls when opening the car. Okay. And so would there still be a retaining wall on this side here at the edge of the driveway? Yes. Okay. It is currently there. I think it'll be pushed out some, maybe six feet. Because we are adding some space there.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 254</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So the application that came to us, seeking relief under section 542B6, which is the large additions portion of the zoning by-law, so if there's an addition outside the existing foundation of 750 square feet or more, or more than 50% of the volume of the, excuse me, the area of the existing house, then a special permit is required from the board with a couple of additional findings, which we'll review. And also under 539, so 539 is the section that deals with porches and decks that extend into the setbacks. And then while we were doing the review, there were a couple of other things that came up. So the bigger one, I'm going to go back to the side elevation here. So in order to be, a level in a house is considered a story if the distance from the average grade to the ceiling is four foot six or greater. And going by the dimensions here on the drawing with the basement at level at 112, average grade at 113.7, level at 112, average grade at 113.79, and the basement height being six foot eight, the exposed height of the basement is four foot ten and a half, which qualifies it as a story, in which case this is a three and a half story house, and the code only allows up to two and a half stories by right. And so we wanted to bring that to your attention right away to see if that was your intent.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sudhir Verma - 110</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that was not the intent. I think that's where I think we got the call from, like getting down and found us to apply for that also, and that we did. But right, Rob? Yeah, that's one thing we did miss, that that was off by a few inches. So the town said, you know, they got in touch with us and said, hey, you know, you're over on the stories. So that's why we submitted the application, or submitted the additional variance for consideration. Hopefully there's a connection. Maybe. I think, yes, I think. Oh, here he is. He's back again. You're muted, Christian. Christian, we can't hear.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 67</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry about that. I thought things were awfully quiet, and then all of a sudden my screen went blank. So I apologize for that. That was an explanation that really knocked you over. Yeah, it really was. So basically, I just wanted to confirm that, were you aware that this is drawn as three and a half stories at this point, and is that what you're intending?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione - 124</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we were made aware. We weren't aware when we submitted it, and we were made aware. So we submitted the variance to try to seek relief for that as well. Okay. So yeah, it's off by, like you said, exactly 4'10", so it's off by a few inches. And, you know, it's an existing condition, so we're hoping that, you know, you guys consider that as something we can proceed with. Okay. And then the expansion of the width of the driveway, it's less than 20 feet, which a driveway can be up to 20 feet. So just wanted to confirm that. on the drawing. Yeah I mean either way we'll keep it we'll keep it 20 feet or less for sure. </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 196</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then I was look looking back over on the uh so the porches and decks so um if porches are under 539a um I think that so the required setback is 25 feet in this district and there's two front yards so I think that this porch is the one that requires relief but I believe this deck is actually compliant um but we'll make sure that um whatever decision we make that it includes both the deck and the porch um in the in whatever decision we have. And then the we also the other thing that often comes up is usable open space but the surveyor has nicely indicated the area of the usable open space here on the on the site um and so the property is compliant with the usable open space requirement and the landscaped usable landscaped area. So those are the usual site constraints we see. Are there any um I see on here that the the trees are marked out are there I visited the site over the weekend I don't believe there are any trees in the area of the proposed addition is that correct? </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione - 21</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes there is no trees they're all on the boundaries of the property but not on where we are planning. </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 83</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay um okay so what then what the board is going to be reviewing uh we are reviewing um the front porch and the the side deck uh we are reviewing um the large addition and the request those are both special permit actions and then the other would be a variance for an additional story which would need a separate set of findings. Um so with that I'll turn it over to the board if there are questions from the board. </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 191</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. So this is actually directed I think to Mr. Pacione. The variance is required under is governed by state law and there are several criteria for it the first of which is that the uh need for relief must stem from the uh unique characteristics of the property particularly with respect to uh topography soil and Roger help me with I'm blanking on the third one it's something earthy lot shape and so here we have a topography that is an extraordinary the lot shape is pretty much uh rectangular um and uh there's nothing that indicates that there's anything special about the soil conditions and it doesn't really look any different to me when I went out there from the various other lots that are going on and all of the conditions in state law including this one have to be met we can't just ignore one and so I wonder if you could take your best shot as to why it is that your need to relief uh is unique and to this parcel and uh arises from uh soil topography and um and shape.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione - 67</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um well I would guess I'd have to say that you know it's an existing condition um that you know we're very close on um you know is this a unique situation you know it's hard to make that case um I mean maybe a question for the board since we're so close on that measurement is it permissible to just raise the grade around the building?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 154</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that would by you have control over your application and so if you have a way of of avoiding this problem through that way or or any others so that you are within the bounds of the zoning bylaw or something we can grant a special permit on as opposed to a variance then you're obviously are somewhat better off because state law is not very congenial to the reasons why it is that you would like this relief. Yeah. Without seeing a proposal I can't tell you what we would do uh in particular I don't know of any particular reason why you can't change the grading uh is the way in the way you want to do it but uh but obviously a variance is a steep slope for you uh to talk to use a topological metaphor and it would be better to find some other way of compliance probably.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione - 32</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah okay understandable um yeah I think we might have to go that route then um but yeah I'm familiar with the hardship laws um so I understand where you're coming from.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 27</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other questions from the board? A little curious if you had um referred to the town's uh residential design guidelines at all in your proposal.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione - 54</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um yeah I believe we looked at those a while back um okay you know could I cite them to you right now probably not but but yeah we uh we I think we used that when we when we started out originally and you know when Suhair and I first first I met.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 237</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um certainly so the the house is is would be considered single family medium lot um which are sort of like the single family houses lots that are between five and seven thousand square feet um this is a fairly good example a lot of them have the garages under uh which is sort of correct for that type um others of them will have a driveway that runs up the side of the house um usually that if there is a garage it's usually under or you know in the far back of the house um the guidelines do sort of discourage having a wider driveway um and they do sort of encourage more sort of small scale um pieces so this house does you know I'd asked before about the the single vertical plane um there definitely are some places in here where there are um canopies that are added um to the different size sides of the house um there's the deck there's the porch there's the entrance the side entrance steps um on the on the um on the opposite side um um the house seems a little out of context for the neighborhood um can you just talk me through the the roof shape I think that's what's causing me the most yeah did you want to bring up the elevation again and I can kind of show you what we're thinking</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rob Pacione - 747</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay so um it's essentially so the the front elevation we we have a gable um over the kind of front entry area and then a shed dormer um so that you know we used to kind of break up the front elevation um and then if you look at the side elevation with the the deck so that there's the plane of the roof that runs uh so it's kind of a soft side gable I guess you could say the the front plane at the front of the the building runs back and there's a peak over that door to get out of the uh get out to the uh third floor porch area and then there's basically like you could say like a shed roof that runs all the way to the back so you know we we designed this roof especially the back part just to give a little more headroom up up at that upper floor um you know it's pretty tight up there right now and just to give them a little bit of extra bonus space was why we kind of designed the roof the way we did um and you know the house shape was a little tricky to work with to try to do you know a full kind of gable roof that you you might see on a uh you know more of a typical colonial home um so that's kind of the direction we went with this okay this is that upper floor so as you pointed out before this is that section that's open to the master bedroom below yeah exactly yeah so that'll be a cathedral space um you know we put some some transom windows above above the uh the windows in that room so there's a little bit of extra daylight getting in there um and then yeah so adjacent to that just some unfinished storage space um and then those uh those two bonus rooms that we have do you know what the ceiling height is here at the at the back edge um it's fairly low i can tell you in one second um say it's about three foot nine roughly okay because the tag out here says three seven okay yeah that's that's yeah so that tag should really be towards the back wall okay um otherwise it's six four and then is it 7-0 at the ridge um yeah yeah yeah so the ridge is 7-0 um i i consider that a flat ceiling so the ridge is above that a little bit okay um so i tried to you know as best i could kind of highlight where those seven foot ceilings are um but yeah that would be a flat flat ceiling in that area okay and then beyond this this line here are the ceilings essentially cathedral um yeah so that's a bit of a tricky area there so it's you know at the at the the sides of that room are very low that's like a two foot uh you know knee wall there basically and then the center part would be close to seven feet okay um so it's pretty pretty awkward space but we figured you know just leave it open and okay it could be usable to a certain degree there what do i get towards so the right now it's indicated um that the attic living area which is 700 is 275 gross graphite um the criteria for a half story is that it's the distance from the finished floor to the underside of the the roof structure so it's not at the height level it's at the structure um which is why i was asking about the cathedral length because i think that you're very that the areas at the front um this area here and this area here beyond the the shed and this area these areas here at the back none of this has um that this the distance to the structure is probably less than seven feet yes yeah yeah okay yeah i believe that the number we used to you know consider that as to the structure yeah and 275 is definitely significantly smaller than the number that would be half the area of the floor below especially given the cathedral section here that's walled off yeah yeah exactly yeah look at it and stop the share are there any other questions from the board</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon - 438</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mr chairman mr hamlin just out of curiosity i've never really thought about this before but suppose suppose it happened that the it was redesigned uh that top floor the attic so that there was zero um uh zero square feet that actually met the definition of uh being seven foot to the understory of the building obviously that involves a certain amount of reconfiguring of the roof and so forth but just grant me that hypothesis would that make it not a story can you have a story with it would become pure attic at that point um because it would have no habitable area so this is historically this was an issue with the way our bylaw was written in the past that you could state law allowed you to have habitable space at seven feet but our half story definition was seven foot three so if you had a flat roof at seven foot two you had it was not a story but it was fully habitable and so that was changed at town meeting to the definition we have now so that um it's only the portion that is seven feet uh that counts towards the story because the other portions you could not um legally inhabit so the way that the the store the house here is drawn the area um i'll go back to the share come here so this bonus room area here where it's seven feet this is habitable area so this is allowed to be used um and this bonus this portion here you can count as habitable space um but like these portions here you can inhabit them but they're just not they're just awkward spaces essentially right and the cathedral ceiling itself is what that that but i'm what i'm trying to explore is whether there's an alternative way of making the attic a non-story by i mean the amount of living space that is being contributed by the attic to this over is 275 square feet out of approximately 4400 square feet in the house so it's not like it's in a it's a huge percentage and i am certainly the cathedral ceiling will be important for the amenity of the floor below and my question is really whether there's any way to reconfigure the attic so as to avoid the attic counting as a story and get around the story problem that way well at that point they would be down to three stories and not two and a half oh that's that's true unfortunately yeah all right i i missed the second half story</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mr chairman one one question please um so as there was the uh suggestion uh by mr pacione if that's how i you say it sorry pass the island but the question so the question about raising the average grade on the basement level and and i get tangled in this uh each time we sort of run across this but does that mean then by definition it changes from basement to cellar i believe so yeah so the definitions are slightly different um i think the basement and cellar depends on where the midline is um and so and i i yeah i could go to i could go look up the definition um but a residential both basements and cellars count towards gross floor area but um the story definition is very specific with a dimension whereas the the boundary between a cellar and a basement just depends on what percentage of the of that lowest level um is below the average grade and that's half it's either i believe it's half yeah if it's above half it's a basement if it's below half it's a cellar and and the reason it prompts the question is because um as as to the suggestion that the average grade be raised and and i think mr handlin said the same thing that it doesn't necessarily mean that you know we would favor the proposal i would have to look at it more carefully anyway and perhaps do a little bit more research but i just want to make sure that the applicant would be clear that what they're doing is shooting for the story definition based upon um the fact that the basement it has that is it four foot six inches um half beyond above the average grade regardless of whether i'm quoting that right i just think that it needs to be clear to uh the architect that he's shooting for the right you know target yes if that's allowable yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry go ahead sir i was going to say my understanding is yeah that but we would need to raise the average grade you know five inches or so in order to make this structure go from a three and a half story to a two and a half story so that's uh that's what i would uh be trying to achieve by by changing the average grade be trying to achieve by by changing the average grade so so just with the discussion quickly so is this house consumers i was looking at the old records at the town site it listed the house as 1.5 stories so that was not like that was different at that time and the logic because or there is some settling of the ground that is causing this uh half or five inches or six inches whatever you're talking about is causing the change in the definition of story yeah no unfortunately for us it's you know it's a it's a very it's very crisp and clear in the documentation so we do have to follow what's in the in the submitted information oftentimes the assessor's information is sometimes um doesn't necessarily hold to the same standard that the building department records do so there's often a discrepancy between the two </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Mr. Chair, thank you. Steve Moore, Piedmont Street. I was unable to join you by Zoom tonight. I do have a question or two for the applicant. I know that it may be premature, but I haven't seen a tree plan that would be required to attend this. My guess is that would be required in the subsequent documentation. Is that true? It should be. The applicant had earlier stated that there were no trees that were impacted by the work that has proposed. But as the applicant, I don't know if you have submitted anything to the tree department? No, not at this time, because I think, as I said before, the trees are not, there are no trees in the way of the construction. Everything is on the boundary of the property, so nothing is there. The building, you know, for permit, my understanding is that the building department will require that to have, that exchange would have taken place. Yeah. Sorry, Mr. Moore? Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. Actually, for a work of this magnitude, a tree plan will be required, not just in it being exchanged with the tree warden, to talk about how all the trees around the periphery of this property, which it looks like that's where all the trees are, how, where the construction is going to happen and construction vehicles are going to enter and concrete is poured or whatever has to happen, how they'll all be protected from their critical root zones around each one of the trees in it. And Mr. Chairman, it does look like some of the trees will, their root zones will be significantly impacted. Like, for instance, if I look on Street View, I can see on the right-hand side of the property, there's a tree which isn't huge, but it looks sort of like an apple tree or something. And they're talking about, I believe, expanding the driveway into the root zone of where that tree is at, and that is in the setback. So I'm wondering, I just am wanting to caution the applicant that they are going to need to think through their approach to protecting the trees as part of this project. Sure, we'll do. I mean, I think that is a dogwood tree, which is, I believe you are referring to, which is right next to the deck right now. But in fact, the deck will be taken off. So, yeah, I don't know how much is that, like, yeah, I think when the construction or the building permits will, like as Mr. Klien said, that we'll have that, all the tree plan involved in that, that part of that. That is- Right. Yeah, we'll have that done. And do the- Yes, Mr. Chair, it's just that in expanding the driveway, I know that that means usually digging down and tree roots are not well impacted. The deck probably sits on top of the current grade and it doesn't really excavate into it. So I just want to caution that they need to think that through when they draw a poll permit. Thank you, Mr. Chair. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moore. Are there other members of the public who wish to address this hearing? Seeing none, I will go ahead and close the public comment period for this particular hearing. So what the board has in front of us, we have two special permit requests. One is for a large addition, one is for the porch and the deck that extend out towards the property lines on the two front facades of the building. In addition, there's currently the need for a variance due to the number of stories that the proposed house as it is currently documented is three and a half stories. And there was the statement from Mr. Moore from the tree committee about just the question about the tree and the adjacent to where the proposed expansion of the driveway is. So I would turn to the board and I believe it was Mr. Dupont or Mr. Hannon who has said it before that it might be advantageous for the board to see that if the board is concerned that the variance criteria cannot be met on this property. And with that, the applicant has put forth that they would be interested in raising the grade so that the average grade is increased so that the lowest level no longer qualifies as a story. And I think the request that was made by the board member was that we see what that looks like before we would move forward with any votes to the matter because that would certainly impact what we need to approve and what the scope of what we need to approve will be. So I would ask if the applicant would be amenable to a continuance to allow them to explore what their options would be for raising the grade and how that would impact their need for a variance. </blockquote>

So if you want, we can continue to the January 23rd. And if you're unable to make that date, just let us know. And then you'll have to come briefly before us and we'll just continue again. Yeah, if that works for you guys, that would be ideal. Okay. We can do that. Yeah, we'll try to work with our surveyor and see. Okay. Do you have any additional questions for the board? I don't.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. I don't actually want to see anything as complete as a tree plan, but it would be helpful to me, at least to have, to make sure that the applicant has looked at what is likely to be required in order to save the trees on the site and make sure that they at least have taken the first step towards an analyzing this with the understanding they're going to have to go before the tree warden and get the approval of a tree plan. I was impressed that they have, well, it's true that not much of the addition, none of the addition is going to actually happen where there are currently trees. The backyard is largely devoid of trees. There's nevertheless a series of trees that are, some of which are, the one further back is quite large that is potentially affected by construction activities. And I just like to be certain that that is front and center on the applicant's radar and that they have a clear sense of what problems that would pose and what the solutions would be. It may be they pose no problems at all, but at this point, I think that it would be helpful to know that they've taken the next step of thinking about it and coming to a recent conclusion about it. Thank you. </blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sudhir Verma - 87</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think that's one of the reasons we actually bought this property is because of the trees. So if you do want the trees, that's why, means we are like, means, I think we have eight trees in our property and nobody else in our neighborhood has that many trees. It's all in our properties, almost eight. If I understand your request, you don't need a tree plan, but for our next meeting, right? Or do we need a tree plan for the next meeting? </blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Patrick Hanlon? - 116</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't, from my point of view, you don't really need to have a tree plan. We don't get to approve tree plans anyway. The tree warden who knows much more about this than we do will do that. I would just like to have a first step of saying, in general, this is the strategy we do. We thought about the potential construction impacts and what you think as your basic outline is tree plan before you actually go final on it, just to be sure that the first step of analyzing it has taken place and you're aware of any problems that might exist and that we can have that degree of assurance. </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sudhir Verma - 126</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, we could talk to the tree warden and have our surveyor also maybe make some suggestions. I do think that tree by the driveway is going to be impacted looking at it now, so. Yeah, because I think it's, the first tree maybe a little bit, but I think on the boundaries, I think the advantage is we have a side lane or a side street, which is open and the distance between the trees is pretty big. I think it's one and a half, like it's a hundred feet. So each tree is approximately 20 feet, 25 feet apart from each other. So, but yeah, I think we do have, we will take into consideration to not impact any of the streets. </blockquote>

With having a dog, it's great to be able to wipe her off from the snow and the salt and the sand and everything. And for folks to put their jackets and things when we have visitors. And a front deck, I would love. I deliver meals on wheels with the amount of folks that I see that are isolated in their homes and there are people that will sit on their driveway in a chair. I'd love to be able to just sit out on our front porch and say hi to all the neighbors when they walk by. So that's what we're proposing is a little bit larger foyer and a front deck. </blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 399</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I'll go ahead and share the drawings here. So what you have here is the existing house. They have an existing small vestibule on the front side of the house with a couple of steps leading up to it and then walk down to George Street. And what they are proposing is a larger enclosed entry on the front, a bigger stoop and then also having a section of roof to deck off on the side. So this is the existing condition and that's rendered here. And then this is the proposed condition. So this is the enclosed, the entry piece and then this is the deck that's beside it. And that's the full extent of the work as I understand it. Yes, it is. Okay. And then just a couple of the side elevation and a couple of structural details. And so this project is submitted as a special permit application under 539. So the 539A and it requires the board to make a special permit finding that because the proposed entry piece is larger than 25 square feet that the board is required to make a finding with the special permit category in order to approve the plan. Let me go with that. Oops, too far on this side of the screen. There we go. Works in enclosed entrances, largely allowed above may be extended into the minimum yard regulations otherwise provided for the district by a special permit. And the required front yard setback is 25 feet and this would be reducing that to 20 foot three. With that, we'll go ahead and stop the share and ask the board if there are any questions on this application. Seeing none. Go ahead and again, open the hearing for public comment. Public questions and comments are taken as they relate to the matter at hand and should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing its decision.

I just wanted to say that I think the porch and the bigger foyer are gonna be a really nice feature on their house. I can't think of any way that the small reduction in the setback would be disruptive to us on the block. We have a really friendly and sociable block. There's always kids playing and people walking dogs and everyone chatting. And I can already picture Jane and Marianne sitting out there with their dog or their friends and keeping an eye on what the kids are up to and chatting with us as we walk by. I think it will be a really great addition to our street. Thank you. That's lovely. Thank you so much. Next is Jessica Pesk. </blockquote>

I'm jealous actually myself. And Jane and Marianne are sort of like the captains of our street. So I think like Emily, I can already see them sitting out there on the porch and just like overseeing the whole neighborhood, which we are all always very thankful for. So I definitely recommend approving it. </blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christian Klein - 464</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Are there any other members of the public who wish to? speak? Seeing none, I'll go ahead and close the public comment period for this hearing. So this is a very simple and straightforward application as a request for a front porch and an enclosed front entrance. I'll say the only question I had for the applicant so at the front door when you've the way it's drawn right now when you get to the front door there's not a covering on that outside door and it's not until you get you get into the entryway that you're covered. I just want to confirm that that was what you intended. Yes that's what we have now in our foyer now we have a door that swings out and you walk into the foyer and that's closing because there's the covered area. Very good. And so this is again this is under 539A where porches are enclosed entrances larger than 25 square feet in area may extend into the minimum yard by special permit and so there are seven special permit criteria which the board needs to make a finding on. So the first is whether the requested use is allowed or allowed by special permit in the district and it is under 539A. Why the requested use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. I think the the neighbors spoke very well to that that this provides an opportunity for the residents to better participate in the activity of the street and to make it a more welcoming and cohesive community which are definitely goods for this and for any neighborhood. Number three is the requested use will not create undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety. It would certainly do neither. It could possibly improve pedestrian safety by the additional attention being paid by those who would now have a porch to be on the front of the house. Number four the requested use will not overload any public system. It will not have any direct impact on any public systems. Requested use will not impair the character or integrity of the neighborhood. The front entry porches are ubiquitous over Arlington as our front porches and as the neighbors stated that this is very well in keeping with that pattern. Requested use will not be detrimental to public health or welfare. There would be no negative impacts and it will not cause an excess of use detrimental to the neighborhood. So I think the board could make those those seven findings which would allow the board to vote on this application. Are there any other questions from the board in regards to this application? If not the chair would entertain a motion. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you both. It occurs to me now that of course I have skipped over a step. So I have skipped over the the all-important condition step. So for applications such as this the board typically applies three standard conditions which I will now read into the record. The first is that the plans and specifications approved by the board for the special permit shall be the final plans and specifications submitted to the building inspector of the town of Arlington in connection with this application for zoning relief. There should be no deviation during construction from approved plans and specifications without the express written approval of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. Standard condition number two is the building inspector is hereby notified they are to monitor the site and should proceed with appropriate enforcement procedures at any time they determine that violations are present. Building inspectors shall proceed under section 3.1 of the zoning bylaw and under the provisions of chapter 40 section 21d of the Massachusetts general laws and institute non-criminal complaints. If necessary the building inspector may also approve and institute appropriate criminal action also in accordance with section 3.1 and condition number three that the board shall maintain continuing jurisdiction with respect to the special permit grant. Are there any additional conditions which members of the board would want to propose? </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hanlon. This isn't an additional condition though it used to be but I just wanted to draw the attention of the board and the applicant to the provision 5.3.9d which now makes it clear that the porch does not become a part of the foundation wall and that any enclosing of the porch beyond what is present today would require an additional special permit but that doesn't have to be a longer one of the conditions because it's now been added to the bylaw. </blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Leone - 728</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I'm right here. Attorney John Leone representing the Huffners. We are seeking a special permit slash variance under section 5.9.2b1 is the corner of their garage is three feet from the property line which is in violation of section 3.6 of the property setback requirements requiring a six foot setback. What they're asking for the variances for that particular corner as it's an existing garage that already is there what they're proposing to do is put a small addition a renovate the second floor put a spiral staircase up to that second floor an exterior stairway for second means of egress and add a small dormant area to the back of the garage which wouldn't be visible. We submitted the plans and elevations which show that the dormant area that's going to be added matches the character and integrity of the building itself as well as the main home. The building is already serviced by I believe under the groundwater and utility lines and it has its own existing I believe storage line running out to the street already. So they just want to put an ADU in there about 781 square feet onto that second floor area and it's proposed anticipated it'll be one to two occupants at most in there. Thank you. I just wanted to add that it's more of a restoration project because it actually it's a historic property and it used to be an apartment and we did already get approval from the historic commission for the designs. Thank you very much. I was just going to ask Mr. Lowney about that. The historic district Joanne Robinson has issued I believe and it's on should be in your file a letter of approval. Yes yeah so we'll go ahead and share that. So this is the letter from the Arlington Historical Commission. It essentially says how the plants of the restorations expresses what is in the drawings that are before us as well. That essentially it's an existing structure. The only thing that's being added really is the the dormer with the two gables to the shed in between and changes of windows and converting some louvered areas into windows. And they plan on rebuilding the cupola that's existing. And then there's going to be an exterior stair and this has all been approved in December by the historic commission. So that is all approved. This is the plot plan of the site adjacent street at the front Norfolk on the side. You can see that one corner up front on the garage it's too close. Yeah in the rear corner is seven point almost eight feet back. You know the other side yes there you go. Yeah right there right. But this but this is exist this carriage house is entirely existing there's no changes whatsoever to the location or foundation correct? That is correct. I believe it's probably a contemporaneous with the main house. Yeah. So then these are the drawings. So the front corner so this is that corner that we were looking at that is most adjacent to the side lot line. Right. The proposed entrance stair here on the side and the dormer that will face the rear. So the only other proposed on the front is that door way to the extreme right the passage to a door. That's the side that's against the property line rear you can egress door windows and that's the cupola. And then the side facing the house with this with the egress stair from the second floor. Correct. And then the garage level so the door in there's a proposed staircase to connect the two levels. Will the garage still be used as a for storage of vehicles? I believe so. I believe that's the plan is not Mr. and Mrs. Sautner. That's correct yes it will be. Okay. And then up above this is the proposed living area. Up on the upper floor so 781 square feet so it is less than the 900 square foot maximum for an 80. Yes. And then just framing plans section. Yeah you can see the dormant area in the back. Right. We also had submitted some photographs of the existing. If you wish to see those or have any questions about those we'd be glad to answer them. Well that's it. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah that will bring you to a file. It's a google drive file I believe of some sort and it's just was way too many photos to upload and download. All right let's see if this works. Let's stop and then reshare. There we go. There we go. That's one of the exterior photos. So I believe that's the existing door in the rear of the garage. I believe so yes. Yeah on the side. On the side okay. Yeah near the house. I believe that's the offending corner. And then so this is the side that faces that. Yeah you can see the building is in need of repair. Yeah. Which is the renovation project they wish to undertake as well. That's what there goes that stairwell that stairwell and railing is what they'll be matching on the new stairway. Okay. Yeah. And then this this dormer feature is what they're looking as well correct? Correct. Yeah it's a mini version of that. And you can see where that new entrance doorway will be. Again matching. That's where the stairwell will be located. Yeah and the new entry doors and yeah effectively here on that upper level. That's the existing rear. More detail. Yeah there's a lot of them. Um That's just a example of a Jason property. Well I think that's more of a an example of the cupola. Oh I see okay. Yeah that's an uh the our existing cupola has slats. This one is an example just up the street on Jason as well using glass. But I think we're trying to match. Oh okay. Right in their house. Yes in the view of the street. Yep. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Great. So this is coming before us. So apologies to the to the applicant for all the confusion over this. Um they were initially directed to the ARB on this. Um and the ARB turned it back to the Zoning Board of Appeals. It was filed as a variance but this is actually under the ADU bylaw which is section 592 B1 paragraph 5. The this the board may approve an accessory dwelling unit in a non-attached building that non-attached building that is within six feet of the property line by a special permit. And the board needs to make a specific finding in that regard. And the the finding that the board needs to make is that the creation of an accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the use of such accessory building as a private garage or other allowed use. So that's what's before the board. Um I had also looked at the does that residential design guidelines on this. Um but seeing as it has been through Historic, Historic will have done a far greater job of reviewing the design the extra design intent uh than this board would do. Uh so we'll defer to them. Um are there any questions uh or comments from the board in regards to this application? </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Chair? Ms. Huffman? Um I'll just note that I think this is the first or one of the first AD um accessory dwelling units in a um you know historic property that we've seen on this board. Is that right? I think so. First yeah it's just it's nice to see it incorporated in a historic property. Definitely interesting that this this definitely appears that that this was inhabited in the past. Do you have any sense as to when it was last occupied? </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From from what we learned from uh the prior owner as well as just looking at old drawings and if you look at the state we have pictures I don't know John if those were uploaded as well we have pictures of the internal. I mean it's kind of destroyed now right run over by raccoons and stuff like that but it was clearly set up as a chauffeur's quarters. So I do believe it's original to the house. Um those like for example those tiny windows that you saw on the right side of the garage are the old stall or stall windows. Um so I believe that was what it was for originally. Um that's the that's the most context we were able to kind of dig up. We don't have like the original blueprints or anything like that unfortunately. Yes see that would explain the sewer and water lines versus chauffeur quarters. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there other questions or comments from the board? Seeing none I will open the board. The board, excuse me, open the hearing for public comment. Public comment is taken as it relates to the matter at hand. It should be directed to the board for the purpose of informing its decisions. Members of the public who wish to speak should digitally raise their hand using the button on the reactions tab in the Zoom application. Those calling in by phone might dial star nine to indicate they would like to speak. Are there any members of public who wish to address the board on this application? I see none. So I'll go ahead and close the public comment period for this hearing. So as I said before, the board would need to make a finding that the creation of the accessory dwelling unit is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the use of such accessory building as a private garage or other allowed use. Certainly this is sort of a unique situation where it is actually being returned to its former residential use after a period of disuse. And to assist the board in making this decision, we typically review the seven findings that were required for a special permit. So the first of those is whether the use is allowed or allowed by a special permit in the district, and it is under 539B. The requested use is essential or desirable to the public convenience or welfare. So the increase in housing stock is very much a noted need in this town and in the region, and the return of an unused residential unit to the pool of available residences is absolutely desirable to the town. Use would not create undue traffic congestion or impair pedestrian safety. It definitely appears that the existing house and driveway are well able to accommodate should the resident of the unit have a vehicle and would not otherwise detriment anything with traffic or pedestrian safety. Would not overload any public system. It is already connected, and otherwise it would be sort of a de minimis increase in the use of those services. Would not impair the character and integrity of the neighborhood. I commend the applicant for their work with the Historic Commission on really designing something that is very much in keeping with the character of the house and the character of the neighborhood, and certainly the historic nature of both. Would not be detrimental to public health or welfare. Residential neighborhood, residents using a residential neighborhood would not do so, and it would not cause an excess use detrimental to the neighborhood. And I know this is within the character and the intent of the zoning bylaws. So are there any additional questions or comments from the board in regards to the findings the board needs to make? Seeing none, I will remember to go onto the condition section this time. There are three standard conditions that the board would include. Those have been previously read into the record. This evening, we'll not read them in again, unless anyone would particularly like to hear me read them again. So those are the three standard conditions. Are there any additional conditions which members of the board feel would be appropriate for this application? Seeing none, the chair will entertain a motion. </blockquote>

Have a good evening. Okay, so with that, the board has, our next hearing date is January 23rd. There are three, there were three items on that agenda and now we have a possible continuance of Dixon Avenue that may also occur on that evening. And then past that, we have February 13th, which I believe there's two items on the agenda at the moment. And then February 22nd, 27th, excuse me, after that. That was our things coming up. Are there any other items the board needs to discuss at this time? Nope. Seeing none, I would like to thank you all for your participation in tonight's meeting of the Arlington Zoning Board of Appeals. I appreciate everyone's patience throughout the meeting.
