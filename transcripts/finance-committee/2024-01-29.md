<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 71</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome back, everyone. I think because of the special time meeting in October, it seems like we never stopped meeting, but we did a little bit, but it's good to see everybody. And I'd like to introduce our newest member, Michael Rundgren. Michael, why don't you say a little bit about yourself, and then we'll go around and introduce ourselves. I didn't have enough to do on Monday and Wednesday. Welcome.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I'm a bit of a nerd for policy and official functions and things like that. I counted once, I've got at least three copies of Robert's Rules of Order at home on different bookshelves. I don't know, I like scrutinizing minutia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that. You have already hit the ground running because you've already met with the financial budget working group, so that's great. Be careful, he's got a story. Well, let's go around the room. I think you know many of us, but not all of us, and if we could just say our names and what precinct we represent. I am Christine Deschler. I'm the chair, as you know, and I represent Precinct 19.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm very happy to introduce our new member. Up until a week ago or so, we had a full complement at 21. Unfortunately, I have to say that Shane Glendale has resigned. Reluctantly, he got a new job, which is taking and consuming all of his time. And I think you all understand that situation. I made him promise that once this job settles down, he might consider coming back when he gets into a routine. I don't think that job's going to settle down. No. He's head of legislative liaison for state executive office of health and human services. Oh, no. Yeah, no, that's not. He has a big load on his plate. Yes. I completely understand. He got that job in the fall and he continued to help out with the concept. So that is a loss, but we have gained Michael Rubin. So that is good. So the game plan for tonight, we will, first of all, review and approve the minutes of the last two meetings that we had in October. Then I want to spend a few minutes talking about scheduling with next few weeks, few months. And if we have anybody who can update us on any off-season efforts, any working groups, any liaisons having information for us. And then I think we have some budgets. All right. So that is fabulous. I really appreciate people getting those budgets ready from the get-go. Before we start with minutes, I will make one plug for those people who have not yet completed ethics training. I see heads avoiding my eyes right now. Looking right at you. I know exactly now who has not done it and who has. I myself only did it late Friday night. So complete it. And Tara, you will be tasked with being the repository of the certification. And I'm going to have Tara tell me who has not done them.</blockquote>

<summary>2. Review and approve minutes</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 89</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So with that, I guess it's minutes, right? Yes. So first up is October 5th, which was completely remote, where we were talking about special town meeting. What is that completely remote? Yes. I think this was. Oh, no. Yeah. Okay. Someone, some people were. Yeah. Okay. It's a hybrid. Okay. So that'll be one thing to update. Does everyone have the minutes? Or does anyone see other than noting that it was a hybrid meeting? Does anyone have any corrections to the minutes of October 5th?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 David McKenna and Tara Bradley - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave. Tara, can you tell me if I participated in that meeting? I don't remember. Yes, you were there. What's the discussion? It's just come back. This was the Thursday meeting.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 181</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. I don't see anyone raising their hand for corrections. Is there a motion to approve the minutes of October 5th? So moved. Is it seconded? I second. All right. All in favor, say aye. Aye. All opposed? Any abstentions? Mike, one abstention. So it's. 13, 4, 0, that's one abstention. I abstain as well. I was up there. Okay. 12, 4, and 1. Yep. All right. 12, 4, and 2. All right. Next is Tuesday, the 17th. This was in the town manager conference room. Is that right? Before special town meeting? It was before special town meeting. Yeah. So was the other one actually at the special town meeting then? Or at the. I think it was. Yeah, it was. Okay. All right. Being here, that's a session. All right. Any corrections, revisions to the minutes of October 17th? Is there a motion to approve? So moved. Second? Second. All right. All in favor, raise your hand. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 13. Any opposing? Any abstentions? 1. All right. So the minutes are completed.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>3. Discuss scheduling</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 240</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Scheduling. All right. First of all, everyone could plan. To attend FinCon meetings every Monday and Wednesday until we finish. Except we won't be meeting on President's Day, Monday the 19th. I think right now we're going to, I think we should plan that the default will be in-person meetings unless otherwise announced or notified. For example, if we have a snow day or for whatever reason, maybe we have people presenting who can't get their group all in, I'll figure that out. But the default will be in-person meetings here Mondays and Wednesdays. If there is a day when we don't have enough on an agenda to make it worthwhile to meet, I will cancel that meeting, but I will let everyone know ahead of time. The other thing about scheduling. I would like to complete our work by Monday, March 25th. I would like to have everything voted on, buttoned up by then, all the presentations, all the budgets done so that Al Jones and Tara and I can start working on the report. And I might leave maybe April, Wednesday, April 3rd as a backup date to button anything up that needs to be buttoned up. We have to reload something, maybe we'll do it then. But I really would like everyone to strive to have all of their budgets done and presented by the 25th of March. Okay, so the 19th or the 25th?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 35</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 25th of March, yeah. The 19th is tight because the insurance really doesn't come in until then, so we need to plan on having health insurance be at one of the last two meetings.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 378</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, so for those of you who do have those budgets that we really do have to wait, I want to make sure that they're done as soon as, soon after you can do them, but I want all the other budgets done before then so that we can dedicate those late meetings to things that can't be done sooner than that. Also, let's see, capital planning is coming in on Wednesday, March 6th, so mark your calendar for that. And then it'll be coming in on Monday, March 11th. For those things we know, we've already scheduled. Do we know about public schools? No, so I'm going to ask the schools working group to try to get the schools in, you know, ideally the 18th or the 20th of March, if that's possible. Last year we had them in on March 21st. Capital planning is in on March 6th and Minuteman is in on March 11th. The other group we need to schedule is community preservation, which last year I recall was somewhat of a chore getting them to respond, so we might just give them a date and tell them to take it. So you and I can talk about that. Okay, Al Tassi has agreed to be our warrant review officer, and for Michael, what that means is when we get the draft warrant, Al Tassi will look through and see which ones we typically, which ones we always have a meeting on to discuss, and which warrant articles we might want to consider having proponents in to discuss with us, and then reschedule those. So he will take the first crack at that, and I'll work with Alan on that. So as soon as we have a draft warrant, we'll pick those up to get that out to you. Anything else about scheduling? Any questions people have? Everyone knows that town meeting is starting later, a day later, two days later this year. So I don't know when that, how that works out to an hour and a quarter, but I want to work on it, start working on it sooner rather than later, which is a big reason why I want us to finish our work on the 25th, or by the 25th.</blockquote>

<summary>4. Updates from Working Groups/Liaisons</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 73</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, that is all I have on that. Working groups and liaisons. A couple of people already have been acting as liaisons, and I just want to confirm that they'll continue to do that this season. My first one is Arts and Culture, Annie, you're on board with that. Sophie, you have been working with the Disability Commission, are you still? Great. Carolyn, you volunteered to do some work for the audience.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Carolyn White - 63</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, and I'm pushing that they actually request more money, so just as a warning. We have no machines, no machines. Not yet. Have you, do you know if the War Advice Group has talked to the Capital Planning Committee? No. I'll ask them that. We have a meeting, I think we moved it to this coming Monday. Daryl, you know that answer.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 23</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daryl, Michael Daryl is our Capital Planning Committee liaison designee, and do you know if Water Bodies has asked for any capital money?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer - 3</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don't.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 37</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. We have our department person is out on leave, so that sort of changed things a bit right now, but it's a very active volunteer group. Are they looking for money, capital money for this year?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer - 2</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not, no.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 80</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the last, right, the plan is already, yes. Last year's discussion, as I recall, there were suggestions that they pursue capital like funding for these bigger projects that seem to be kicking down the road. So, so we'll have them in, and Carolyn, maybe you can be in charge of shepherding them in earlier rather than later. Sure. Okay, so you can figure out when they'll be, as soon as they'll be available, come meet with us. Okay.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 38</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask where the articles of the warrant come from that have to do with business functioning of the town, like borrowing authority and stuff like that is more managerial than actual, you know, wants and requests?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler, Annnie LaCourt and Others - 565</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are, those are things that are included in every, every, every junior. Do they come from us? I think, no, the town manager. I believe the only people who have the right to insert an article automatically are the select or the ARB in this. Chair of the Finance Committee. Say it again? Chair of the Finance Committee. Okay. Can I just, for a point, Michael. So administrative borrowing will, it will go in as a standard article, but it will get wrapped into the capital planning presentation. When they come through, they ask us to vote on three things. The first is the capital budget. The second is borrowing. So it gets reviewed there. Last year, the junior high school kids, if you remember, they had that, they came to us and asked for money and everyone's surprised, including us. We said, yes, and they really did a nice presentation to tell me. But we made it, made it contingent that they were going to report back to us. Does a couple of people, probably people who are involved with that group, want to follow up with them? So who's, who's following up here? I had one of the, I had one of the crunch in my living room most weekends. It's really not a hard thing to follow up on. So you'll let us know whether or not we need to beat them all about the head and shoulders. And some are freshmen and some are all freshmen. Well, there was one that was, was a year younger. So she's still in eighth grade, but maybe she's dropped off and it's not working on something. But it would also have been on either Charlotte or the teacher, yeah, the teacher or the DPW stuff. Yeah, I think, I think much of the responsibility was Charlotte's and the money wasn't supposed to spend, but that's only until the direction of the time after. So, all right. So maybe there's also an email to Ms. Miller to say, did this happen? Yeah. So if, you know, I'm happy to send Charlotte an email to follow up from that side. That'd be great. I've never done that before. I just thought about it. Yeah, I know. All right, so Dan and Annie will follow up on that. Yeah, you know, actually, I did just thought about it. I drive for another one of the performers to school every morning. All right. So I'm going to hit him with it tomorrow morning. All right. It's going to be great. It's going to be great. I wonder, too. Don't mess up with their presentation. They did a good job. Yeah, they did. It's scary. Um, I apologize. I forgot. What did the Little Darwin's ask for? $5,000. For? 14 restaurants would participate in a 12-month pilot on composting with one of the compost companies that already works in town to demonstrate that it was a valid process that more of the restaurants in town should participate in. And I asked Kickstand, and she said, we already do that. So we're not going to be one of the people they ask. So there are some restaurants or coffee shops already doing it and trying to convince others. Yeah. It's a good awareness-raising campaign, isn't it? Yeah. Right. Right. All right, so thank you, Dan, and thank you, Annie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the DPW people were going to do some research into our Motor Vehicle Equipment Repair Division, but none of them, neither of them, I don't think. Jordan. Jordan, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. So I spoke with Jennifer last week, and we're scheduled to meet with DPW, which I think next, not this Friday, but the following Friday. So we're going to discuss a few things with them. All right, keep us posted. All right, anything else anyone is working on that I have left off the list?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>5. Review Budgets</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 371</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, well, with that, I think we have some budgets to go through. So as an educational point for Michael and also a reminder for everyone else, we have what we call the John Alex rule, which means it is on you all to look at the budgets before they're presented and get your questions to that working group responsible for that budget. So for example, Daryl and John are working on police, fire, and inspectional services. So it's on you to look at those budgets and get them your questions so that when they come to present their budget, they have answers to your questions. The point being, we want to avoid Daryl presenting, Daryl and John presenting, and then having questions that they can't answer. And we can't vote on that budget. We have to delay it. So tonight, we have some budgets that maybe people weren't prepared to look into. So I'll be a little bit more tolerance if people have questions. And we also have some time. And I think that the people who are presenting the budgets won't probably know the answer anyway, but they can probably get answers to the questions pretty quickly in time for the next meeting. But from here on forward, you've got to look at the budgets and get your questions to whoever is responsible for those budgets. And those who are getting those questions, try to get the answers ready. So again, we're trying to avoid having to postpone voting on a budget so that somebody can get the answers to the questions. Now, having said that, there will be some important questions that come up and some issues that legitimately we should postpone the budget so that we can get that answer. But whenever possible, get your questions in. And we'll try to be efficient and meet that March 25th deadline. Can you try and post in the agendas, maybe out a week or so, what budgets might be coming up? What I would like to do is at the end of every meeting, I'm going to ask people who expects to have budgets ready. We know now, right, Darrell, you are thinking of Monday or next Wednesday?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer - 38</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next Monday. We should be able to do pre-spire inspections. And those are big budgets, so take a look at them. And before we break tonight, I'll ask if anyone has any budgets that they can look into.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 55</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I just add something? I also have a tracker. And so in the tracker, there's a schedule. So as we know about things that are coming up, I am adding it to the schedule. We wouldn't put it on the agenda, because then if we handle it on it or stuck with it, yeah.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 28</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. If a budget comes up and we can handle it, I'd rather get to handle it rather than say, oh, we can't, so let's post it. Charlie.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 19</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Chair, have you asked the town manager to be prepared to talk about the $600,000 shortfall on Wednesday?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 73</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I'm actually meeting with him tomorrow. And it's a good reminder that on Wednesday, that town manager can talk to us about his proposed budget, the current long-range plan, and any other issues and concerns. And I expect that that will take up, typically takes up most of the meeting. So take a look at the long-range plan and come with your questions to the town manager. This is the opportunity. Brent.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Carolyn White - 172</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the insurance numbers matter for the infamous water and sewer budget as well. And I am a little concerned about the, because they get the insurance number, but I don't get the changes until five days later or something if I'm lucky. So what date is that that they're saying that they're going to have the numbers? Mid-March. Oh, no, firm date. Yeah. But I am picking up the lead on that, and I didn't know you needed numbers so fast. So let me make a note that I have to make sure I or Aaron or Alex get your numbers. Sure. What am I supposed to? I don't think you're supposed to do anything. I think that comes from someone else. Yeah, yeah, but it's probably Alex or- Well, whoever's handling it. Okay, yeah. I'll tackle that. And these two are questions that we can ask the town manager and deputy. I thought there was a date. I thought I heard the date mentioned, but there's no date. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the first budget we can start with is our own. And what Sophie and I had realized is that it was right off the bat, there was an error. Good job. All right. So in the book on page- well, it starts at page 20. You'll notice in the salary and wages 5100 line, there's a change in $550. What happened there was that was picked up twice. That change is actually in the current budget set in. The $550 was when former member Peter Howard was the recording secretary. He received a stipend of 550. Well, since he left the finance committee, Tara was willing to take that position over and transferred the 550 to her, just to her salary. And so we brought it to the budget directors. Actually, the deputy town managers. And there's a new page coming along. So that 550, it's been dropped. It's already included in the 8903. This happened last year when we voted the numbers and we calculated them here in the finance committee. So as you know, we just attacked it before it came to us. We had to wait for it to come to us. So it should be updated in their system, so it could not be a problem for next year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan, do you need a copy of this? I got it. So having said that, the budget figure for us would be $11,848. And just like all other salaries and wages that are in all our budgets, I think it was in the explainer, but the poll numbers haven't been put in yet for the year. So even on our small budget, there will be a small increase once they finalize those poll numbers. That's the case for everything. And they're all going to go up. Yeah, that's what was explained to us. So it won't affect ours much because the numbers aren't very high. I think it was in the explainer. It was, yeah. Any questions about the Fintom budget? What is the otherwise unclassified number? I'm sorry, I can't hear you. What's otherwise unclassified? For us? Yeah. Those are the trainings and seminars that we go to and pay. There's a lot of things. Okay. Okay. Will we need to re-vote the budget once that increases or would that be under like the elasticity? I think it is a new seller reserve. Yes. Oh, okay. So that would cover those increases.</blockquote>

All right, all in favor say, aye. Aye. Any opposed? All right, unanimous. We're buying a thousand so far. Do you have any other budget? I don't know, but we have to re-vote it. After another day. Yeah, why don't we do a... We've actually met with everybody. Well, take it away. Take it away. What's next? We've been camping out at the town hall for the last week and a half.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, sure. Okay, we're going to go to the selecting budget, which is on page... 20, it starts on 23. I can start, yeah. So, starting at the top with the salaries and the wages, I think the... So, the decrease is just a change in Marie Left and a change in positions throughout. The one thing we want to highlight here is the vacant position for principal, clerk, and typist. This has been vacant since July 2021. We bring it up every year in talking to them and we'll bring it up to you at the committee. Since 2021, the FTE has dropped from 1.02, a 0.54 in last year's budget. So, there's less money for that spot, but they keep carrying that vacancy. It was explained to us that what happens is the chair of the select board is the one that determines whether to fill that position. And the chair position changes every year. So, by the time the office convinces one to hire, the term's up and it goes to the next one who says, no, we don't need to hire. And that's what's been going on. So, my follow-up question or our follow-up question was, well, how much is going to free cash since this has been a vacant position?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, prior to the vacancy, only 4,000 was going to free cash from the select board. Since it's been vacant, it was at 51,000 to free cash in 2022. Fiscal year 23, 66,600 about, and it's going to be about the same for fiscal year 24. So, question, I guess, for the committee is, you know, is that useful to have that much going to free cash continuously that, you know, two years in a row, fiscal year 24 would be three years. Yes. So, my thought would be to tell them that it's a blessing for them to do this. That if they don't get the current chair, get it back together and let them hire somebody, we won't carry it forward and they'll have to come back as a separate request when they finally get hired. It just seems crazy. So, we will label this use or lose? If I could. Yeah. One of the things that they had mentioned it, they being not the board itself, but a number of years ago when COVID-19 hit and we had, then the board administrator was out sick, if you remember. Well, it ended up, they only had one person, none of the staff was out on maternity leave. So, they only ended up having one person in the selectors office working. And then, to my understanding is that chairman at that time was concerned not to, if something happened, they'd have to hire at least a part-time. Right. There hasn't been a part-time, in my memory, that part-time position has been vacant. I remember the lady that used to work there. Yeah. And then, what they did do, though, is when she left, they hired Ashley Mott part-time. She had a position between the board and the building above. And then, when she became full-time, they left that position open. And that's great. We're just prepping right now. So, with three people. So, they did use a part-time position. I think it was a few hours last year when Marie passed and then one of the office personnel was on leave. So, you only ended up with one person in the office. And instead of filling the position, they just used some of the money to hire a part-time position for a while. For a very short time. So, they like to have that flexibility. Again, we have never spoken directly to any of the selectors. Right. We only talk to the board administrator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's selected. It's a great area. The reason I bring it up is so when I first joined the finance committee, I went to Ruth to review the comptroller's budget. And I found out that there was a $65,000 line item in the middle of Ruth's budget that she never spent. It was for like telephone switches. We didn't have telephone switches. And I was like, well, Ruth, why do you have this here? And she's like, well, if I zero it, it's just gonna get spent somewhere else. And she's like, so I've decided as a financial best practice not to spend it. And I was like, okay. And so then one of the things I, it was funny when she said it, right? One of the things I tended to appreciate for that discussion is the way we budget is we give these people caps of 3% for out there this or that or the other thing. So, if you remove it, it's just gonna go at, they'll just have a position somewhere else. If you're actually not saving the taxpayers any money, you're not saving the government any money, you're not leading to any greater efficiency, you're just gonna transfer the costs somewhere else, right? And so why I say that is over the years, especially with schools, like last year, they've had trouble spending all their money and it's been dropping out into free cash. Never really bothered me because it doesn't seem like you wanna force someone to spend money.</blockquote>

But I think my question, or at least our question in bringing this up is just so that we are aware of it, because if they decide to fill it, that's 66,000 that's gonna disappear from free cash, which is maybe not that much and we'll notice, but it's not.

And that big red number is totally not real because these guys are turning in $66,000 a year. So as long as everybody here agrees not to panic about the big red number five years out, fine. Otherwise, get it off the page so that we don't have a big red number suddenly smaller. That's gonna be it. So end of rant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess she gave us the number. So maybe fiscal year 24, she was thinking it would be about the same, but fiscal year 24 is the first time it was dropped to 0.54. So the 66,600 was from fiscal year 23, when it was still a 1.0. So yes, so she was saying it, she was expecting it to be the same as fiscal year 23, what she's looking at, but maybe it won't be as much, because now this is dropped, so. So maybe they've already kind of compromised it, or in a sense that they've cut it by half. I don't know, if it's in fact, a half-time position that's unfilled, it's... Right, so, but it's like, even though it's vacant every year, it goes... Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. Standard process, standard process, thank you. But when you first noticed this, it was a full-time position. Yes, and so it's continuing to be vacant, but they've reduced the hours. It was, right, fiscal year 22, fiscal year 23, vacant as a full-time position. Fiscal year 24 is the first time it was vacant as a 0.54 position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, Dean? I'll pass. This is kind of, sort of, again, another standard practice in all of the salary details. We all have vacant positions. Many of them don't go, I shouldn't say we all, but there's many vacant positions that either don't get filled or that they juggle around. So I think it's kind of standard practice, it seems to me. So correct me, but it seems like that's kind of what we do. Given that it is a position that has been decreased in hours, I'm not concerned about it myself, but I think it's something to continue to watch. I think it may reach a point where adding what you're arguing becomes more powerful. But at this point, since the hours seem to be tracking and not stable at the whole time or expanding.</blockquote>

This is sounding like it's more of a contract job for part of the year. I suppose we could leave it as a vacant position, but if they're only using 30% of an FTE, what do they think about dropping it to 0.3 rather than 0.54? I would say it's also, we've asked what this position does. I think we asked them that last year too. Their idea is if it were filled, it's to help with town day and overflow with traffic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it traffic committee? Yeah, the board of tech. The tech, they call it tech. So it's to help with those specific thing. There is the big 250th anniversary coming up. So they didn't feel the need to fill it yet, but maybe as work picks up on that 250th anniversary. We just ended, the reason we were bringing it up is because when you just look at the report, salaries looks like it's just going down 2.71% but then there's a situation that was worth clarifying for everybody going forward. So if, should we just keep going down the numbers still? Yep, yeah. Longevity, no big change really, but it's just over the years, Marie left and she had the biggest longevity and now it's just small increases every year. Longevity just sort of as a refresher, it's 1% five to nine years in, 2% 10 to 14 years in, 3% 15 to 19 years in, and then you're maxed out at 5%. The line for advertising hasn't changed. It's the cost of the legal notices for private ways, liquor license, marijuana licenses, all that. The 5215 telephone is the one telephone line for the board administrator. Dues and subscriptions, they're expecting actually a modest increase in that. That's not reflected here because this number is based on the bill they got last summer. This summer's bill will be higher with an increase of 2.5%. She said to go ahead and keep this 13,000 in, but we're expecting to see the increased number this year, but she's decided to keep it at 13,000 this year and it will increase next year. And that's just a reflection of the bill that comes in for the dues and subscriptions. They can't control that. Office supplies increased, obviously, once everybody came back to the office from the years and otherwise unclassified is more for gifts for retiring members, for example. And historically, since we see some numbers under otherwise unclassified, it used to be for printing article, the warrant printing, but that's been moved to another line item in the budget. So if you're looking at historical figures, that is quite set page. And the audit reports, this is, we discussed this in the past. They don't, the comptroller handles it, but it's under the select word budget. And we asked why they keep budgeting 78,000, even though it's about 10,000 less. But that's just what they do. That figure came when not the current comptroller, but with the rich, I can't think of his last name. He suggested at that time when the comptroller would come under the jurisdiction of the Board of Selectmen, he suggested that increase at $78,000, which they did the following year. And it's been that way since. So maybe, it seems to go up every year a little bit when you look at the actuals. I think it'll be a while before it gets to 78,000, but.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the simple answer is, when Rich Vista became comptroller, he started issuing an annual comprehensive financial report the first year in order to move to the ACI part of his additional work, and because it was additional work, it was an additional bill. So he stuck the larger number in there, and then he just kept it there forever. So another. But that's not what it costs now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean? So we're kind of hitting on it twice. I'll make this statement. So professionally speaking, use or lose budgeting is a road to disaster. Okay. It is the worst thing you can do. Any kind of hit it, but I'll hit it the way it actually plays out. Okay. When you tell people, if you don't use it, you lose it, they use it. And so one of the interesting things we have at Arlington is we have all of these large returns back to free cash. If you don't spend it and you don't lose it, what will happen if we draw a hard line and say, you're going to lose it, you're going to lose it. People will do what they always do. Right. What happens right now is you pull it. When you hear this, Q1X, which is July 1, September 30th, 25% of the budget doesn't get spent. All the salaries do, but the expenses go. Q2, same thing. Q3, same thing. Then at the end, they figure out how much money they have to do some additional spending, things like that. Right. If we draw too hard of a line, people will get to Q4 and spend the entire budget and they will draw it to zero. And you'll see the precipitous decline in free cash because, hey, I'm going to lose my money if I don't get it. When I need it, I'm not going to have it. So I'm going to go use, and you're not going to spend it on good things. You're going to spend it on kind of gross things. Right. And we like to think in our head that as a finance committee, we can fix that and we can manage that and all that. We end up doing the better thing, which is we don't beat people to death over these returns, these large things. And then we have some like any sets, a little drama that occurs where we say the plan's going to run out in three years and all hell's going to freeze over and then, oh, found money, now it's another year. Oh, found money, now it's another year. That's a better way to do it than to actually run out of money in year three because people were spending every last second so they didn't lose it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the basic issue here is the, and Dean made an allusion to it before, the sluggish budget and all the other budgets in the town side are under this, I guess, three and a quarter percent growth cap. It's too high. And we're taxing people that we shouldn't be taxing. That's the issue. And if the growth rate were more realistic, then we wouldn't have this problem. And the town manager and department managers can better manage their budget within a realistic set of bounds. I'm just wondering if they should spend money in appropriating this line item to be used for anything other than the audit reports. I don't think it has historically. I'm just wondering whether they could use it to buy more pencils or whether they can. Because these are the beautiful, thick, ACNR Washington brochures, which I don't think are produced by the auditor. I think they're out of print. I would like to see a reduction because they probably don't need as many printed copies as they used to. And in the world of electronics, I don't know that they even have. Right. It seems like they're putting out fewer copies. I know it's inexpensive. Right. I think when we were talking about that, oh, maybe this is 60. I think when looking at the select board's budget, it's sometimes different than looking at other departments where there's so much going on in some of the projects. This is just basically salaries and an audit report. There's no activity projects being. So it's not like at the end of the year, they're looking to spend it on something and we cut down. I think it's different than other budgets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think this might be an exception to what you're saying. How many of these are you going to buy? 10 more? Right. There's nothing for them to spend the money. I mean, if they're sending 66,000 in fiscal year 2023, yeah. If we did decide that this would be a good example of a place to spend a little bit, we should probably be consistent with all the other budgets. We want to make that kind of statement. I think that's a very good point, that if we do it for this budget, we must do it for all of the budgets. Look for opportunities to squeeze a little bit.</blockquote>

How much of that? And that's something that we- Right. And I think in each instance, we'd have to say, is this money that could be spent on buying more pencils that year to fill the cabinet? Or is this money that was specifically for this thing and you really couldn't add it? You couldn't add extra at the end of the year. It was kind of maybe one purchase, for example. We can maybe do that with our own budget because we generally don't spend as much as we might. Grant? Thank you. Grant, Carol, please. Just a quick one, I just wanted to. So this is the type of thing I've observed over the years. And Michael, this is sort of you probably have the same as Tom meeting. You spend a lot of time scrutinizing the smaller budgets and the larger budget just get passed like that. So I don't know, I kind of like, maybe we can encourage some of the larger sized budgets.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carol? But yeah, I mean, part of the reason I like doing this now and early is because it sets the bar for how we're looking at budgets going forward. But you're right. We do, he's correct. We do squibble over $8,000 versus $800,000. Million. You know, consistently. If they're not, they don't have anything else to spend it on. So it's not like they're gonna go spend it on something else. Charlie, and then you. I believe that the question was asked, can they spend this money on something else? I believe under the bylaw, the town department managers can spend expenses from one budget and then another budget. The town comptroller has instituted a new charter of counts to make the spending clearer. But I don't believe that there's a regulation that says you can not move money from one category to another without requiring any approval other than the local department manager. So I guess that my suggestion would be, as much as I took a hard line on this position, but it irritates me that the slug forward chair will never fill. It's possible for these conversations to be friendly conversations. It would be possible to, if not this year, because you've already met with them, next year when you meet with them, say, hey, we see a pattern where you don't actually spend $78,000, but if you cut that to 70 and you won't have a problem, you wanna recalibrate, are you sure you want this money? And then if they say, no, no, no, we don't wanna give it up, oh, well. But you can at least ask the question. Yes, this figure is not calculated in the selectors office. They just kind of accept this. It comes from the comptroller. So if we're having a conversation, it's the comptroller that we should have a conversation. And whoever's talking to the comptroller, should talk to the comptroller. And whoever's talking to the comptroller should talk to the comptroller about it.</blockquote>

Assuming we don't want that money in the world to free cash and so on and so forth.

The other point, the main point that I would make is that we have already had our meeting with Ida Cody, the comptroller, but this was not on her budget sheet, and we didn't discuss it. But we'll go back and talk to her and find out what her opinion is. And it's not clear to me, while it's in her budget, it's not clear to me that the, I don't know who actually makes a decision that says we're gonna use these auditors or we're gonna go out and get a competition going between three potential auditors and see who comes back with the lowest bid.

Because it gets included in the capital plan, so it does get reprogrammed. I would argue probably more productively than if some department has some arbitrary time limit that they have to spend it. And I absolutely concur with Dean having seen it for, you know, I've been in the public sector my entire career, and that the use or lose is one of the stupidest victims that you get because Dean is absolutely right. It's under pressure having to spend money or lose it in their budget the next year. Some terrible decisions get made. Short-sighted and, you know, ultimately wasteful, not deliberately, but the net effect is. So to me, letting the unspent money flow into pre-cash that can then get reprogrammed to the capital plan, I think is actually a pretty good system.</blockquote>

In the clerk's office, and also in the registrar's office a few years ago, they lost positions exactly because they didn't carry them. And the registrar's office now was down to one person. It used to be two and a half. The clerk's office is down a half a position that they never got back. So those are examples of what happens if you say, I don't need it anymore, or they're gonna take it away from you. Going back to the Board of Selectmen, just to put in information, if you will, this part-time that they hired to fill in was actually a retiree that used to do the town day lineup. And they brought her back for this recent town day and do all the paperwork and all the set up that required. That's quite a job to begin with. They brought her back and she was willing to come back, but that's the person that filled that position. I don't know if that's gonna happen this coming year for town day, I don't know.

I think use it or lose it is a bad thing for office supplies or ammunition or something where you can just buy now and do it later. But when it comes to a position or what we pay the auditor, I just don't think that that problem applies to those cases. So if we see something where it looks like money has been budgeted that never gets spent, I think we have to look at specifically what sort of money that is. Is it for one big purchase that happens every year and it always comes under budget? Or is it for office supplies? They can just, oh, we gotta buy some more of that. So each line can be treated individually.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you asked for a suggestion, but before I offer one, can we suspend the outpost so I don't assign myself work? No. So speaking of the audit, every audit has a reconciliation of budget to actual. It's actually a printed statement. And so what you can do, I have it open on my computer right now, is you can actually look and see every department that underspec their budget. So we're talking about the select board right now, not for fiscal 23, but for fiscal 22, they underspent their budget by 74,000. So you can actually see that position and the audit just translate right into here. So if we wanted to get a better understanding of budget underspending in the various departments, we have a roadmap, like we have a document that says this is where money is exactly underspent. And we could just kind of go through it and it wouldn't take that long to figure out comprehensively how it worked. And then you'd find yourself, you at least you'd have an outcome where in understanding it, you have treated everybody equal, right? You haven't created an environment where if we were good enough to remember to ask someone about it, we got it. If we weren't good enough to find it, we didn't get it. And lo and behold, this isn't gonna be very surprising to anybody, but police was the biggest turn back in fiscal 22, as example, they turned back 465,000. That was the biggest single turn back. Treasurer turned back 210 that year, et cetera, et cetera. So that just kind of totals it up. So I would say, rather than like kind of hunting after each department and making them kind of deal with it, we could just administratively look at this schedule and then just kind of ask, you look it over, you'd line them up over four years and see if the same departments are turning back large sums every year. And then you would know it's a reoccurring issue. And yes, I will do it next week. I think we also need to keep another thing in mind. It's this thing called COVID. And so there were across the board and every industry, every job, every office, every organization, people, we could not find people from positions. So the police there, it's not like they'll take anyone off the street. So I would expect and kind of am glad that there are some turn backs to the police department and fire department because we just can't, we don't want to hire anyone to take these positions. A lot of these positions, it's been a lot of turnover in the last few years. So I think we have to keep that in mind while we're looking at these budgets today that things have happened in the last few years. So I think it's good for us to think about these things and the tension between use it, lose it, being a bad idea, but also being honest with the taxpayer that no, it's really not gonna be an override in 2027 because we'll just be able to find money. And I don't know where the sweet spot is, but having data, I think will be helpful keeping this in mind. And as we go through the other budgets, I think we should do this online as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh? I have a question, I guess, in other organizations I've been in, I don't know if municipal finance allows it, is it possible to have like a top of the house vacancy number that says that we're setting aside a million, 2 million, whatever vacancies across the organization. So there's no pressure for anybody to hire to spend it just because they can't have it, but the town manager has some discretion. I don't know that that has been an issue in the past. Departments like saying, look how much money I saved. No, no, but I guess like in this particular budget, if they're 20% under what they budgeted, and as a taxpayer, I say, oh, geez, the whole town budget there is 20% padded. So what are they doing there? That just seems funny to me. That just seems funny to me. So I think that I would be comfortable with a percentage, but 20% seems very excessive to me. So I was asking my original question, just if you don't wanna have user lose it or any pressure like that, if there's some expectation, if you get a jam, we're gonna be able to help you out because we have this funding, or in general, again, organizations a lot of times will say, we know that people wanna hold onto their positions, we know that people wanna hold onto their positions, but we really, we're never gonna fill them all, even without COVID. And so we've got this number here, we've got a 5% vacancy factor for our salary figure. That guy. It'd be interesting to see if other towns do something like that.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 187</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I agree with you. And we'd have to, so for example, the least turn back I can almost guarantee is because of vacancies that they can't fill not with a lack of trying. Yeah. So we'd have to look at each of those and sort of not paint with a broad brush that, oh, this is department's pattern. And if the police chief finds him or herself with the ability to fill those positions, then you need to make sure that they have the money to do that. But that would like, for that, I'm sorry, but like an overtime adjustment would perhaps correct that issue. I don't know about that. I mean, they're probably spending more on overtime because they've got all these vacancies. Yeah, they are. Yeah. But again, they can't just get people off the street. There's the whole civil- No, I'm just saying if they got all these vacancies and suddenly they actually hire those people, so their overtime costs are gonna go down and their salaries are gonna go up and it might kind of balance each other out. Theoretically, yeah.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I wanted to make a comment too about Dave's remark about reductions in staff in the clerk's office and the registrar's office and maybe some other offices. For years, we've been looking for benefits of investing in technology and software and things like that. For example, when a principal clerk typists, how many offices have typists now? Well, that's sort of a profession that's gone away in a buggy whip. And I'm hoping that as we're investing in Office 365 and other databases, like the clerk's office isn't using file cards anymore. I think they're finally using computers. And sort of expect the benefit of that to be a reduction in staff over time. So I just like to consider that in positions where investments in capital equipment and software may reduce staff requirements without any loss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I'm just telling you what happens, it's fact. It increases. And some of the things, let me just give you an example. Printing, now you would think in today's world that we wouldn't have to go to the advocate that really doesn't exist, but we have to print certain zoning and certain bylaws and all that. That's not governed by us. That's governed by state law. So even though we have a quasi newspaper, we still have to print because the law says we have to. So we have no control over that. And that would have to be, wouldn't it be a heck of a lot simpler if you could just go in the computer and say, here's this stuff. But the law says, no, it's gonna be printed in the paper. I'm just throwing that there's a whole, I'm an IT guy, there's a whole line of factor, but when I see typist in someone's title, I say, who uses typist? But that's just, that's just, okay.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie? So I think there's a couple things going on here. So first of all, I don't think we can make a hard and fast rule about any of this. I think it's about getting to know your department heads, how they think, what their goals are, so on and so forth. I would put pressure on this particular position in the select board's office. I know how that office runs, and I know they don't need the position. And I know exactly what they do need, which is they do need a contractor. We never put pressure on the police department about four or five vacancies because of that cycle, how they feel, and also because we know we underpay our police officers and then move to other towns to make more money, and so on and so forth. So you're expecting a constant vacancy there. So I think it becomes about understanding your department head's budget and seeing what you can persuade your department head to consider. It would think there are ways that you are efficient in terms of their budget requests. Because what happens with budgets is that, I can take this year's numbers, we add 3% to them and we roll them forward because we know that those are the rules, okay? So if you didn't think of it as use it or lose it, but you thought of it as zero basic budget, start every year fresh and build it back up, but what do I really need? Which is a very tedious and difficult process, okay? Then you would begin to see some of this fall out. And the objective there wouldn't necessarily be to get underneath the cap. It would be that there may be other things, modern services we wanna provide that we don't because there's $78,000 in the select board's budget that they're turning back when the clerk needs to add a half-time position. That's the difficulty for me. Not that we are overspending, but that there are things we don't do because we say we don't have the money when in fact that money's turning back to free cash. So, and then this unrealistic picture for the public of what's coming in five years, which is never what we predicted. And you can watch it drop year after year. Not that you're ever gonna get year five correct. So all I'm saying is think about this when you're talking to your department heads. I certainly think about it when I'm talking to mine. And those are the kind of questions that we ask. What are you not doing that you need to do, okay? And how did you get that change in your total salary this year? You know, just how's it working?</blockquote>

It comes from curiosity of saying how much is going to free crap? And who is depending on this money? Because if they do fill it, and that disappears from free cash, is that a shock to those who are planning something with that free cash? So just to be open. I think the select board is also difficult for us because we don't meet with the chair of the select board. We meet with the board administrator who really isn't the one making the decisions. Because nobody takes their calls.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can help you with that. Charlie? Thank you, Madam Chair. Following Alan's comment about efficiencies, typists versus computer operators, et cetera. I was on the capital planning committee for a long time. And I always heard narratives from our managers that they needed this better fire truck or this better public works vehicle or these better computers because it was more efficient. And many times, the implication was that the personnel force would, the personnel level would not be quite as high. In fact, what has always happened is that the amount of services delivered to the community increased and used that money. And so if there's gonna be any savings from improved technology, whether it's in vehicles or office equipment or other tools, that direction has to come from the top, the town manager and the board of selectmen or the school committee or the superintendent that says that this is the level of services we're gonna provide at this cost or at a lower cost or whatever.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we're talking about the Board of Selections office and it's a different setup. We're talking to the board administrator. It sounds like the board administrator doesn't have a decision making authority. Do we pray for power or do we pray for serenity? It's limited because they are elected officials. It's a different setup when you're dealing with elected officials rather than appointed officials. And we have never met. I've been on this committee for I forget how many years and we've never met. I'm asking why can't we go forward? I've been asking that question myself. To be honest with you, I don't even know if the Board of Selections are aware of this discussion about vacancy or not vacancy. It's brought to their attention, but like Sophie said, it's passed on to the next year, to the next year, to the next year. That's an issue in and of itself. It's different when you're dealing with elected officials versus appointed officials. I can tell you that. My first experience, I think the first year on the board, we raised some questions on the salaries and couldn't get a call back from the chair. Right. That's true. We wanted to speak to the chair this year, but no. We know where they live. And we know where they sleep. Maybe also, maybe things can change now. With Marie no longer here, unfortunately. But maybe she had a certain power over the office. So it's the change of guard. Right. So maybe we could change the guard and get back in. And tell us how much the chair got involved in the budget. So I think it varied by chair. Right. I didn't try to get involved in the budget. I had a 10 minute conversation with Marie and said, we really need all these people. And she said, get out of my office. I do know that Kevin was very, very specific about wanting to preserve certain things. So he may have had more of a line. But I don't think that that's a reason not to try and have a conversation with. In order to ask them to be at your meeting. That just may be a reason that they defend the budget. If you had asked when I was chairing, if you had said to me, we need you in this budget meeting, I would have showed up. If you had then said to me, we need to do 10 things. And Marie said, no, we don't. I probably would have gone. But I wish. So I think you should at least be able to get your calls. And if you have trouble getting your calls. I can tell you that. I don't know who those people are. It's quite. A number of years ago, I made phone calls. The chairman. Trying to get a hold of that. And it never happened. I even tried to have the office staff in the selection's office, get a hold of that chairman. And although they spoke to the chairman and they said, they were kind of looking for you and here's this number. That didn't happen. Please tell me I wasn't chair. I just want to remind people. That. Every office in town. Must give us the information that we request. Now I hate to go nuclear. But if we get frustrated. I feel like it is within our power to say. Fine. I'm not going to go nuclear. I'm not going to do it at all. And tell town meeting why. And then we'll see what would tell me. And you can buy your own motion. Substitute your budget. You want to go to the humiliation. I love saying that you have given. You have. Treated us this way. But I don't think we ever have to get to that point. So. I don't know. With their department head. Let's bring it to the committee and talk about it. Because we have. It is our right under the bylaw. If we ask for it, they must give it to us. So. I'm not comfortable with the fact that when we. You will be approaching them about this particular issue. Going forward. I think. At that point. Maybe they'll understand that. One more communication next year. And. The incoming. Chair. Someone who understands how the finance committee works. We can do all of ours or we can, I know libraries are some other ones. We're ready to go. No. So if I could. Excuse me. Can we get this only one done? I say small. I know it's. They're small sometimes. Yeah, I know. Can you guys hear me? I can't hear you. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Okay. No, it's fine. Okay. So we can do all of ours or we can, I know libraries are some other ones. We're ready to go. No. So if I could. Can we get this only one done? Let's do. I say smaller. They're small sometimes. Okay. Okay. I had a telephone conversation with the. But there's only. It comes under the building inspectors. If you remember, I guess. The position. Is only an administrator. Used to be a part-time position. Nightmares thing. Personally, it's now. Point eight, nine position, which is. Considered. Responsibilities. So, you know, it's, it's. It's this person now. We're in another location. That's why you see. In the salary. The longevity. 443. It's because this person has worked. In other areas. Within the building department. Yeah. So that's. That's what the figure is. The. The. The last few years. With the hearings. If somebody. Request information on past hearings. Printing office supplies. But now. Within. Currently in last year. It's leveled off as far as. The office support is now stable. It wasn't stable before. In and out. They brought back a retiree. And. The workload is. Dramatically increased. Does not require. A point eight, nine position. So that's basically it. Total is 76,723. And we only have that one. Employee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to the next one. Go to register. Next page. Okay. So elections and salaries. As we've discussed every year this is based on the number of elections that happens in that fiscal year so there will always be fluctuations. So this is a year so Julie was reminding us 2024 budget was for two elections an override and a town election. 2025 budget there's an election in September, November, April. So we're at three. The 2024 budget though was actually just for one election even though we had two because I think she said she hadn't budgeted for the override. So I'm a little surprised. And I think Tara reported an email earlier tonight before the meeting that so Julie's expecting the 2024 number to be too low actually. Which is a separate issue over this budget. So she will need a transfer as an aside regarding 2024 most likely. At some point. At some point. So overtime also the 5103 line is having to do with let's say the past few elections as well. But she's not counting any for this year. The expenses being 5221 the electronic voting equipment has to be the 21 machines. There's 21 machines but we're talking about the voting pads. And there's one that 5221 so there is an increase from last year. That's the increased cost plus the town meeting clickers are included in that number. So that's a contract. And every year under the contract there's an increase for those clickers. So that's why that number will increase every year under that line. Office supplies stays fairly consistent. Printing ballots. There's an increase. So that's also for the increase in the number of elections I believe. The fact that there's more ballots. What was interesting in the printing of ballots that Julie said is the town of Arlington has about 50% mail-in ballots I think. In early voting. But she still needs to print enough ballots for voting in person for every registered voter. Because she, not quite, I mean she under counts a little bit. But she cannot find herself in a position of running out of ballots. And so she throws away a lot of ballots after the election. But that's just the cost and the waste that has to be built into the system. And the other purchase services, line 5236, that is a significant increase. And that has to do with the coding in the machines. We hold the ballots. So the more ballots and elections we have, the more the coding costs go up. Because you have to hold those ballots. So that is, this year that's $15,000 for the coding versus last year $7,000 for the coding. And that ties into those numbers. And also, again we're going to have early voting for the presidential primary. And also for the November election. And the presidential primary, at this point, will have early voting a week. Presidential election, two weeks of early voting. So that's coming from the Secretary of State. I don't think she's going to use as much personnel as she had to use in the past. But that number will be finally unknown. To go back to what I had just said about the $15,000 versus $7,000 for coding. You'll notice that's actually more than a $4,000 increase. Which is only showing a $4,000 increase. The reason for that is because last year the number included $3,000 for visually impaired accessibility. That $3,000 is now being covered by the state, which was the hope. So that's why we're only going up four instead of going up four. Because we have $3,000 that used to be used for something else. Are you going to make a motion? Yes, we can now make a motion. I move to approve the election budget of $278,704.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where did the $52,019 cost items for day and election workers? $52,019, I'm just trying to look at the history of that. It hasn't been in here. Poll worker salaries, I think she now puts it into salaries and wages. Yeah, that's my question. There's a breakdown of salaries and wages. I don't think we've ever had a breakdown of salaries and wages. Because it is just for the poll workers. There is no employee in elections. There is a term that they use for employees that work the election. I should know what they work the election. But they get paid. Right, they get paid. Some choose not to get paid. I just found that out last year. Some choose to volunteer their time while others get paid. Some of this is also historically things. When Julie came in, things were put into line items where they didn't really belong. And she cleaned house and put things in the right categories. So I think there used to be line items here, but it didn't make sense. She moved it up to where it was supposed to be, salaries. So we don't have an answer as to where that cost is? The cost is in the salaries and wages. That's the time for the poll workers. She said before it's a per-election cost. It's different every fiscal year based on the number of elections. Those are the election workers. Since we have new members, a reminder for those that were new last year. There is a reimbursement system by the state. So this is the true cost of the elections that we budget. But then there's a reimbursement that goes into the general fund from the state. But we never know what that number is until after the fact. So we conservatively don't budget for any. And that comes out of the state audit. Those are free cash? So we're extra cash, but we're free.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alec Jones, do you have anything else? I'll take it. My question was going to be where's the breakdown of salaries and wages that the budget has. I understand what happened is it got removed from expenses to salaries. And there's no compensatory breakdown. A breakdown of salaries and wages would give us some idea of an income change. What she told us last year. We didn't ask about this year. But the last year, it's so dependent on the number of elections. That every year there's a breakdown. It would be nice to know this year it's going to take 57 workers instead of 20. So I'll think about that. And then historically too, now that she has the full pass that the election workers lose. There's less overtime because things go faster. So there's the increased cost of the technology, but then an increase in overtime to those election workers. There's something under that. And then as an aside for those dealing with facilities and the other budgets. Traditionally, she's always used the lion's room. I guess for counting the ballots and doing all the ballots. Also for storage of the ballots and all that. So the situation of the conditions of Town Hall are affecting how our Town Hall is working. The lion's room is by Florence. So what was the plan? Just a picture of a big yellow table. I think she's planning on using part of the Select Board's office. I don't think they know it yet. It can't be away from the Clerk's office. They've got to be within some type of distance. Because the Clerk's keeps on going. It's a big open space. And now it's happening in the Selectman's room now. The Selectman's room. You look up and you say, oh. Well, I smell. The smell in the Select Board meeting room from the water damages. They have fans on constantly. So there's an extra election in 2020 March. There's an extra election. Compared to 2024. In the 2024 number here, there were two. But the budget was for one. Why doesn't the ballots go up more? Because the number of voters don't go up. And the ballots for a general election. It's paid for by the state. The ballots for our elections. We pay for it. When you said something about coding ballots. Not in budget. But that's a cool process. What does that mean? You have the ballots that you fill in. Each time you have an election. That looks different. And you have to code it. Oh, okay. Right. The more elections. The more ballots. The more. I have to figure it out. It's not a manual thing.</blockquote>

Get new mailings. So last year she told us for printing census. New mailings for not returning the census. Something the office had started last year. And so that's a lot of paper. And hopefully. Catch on that it's. They should turn in their census. And they'll have fewer reminders to send out. Or new mailings for the fact that they didn't. They don't send it in. They get. And all that. So. They go on. And someone says to you. You can vote. But you're on the inactive list. You have to step aside. The one has to take some information. It's very quick. And the people. So why is that? You didn't fill out the census. So. Basically that's what you're doing with the form. So it goes back on who you are. And where you are. So she had added the reason there was an increase in the actual. For me there is because she added an additional mailing. Did not return your census. So that you wouldn't have this issue. Trying to get people to turn them in. With the idea that in a few years. People will realize they should fill it out the first time. Instead of waiting to get the reminder. But she's not there yet.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legal expenses. So, this is where there's a lot of stuff that's usually covered in here. The lawyers don't take the time to detail out everything that's in here. It's just one big bucket. So, historically, what's been explained is in the 52-44 expenses, you have your bar dues, your bar association dues, your legal databases, your court fees, filing fees, office supplies, travel, unclassified, such as having court reporters, or usually the Zoning Board of Appeals or the police dog hearings, and outside counsel. And outside counsel is where the biggest chunk of the money goes. So, we had some updates based on the previous year's budget. There was a police case that's where a big chunk of the money was going, and that's been resolved. That issue has been resolved. That outside counsel fee is not carried over or budgeted for the next fiscal year. So, that was about it. Yeah, we also asked the different things that might come about as far as legal matters. One was issues of the public works, and there are no issues now. There was possibility of some type of contamination. They had warned us last year that there would maybe be something in the future for the DPW, potential exposure, but they haven't had to do that. And there was an issue of contamination up at Poets' Corner when there was a discussion going on between the Aztec-Austin and Delmont Hills as far as the joint venture. Well, then, no one at the Delmont Hills went through with their plans. Last year, when we asked them about heads up and things, those were things they had told us to watch out for, but actually haven't come through. And we also asked them about the house that their offices are, the Javis house on the street. Because we had a discussion last year about the conditions of that piece of property. And the town council told us that through CPA funding, they received a sizable amount of money to start a full grant for work inside the building. The first thing they're going to build is on air conditioning, and as a result, over years, the building swells and is sinking, so they're going to go after that. The first pile of money for air conditioning and straightening that out. And if they need more funding, they'll go back to the CPA and ask for more. He was quite pleased with the size of the dollar. He didn't give me the dollar amount, but he said that it was sizable. That's definitely good news this year as opposed to last year when we met with them and there was nothing in the pipeline and everything looked pretty bleak as far as the state of that house from exterior to interior, so that's good news. The house is not actually owned by the town of Allington, but I guess there's been an agreement in place since Paul Revere wrote up Mass Ave, I guess I don't know. The town of Allington would keep the house, maintain the house, and there's a working agreement. Who owns it? It's been affected. The owner of the property behind it?</blockquote>

How much did they, how much work did they do on the water and sewer? I'm sure he didn't ask it. And I bet they won't answer, but it's a foreshadowing because it's 121, and it went up, went up three and a half percent. Well, I, so conversations with Sandy. I understand the conversations with Sandy. And Sandy's no longer here. Right. But I'm wondering if there's some, some way that you can probe and say, Hey, how much work did you do for the water and sewer? I think we should be able to ask that. But he doesn't work for me. Well, he's the man. I understand. That's why it's foreshadowing. I do plan on asking him, but Sandy had explained to me that it's just mathematical calculations. Well, that's right. So, I mean, I can have formulas and he has, he had a big formula when I asked him, and he said, last year he said it was in the works to review the formulas and the allocation among the departments.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds good. I, and again we talked about doing that. But there's two different things in play here it's easy just to say, well, it's a calculation. It's a calculation based on what they do. So, and I understand, you know, I've been through the study was done over 12 years ago. And it didn't explain how they came up with the ratios, but how they come up with the ratios. Might have something to do with how much time they spent on it, or maybe it doesn't, maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe they don't really have to do any work, I guess. And that's what we might hear from the manager. You don't really have to, they just allow you. Yeah, well. Michael, I think you had a hand up. Yeah, I've never met a lawyer who didn't know how much money was going out in the office, or somebody for work that that lawyer couldn't do himself first. No, I mean, I think when you drill down the expenses, they can. I don't have in my notes for the from last year. I don't know about this year, but. They just don't line item all of these expenses, partially because of the budget. They're anticipating where things are going to be in what kinds of cases are going to come up where they'll need outside counsel. So, at the budgeting process. For the next year, it's just a. I guess that whether they're going to need environmental attorneys. Or labor attorneys. It goes up, it goes down, it's like snow plowing. We can't tell. They, the reason last year, so we knew about the, they had given us a heads up last year about there's a police case, we'll probably have to keep budgeting for that. And then it turned out this year, they said, oh, no, it's been resolved. So that's why there's a decrease. So, they sort, they try and anticipate, they alert us. This year to any substantial increase needed. This budget, but there may be that we won't know until until when it comes up and then we're outside. It seems a question that comes up frequently in town. How much is X, Y, Z case costing us. In addition to the salaries and office. So, it's in this number and I'm sure a town meeting. They can say such cases costing us. Such, but that's a historical number, right? And we're looking at a budget future and that. We don't know because we haven't filled yet. We don't know what's going to settle. Seems to me that there are sorts of categories there and they're probably being tracked in units. Yes, we suggest they put everything in expenses. Is there nothing? My understanding is that all those just under general category expenses. Explain to somebody about that. Yeah. And the whole scheme of things that we. We're not, it's mostly upside down. It's mainly dues are a couple hundred, right? Dues are a couple hundred legal databases are sort of a set number for your West law searches to look up cases to look up all that kind of stuff. It's just sort of set numbers. Your big thing is outside counsel. You get them to do two months. We could get them to do more. You know, in the past, I don't have it in my notes here, but they have said, which firms they tend to use the one or two firms. They tend to go back to labor. Certain firms have certain expertise. One is contract negotiations. They did happen, but I know the property, as we all know, there'll probably be another 10 years. Yeah, breaking it out. Breaking it into different lines. Somebody should have the data. I don't think it really impacts this budget at all. Any other questions. I'm just curious about this. I noticed that the new town council has a step. But the old town council did not. Right, because he's new to the position. So I think it just covers a partial. So you reach the max. Until you meet 50% of the max, and then you don't get a step.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first blind salaries and wages. So there's an increase. We asked a question following up on the office manager position, because that went up when, in fact, last year we were told that it would. They were going to try and hire at a lower level. That they weren't able to, and it got put off to HR and just at the higher numbers with HR. Even in order to hire somebody for the position. So. There was. And then the longevity is just the. Decrease from the change. From. The previous year because the last year's budget. The current planning director. The current planning director. Last year's budget started. Was already printed. So she was. There. Two weeks. I think when we interviewed her, she. She wasn't familiar with the budget and those numbers are. We're based on her predecessor. So that's why there's a change in longevity. Because that was her predecessors. In previous years. And if I could be on 5160, the stipends. That's a stipend that is paid for. Actually, they call it a stipend, but it. It's a fee that is charged for work done for the conservation. A private vendor. They do measurements or something for the conservation. So that's what that 825 is. And then. Expenses. The 52 or three last year, it was a desk this year. It's office equipment. $500. The auto allowance is. Or. For going around and looking at the sites, et cetera. And then. Employees and the types of. Specialties they have. Where they have to be accredited. The training similarly. So the training was a big increase. and the hope was that it would be to cover per diems and the stays in addition to the actual fees for the training. I think we were told this year, it's not actually what's happening. This is actually more training because they have noticed the town meeting members. I do want to be informed on issues, especially on zoning and planning and development. So they may want to make sure that the staff is equally as uplifted. And it's not the most town meeting members.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Can you explain the offsets in this budget? It says that buying from empty spaces. No, the offset. So for example, the conservation commission offset is for work done for the conservation commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same with all of those. It's work done by the planning development for those. Some of the CDBG funds are allowed to be used for administrative. Yes. So the CDBG budget. With the administrative offset, right? I think the school offset is work done for the school committee. That's a kind of shared position. Did that answer your question? Yes. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie and then Topher. Thank you, Madam Chairman, Madam Chair. So for example, in the recent discussions leading up to the town meeting for the zoning changes, there were obviously, I think there were consultants used to provide some of the input that that's worth. And there's been consultants used in other recent projects by the planning department. Where is money coming from for these consultants? I think we were talking before, I'm trying to say grants. They grant different planners. They have a number of different grants. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topher. Yes, Madam Chair. Other questions? Sometimes, I was gonna go back and say, if it's not grants, sometimes it's also a line item in the, I think in one of our other budgets, like expenses, like town meeting approves X amount. Well, one article. Right. So if it's not one, it's the other.</blockquote>

Can you do redevelopment three minutes? Yeah. All right. Go for it. It's 78. It's a one with a 50% increase. Yeah. The one question we had on redevelopment board, and did you get an answer in this one? You wanna wait to wait on this one? No, we can. I mean, folks have questions that we can answer, right? Because I just don't remember. This is on page 76. Right, 76. So it's the redevelopment board that comes under the direction of the planning director. Yeah.
