<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, tonight we have the town manager, the WTown manager, Jim Feeney and Alec McGee who will talk about your budget and answer other questions and talk about a few issues that have come up. So I'll just turn it over to you, Jim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Good evening, everyone. As the chair mentioned, I'm Jim Feeney. I am the town manager. With me tonight is Alex McGee, deputy town manager and finance director. No, many of you I know, and a few of you I've already met this evening, so good evening. Pleased to be here. Happy to have the time to walk you through the proposed fiscal year 2025 budget. Tonight we'll do an overview of the budget process, an overview of the high level of the budget itself, speak to some of what we'll call the budget highlights, including maintaining the board's override commitments and investments in response to community needs, review the long-term outlook, i.e. the long-range plan, as well as the next steps. And before I turn it over to Alex to go into the details, as Christine mentioned, as we circle around to the end of the presentation, review some of the new news that we've received, but it has been a bit of a, you know, what I'll say, a tumultuous budget season already. As many folks know, you know, this committee voted on prior to the special town meeting in the fall the issue with the fiscal year 2024 override. So, you know, we were starting in a position where we did not collect that $7 million in fiscal year 2024, instead pushing to fiscal year 2025. And then we initially received, you know, about a month ago, the news from the group insurance commission, the GIC, that we were going to see a significant premium rate increase this year on aggregate estimated between 8% and 10%. They don't hone in on that until early March. Needless to say, we generally carry a 5% increase there, and it's a very large budget. So that was, you know, an over $1 million hurdle that we've already dealt with. And as alluded to, the governor's budget, H2, did not bring the best of news for the town of Arlington. At the highest level we carried for chapter 70 state aid, we were projecting in the previously approved long range plan, a 5% growth rate on education aid, given what we had seen in recent years, and as a result of the ongoing implementation of the student opportunity act. However, that came in at roughly 1%. So that resulted in yet another sort of fiscal year 25 hit on the order of magnitude of about $650,000. It was actually a bigger hit on the education side, but we budgeted for 1% growth in unrestricted general government aid, and that actually came in at 3%, offsetting a bit of that shortfall or deficit. So just wanted to point out some of the hurdles that we know we're facing. We certainly don't yet have solutions for all of them, but look forward to certainly working with this committee to find our way through it. So I'll turn it to Alex to sort of talk through some of the specifics, and we'll be going back and forth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Next slide. Perfect. So a little bit about our budget processes. A lot of you are very likely aware, but some of you may not be, so we're going to run over it. This is a long endeavor. It takes a large portion of the fiscal year to complete our budget process work. I'd say probably like somewhere between 60 and 75% through the process at this point. So this starts really in earnest in August with our capital planning. We launch by asking our department heads to work within their departments to figure out what their capital needs are. They do a five year look out, and then they say, all right, this is what we want. We hope people bring their needs for five years out, and then as the plan moves forward through the years, we're able to meet those needs and fund them appropriately. Inevitably, we always have things that become critical, and so we have to reshuffle the deck every year, and so that involves the work of the Capital Planning Committee. The work in earnest is mostly November, December, and then there's a little bit of a lag, and then we begin sort of report building, starting really tomorrow is when that will kick off again. The operating budgets really start their development in earnest in sort of November, mid-October, November. Our department heads, we distribute materials to them, explain what situation, what we believe the situation to be for the next fiscal year to be, and so they plan for any new expense requests they may have, so what we call their ordinary expenses, it's not personnel related, and then we work together with all of our department heads to work on all of our personnel and salary sheets. Brings us to the January through April time frame. You all folks are beginning, they're sort of really into the teeth of your work now, dissecting all the departmental budgets. The budget was really put together by Town Manager, myself, Julie Wayman, who's our previous budget director, now is the Town's Treasurer, she's recently promoted, and Gail Dixon, who's our soon-to-be departing budget director. We can talk about that later, but so the budget was delivered January 12th to the Select Board and the FinCom Chair, and now you all are doing your work. Over the next couple of months, I'll be working in our office to develop the financial plan, which is sort of the bigger budget book that we all love, April's town meeting, and then hopefully we have a budget that is adopted and appropriated in May. Then at the end of June, we're turning the clock again for a new fiscal year. So that's process, sort of long-winded. All right, next slide please. All right, so budget overview. This is just a snapshot of our budget broken into different categories. This is the revenue side of the page. This usually grows at a pretty steady increment. As we all know, there is an override that is being applied in FY25, so we'll see a pretty significant jump in our property tax growth in FY25. Our other funds, you'll also notice there's a huge decrease there. If you don't concede that, I'm not sure, but we don't have the ability to spend ARPA money as a general revenue offset next year, so we've already tapped that to the $210 million. It's just a cap, so we cannot use ARPA for a revenue replacement anymore in the future. ARPA funding really is what allowed the town to sort of squeeze a couple, really about a full year, out of the last override a little further. All right, maybe next slide. So this gives you a sense of revenue categories, just a visual breakdown. The lion's share, so 75%, comes from property taxes. Local receipts make up about 5%. State aid in various forms makes up about 13%. And then the remainder, about 7% total, is broken up into some other smaller categories, including free cash, which in recent years we've had record free cash, so that does help to offset our next year's operating budget. We have a policy where we spend 50% of our previous year's certified free cash as a revenue source. Next slide, please. All right, expenditures. So this is sort of the working plan for our budget for next year. Some high-level notes. We are growing our municipal departments by, we'll talk more about this in detail, but about 3.22%. This remains sort of under our growth cap. The number looks like it's a little higher, but we have a $250,000 override dollar value that's added into this figure, and that is to help offset our looming solid waste and recycling issue. That contract expires at the end of fiscal 2025, and so that is something that is ongoing and will become a pretty big challenge in the future, in the near future. What else? So schools. The Arlington Public School Department grew at a pretty high clip this year on a lot of that in FY25. A lot of that comes in the form of override commitments. The override was really built around funding the schools at more appropriate levels, and so the growth there was, it totaled out at 8%. Again, that was held to 3.5% per the commitments for general ed, 6.5% for special ed growth, and then a $3.1 million increase over the top of that. What else? Warrant articles. Looks like we have a large percentage jump there, but it's really not a huge dollar figure. Those flex up and down annually based on what sorts of warrant articles are coming before the town. We're looking, we're exploring ways to further offset that. There may be some opportunity to offset some of that with ARPA funding for some of the warrant articles, but we are looking a little deeper into that. So all in, we're looking at about a 6% increase over FY24. Go to the next slide, please. Again, this is our expenditure breakdown, just a visual representation. You'll see that the orange and the gray slivers or slices of the pie, those make up our education in general, the gray being Minuteman, orange being the Arlington school department, public school department. So together they make up about 48% of our budget. Top right, the darker blue looking wedge of the pie, which is about 20%, those are sort of the town municipal operations. Yellow on the left side, that is your, so sort of we look at that as overhead. It's not tied to departmental, so this is healthcare, pensions, that sort of thing. The second largest blue wedge on the top left, that's capital and that is a fairly significant piece of the pie. And then the remainder, we have a 1% FinCom reserve fund, warrant articles at 1%, and then overlay reserve, which we reserve in anticipation of not fully collecting all property taxes and allowing for abatements of taxes. Now I'll turn it back to Jim for some highlights. Next slide. So I know, I believe your folks were distributed what I understand the finance team calls the budget explainer, but sort of the roadmap of what is new this year, but I would touch upon some of what we'll call the highlights. As Alex noted, total expenditure growth was at 6.3%, but if you control for some of the override commitments, which I wanted to illustrate here, just to further demonstrate that the spending commitments were met. So absent the override commitments, you'd see town growth of $1,332,000 for approximately 3.22%. Again, there's a 3.25% cap. We don't necessarily view that as the target. We view that as the cap of which you would go up to, but some capacity remains there. And then across school growth was at 4.56%. If you remove the FY25 override commitment of $3.1 million. And again, that is sort of a blended rate because that includes both general education, which is allowed to grow at 3.5% in conjunction with special ed, which now grows at a rate of 6.5%. So Alex alluded to, much like you are beginning to dissect the town budgets, we spend a significant amount of time dissecting the departmental budget requests. We get sheets with new requests. This year, department heads submitted 38 requests total for a value of $830,000 in new expenses. Obviously, as we work through our process meeting with department heads, we whittled that down to funding 20 new requests, many of which were at a level probably significantly below the requested figure. So the town expense increases totaled $270,000, 717. What made up the bulk of this increase was the MTP pay and classification plan, which was introducing a ninth step to that plan. And that is for sort of what I call middle management folks within the organization. They are non-union. They are in a collective bargaining unit, but they would generally follow the ATP group, which is a collectively bargaining group. Whatever agreement they had reached, unfortunately, we weren't able to fund that ninth step last year that would have been committed. So we're following through on that commitment within the FY25 budget to meet that earlier commitment. You know, a big jump in electricity. So noting utility costs here, we're adding $55,000 to the facilities department's budget. We'll note, you know, we do competitively procure in bulk our supply. That contract does expire each December that we're locked in for multiple years. So we just saw in December of 2023, so for our January meter reads, our supply rate has gone up 46%. You couple that with a 10% increase on the distribution and transmission side for winter rates on Eversource, it results across the board in a pretty big spike in electricity costs. Also a bump in the facilities department for maintenance contract increases. Again, those are things we procure in three-year intervals via a competitive process. And with each year of that agreement, oftentimes the chosen vendor has built in some sort of escalator. You know, the largest contract usually is the custodial contract for the overnight nighttime cleaning that takes place. We also have contracts for elevator service and maintenance, roof maintenance. We have an electrical contract, a plumbing contract, an HVAC contract, and all of those hourly rates go up each year. So it's sort of a contractual increase being funded there. There are also some additions in the information technology budget that are new this year. So one is a dedicated internet service provider, so a new data line, in fact, for this building to support the upcoming body-worn camera program for the Allentown Police Department. So the sheer amount and size of those video files that needs to be handled and processed on a daily basis, the best practice is to in fact have it its own internet line instead of adding on to the existing fiber in the building. We're also pursuing seemingly for the first time but in response to sort of a growing threat to our networks is deploying some actual investments in cybersecurity. As you may have read in my budget message, it seems that if you've read some news about Lowell and some other water utilities that in fact municipal entities are no longer sort of forgotten about. As it may be with respect to cybersecurity, we have been effectively phished a few times in recent memory. If you guys have town emails, you may have seen some things come through that are seemingly bogus. That does happen. It is a growing threat, so we're trying to introduce $5,000 a year to implement a penetration testing program so we can work with a third-party vendor to sort of probe our network and identify weaknesses but also use those funds as each year moves to identify and develop and revise disaster recovery plans, perform different exercises that we need to as well as, and I'll admit I am by no means a tech guru and I think we have some in the room, but what's described as an endpoint detection and response protocol, I know that by sort of the industry leader CrowdStrike, so we would be looking to engage with a vendor like that that sort of provides a software package that is adaptable and is being maintained to sort of respond to these growing and evolving threats that is happening quite rapidly that lives in your network at each endpoint so that the devices that are there with end users and you can find things that, what I'll call Easter eggs, that get buried when someone was in there and is often the case that what was left during a phishing attempt that sort of malware or ransomware will live there for some period of time long before it becomes active, so this is a software that's constantly crawling our network and our devices to look for those potential threats but also has a response mechanism for sort of isolating them in a way and then as well as upgrading or what we'll call a GIS platform modernization, so many of you may be familiar with the software package we've used for a number of years called PeopleGIS, that is becoming a bit of an outdated platform, it no longer has the support that it used to, in fact it was once a local company when we, you know, based in Ireland and then it has since been been sold and bought out, it serves a number of different departments for various different purposes, it no longer frankly meets our needs but it no longer seems to meet the public needs. as well. We make all those data layers publicly accessible on a website separate from the town, and people do a lot of modeling and spatial analysis and figure out how zoning changes might impact the town or different developments. So we're looking to switch over to what I know to be the industry standard, that is the Esri ArcGIS platform that is far more robust, has a number of different tools, allows for different analytics. And frankly, many of those things are built in. You get to benefit from how robust the Microsoft platform is, but also get the advantage of tools that other people have developed, and it becomes part of the pool. So that assists us with asset management, work orders, anything you can envision with a GIS platform. It's something I could envision using to help document overnight parking requests and overnight flight. Anything that you can envision spatially, this is something that will benefit the community at large, but also a number of town departments. In terms of personnel on the general fund side, the only proposed increase this year is for one part-time circulation librarian for roughly $18,000. And the desired intent there, and this is based on a lot of things that I have heard over my years working here, but a desire to restore library hours and service levels to where they were back in 2003 when we cut a number of staff leading up to that, and we started closing the library on Thursday mornings. So this one strategic investment would allow us to restore Thursday morning hours at the Robbins Library. We estimate that that'll serve about 200 people every Thursday that are looking to get those library services. And it's strategically placed on the circulation side of things. In the past four years in aggregate, we've seen at least a 25% increase in circulation at our library. So not only that, we also introduced a pretty robust library of things that involves anything from metal detectors to sewing machines and other complex items that frankly require a lot more handling, inspection, and training on the circulation side of things. So this would sort of provide the additional staffing, but also through the week the additional support we need in circulation. So a fairly small investment for actually a robust return on that investment in terms of increasing service delivery. And then a couple other highlights I think listed here are street light repairs and replacements. So folks may recall a little over 10 years ago, we converted all our street lights to LEDs as part of the green communities program. And up until this point when they failed, they had a 10-year warranty. We were able to call and get them replaced. So didn't carry with it much of a cost for the town. We are now outside of our warranty window. So you will have to pay for the repairs and place replacements moving forward. Unless and until, I know we've discussed this via the capital plan, about finding the right time to actually revamp all of the fixtures because even the LED technology has come along, especially with the dimming and lighting levels. But for now we are expecting in order to be able to keep up with those replacements that we need to do that are no longer covered under warranty to see increased costs there. And then finally, field maintenance. That is another one of those things that we bid out and competitively procure for three-year intervals. And again, those costs tend to increase with each year. So many of you may know, we have a parks division that does a lot of the mowing and striping, but this is with respect to our turf treatment and protocol, like fertilization, aeration, overseeding, slice seeding, grub treatments, any number of sort of treatments that we put on all of our acres of turf across the town. So if we can hit the next slide. So the next slide here, and I know this lived in the budget explainer, we don't have to go through each and every line, but these are in fact all of the increases, but all of, or at least some of the decreases as well. So we did reduce the town's posted budget by $20,000. We did reduce the IT budget by $7,000 and that's noticed in a telephone expense line. And that is in fact, because there were some hard lines, I believe related to the high school and some other buildings. So some copper that was no longer necessary, it was redundant and we were able to cancel that service. And not shown here is another approximately $3,000 software decrease. As we begin to phase away from Informix, our old software for ICS, the prior water meter platform, we're sort of working on that transition. We have less of a commitment necessary to that program. So we're able to reduce that line by, I think it was about $2,600. So in then, in addition to this, you know, the $270,000 in sort of new expenses, the remaining portion of sort of the town ask where the town budget increases was set aside for the salary reserve. And that is because fiscal year 24 was the year of expiration for each and every one of our collective bargaining agreements. So fiscal 25, 26, and 27 is a new contract cycle for all of our unions. So as was customary in the past, we set aside money in advance of future settlement of those collective bargaining agreements. And what I'd say there is we tried to be as aggressive as possible in trying to set aside as much money as possible. And though it's not yet public, we are, you know, sort of finalizing our benchmark salary survey against the town manager 12 communities. I'll just remind you, our COLA pattern for the last three years was probably one and a half to two over the last three years. So like averaging about 1.75. Yeah, 1.8%. And needless to say, I think we're finding as a result of that salary survey, given what has happened in other municipalities, but what has happened more generally with the high inflationary pressure over the past three years, that we have, in fact, lost ground in certain areas of the market and with respect to certain positions. So, you know, we're happy to have set aside as much as we reasonably could have in hopes of potentially providing a stronger COLA pattern moving forward if we can.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So with that, I would turn it over to Alex to speak to some of the select board override commitments.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 29</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we do that, let's ask some questions on what you've covered so far. That's okay. I'll start with two questions. Have police officers agreed to wear body cameras?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 19</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it's the body-worn camera policy itself that is yet to be agreed to and is set for arbitration.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 3</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's the difference?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 72</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there's agreement in principle to a body-worn camera program. It's already been bargained in terms of a percent of salary has been agreed to for the BUP. It's the policy itself that governs their deployment and how they'll be used, when they'll be used, and those things. There's some language in there that there's, you know, some issues to be resolved with and we're set to hopefully resolve those this spring.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 20</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And field maintenance, has there been any thought to increase user fees to offset the increased costs in field maintenance?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 75</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So without getting into dollars and cents, yes. What we're finding is that it wasn't just field maintenance that has gone up. In fact, our port-a-potty contract has gone up significantly as well, so the recreation department is reviewing exactly how much the user fees can go up. But in large part, if they were to go up, it would be dedicated to funding, you know, the port-a-potties at all of the fields as well.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex McGee - 108</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I jump in real quick? One thing that we've sort of done over the last couple of months is ask all of our department heads to review all of the fees that they charge at the department level for all kinds of different services that are offered. Many of them have not been updated in quite a long time and so we're just taking a holistic review town-wide at all of our fees and we will be making some recommendations soon on fee changes. And so we're in the middle of that process right now, but that is something that we're working on just as an FYI.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?1 - 32</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other questions? So I have two questions. The first one is your electricity costs, is it our use of electricity that's going up or is it the cost of the kilowatt hour?</blockquote>

It's the per kilowatt hour cost. So, you know, December we were maybe eight cents and now we're at 12 cents and that distribution has gone up as well. All right, so more than two and a half percent, one and three percent.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?1 - 64</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, and then contracted services, similarly, do we have any of the, you read off a bunch of them that go up every year, like field maintenance, biographics, launch helper, what on average is the increase that we get asked for, even if we're competitive, if it goes out, are we falling below three percent or are we getting two percent? I mean what?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex McGee and Jim Feeney - 6</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is oftentimes above two percent.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?1 - 22</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So a lot of times it's around five percent. So not within two and a half percent. Just checking. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?2 - 54</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a question about the ARPA drop in spending that you mentioned that went from about five million to about half a million. Annie and I are in charge of the health and human services budget, so I know we do still have ARPA offsets. Are those the 450,000 that is in there?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex McGee and Jim Feeney - 56</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Okay. So the drop was the $55 million in general fund revenue offset that was permitted by Treasury. So that's the steep cliff, but the staffing remains except for one ARPA position in HHS, which was no longer needed. That was a health compliance officer position, which is the one difference between 24 and 25.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?2 - 5</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex McGee and Jim Feeney - 59</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just so you know, that $450,000 is not tied to ARPA. That's right there. That is an overlay reserve surplus that we're budgeting to be used as a revenue source, which is sort of standard. It's an annual thing. This does not showcase all of our ARPA funding and where it's sort of like is found throughout the organization.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 6</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Charlie, then John, then Tulsa.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 859</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have two questions. One year, a couple of years ago, when body cameras were first raised as a possibility in the Arlington Police Department, there was considerable discussion at the Finance Committee and later at town meeting about the policies not to do with the use of the cameras by the police, but how the data that was produced would be protected. And the example that was given by one of our members was that there can be all sorts of private scenes recorded on these cameras that are not necessarily crime related or whatever, and that needs some privacy controls. Is there any policy about that that's been developed? Charlie, to be honest, I don't have a good answer to that question for you this evening. Can we take a look at that? I mean, I don't need a response tomorrow, but I think it's an important question. Yeah, I think so. It is often the case with much of what's handled here at the police department is there's a desire to segregate that information and have it be managed by a very particular third party vendor that we do for much of what's collected here to limit sort of access to the outside world and not just the outside world, but even within the organization and having it sort of live on a separate network. So that is fairly customary for what gets handled here, and I imagine the same is true, but I'd want to be able to speak more intelligently to exactly what the plan is to make sure that that's secure. Thank you. The second question is that you mentioned that we were finally getting rid of the Informix software, which is great. It's only taken about 20 years. Not getting rid of it entirely, but almost. Okay, working towards it. Yeah, so we had a big investment in new meter readers, remote meter readers, and it seemed like my recollection from prior years' discussion was that it could not be implemented because of this Informix system. Have we gotten over that hump, or is that still a problem? But I think the hump that we're still getting over is finishing the deployment of all of the new meters and readers. So we're still in the midst of that program. I think we still have maybe 600 or 700 meters that we're still trying to get into households for, and we experienced a pretty significant delay in that project with some supply chain issues. We're not able to get as much of the products as we needed to, but that is underway. We're sort of sending second notices, final notices, but until we've completely deployed the new product, we can't fully turn off the old product. So it's the availability of the meter readers that's keeping Informix as opposed to Informix preventing the meter readers from coming in? Yeah, that's my understanding. We have to get all of the new meters and meter readers installed before we can... This is a program that we started at least five years ago, if not longer, as I recall. I mean, I was on the Capital Planning Committee when we acquired, or at least allegedly funded, the new meters. So I'm noticing some bit of discrepancy here, because a good portion of this project we are funding with ARPA dollars, which didn't come until after five years ago. So I'd have to look at exactly what may have been contemplated five years ago. Well, we had something. I know we had a multi-hundred thousand dollar project to fund and budgeted some time ago. Sure. In any event, it would be nice if we got there. At the time, we were looking at the possibilities of labor savings as a result of this. What's the contemplated outcome now on that? Budget, labor savings with respect to... Well, we used to have people going around, you know, going down to the basements and reading meters, you know. And then we had meters outside, so they come and... Now, I understand the new program is remote reader reading. Truck drives around, picks up the signal, records it. So that means a lot fewer people climbing up steps or going behind buildings, etc. What's going to happen with that personnel layer? So we've been doing remote reads like this now for a number of years, so that that wouldn't be a new and upcoming change. The way it is now that the meters go to a transmitter that lives on the side of your house, and then that transmitter signal to what's known as a collector device, which we have a handful of around town at sort of high points. So it's actually been, you know, some time now that we've been able to read most meters from afar. So I don't see there being a significant shift once this phase of deployment completes. What's keeping informants? The fact that we still have some old technology out there. It's a much smaller extent, but we're essentially still running two systems. Got it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John? Yeah, sure. My question relates to the Override Stabilization Fund. It looks like it's pretty high at the end of FY24. It's up to $17.6 million, which is, you know, I saw like maybe $10 million higher than we saw at least on the version I'm looking at last year. So that came in a lot higher than expected at the end of FY24. Which version are you looking at? So I'm looking at a version from last year. I think it's the final one. I apologize if it isn't, but it looks like here it says we're going to finish up the Override Stabilization Fund with $7.9 million, and it seems like that turned into $17.6 million, which sounds like great news. Is that true? Am I generally accurate here?</blockquote>

It seems like it's higher than expected. And is that, you know, somewhat of a windfall? Does that affect the long range plan in a good way?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex McGee and Jim Feeney - 158</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, it affected it in a good way in such that we didn't need an override in fiscal year 24. Okay. What I think we're seeing as a relic for that FY24 budget is that the Override Stabilization Fund figure in that long range plan was likely a sort of like static figure that had not been uh, getting shown the benefit of interest over time. But I'll tell you right now that that particular account pulls in, you know, upwards of $120,000 a month in interest, given where rates are right now and where the principal balance is. So that is a figure as of today, and that is without even having reconciled some of those, you know, we're usually four to six weeks behind reconciling all the various bank accounts. So that's what lives in what we call Munis, our financial system today, but it continues to grow because we're not yet drawing down from it.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Griffin - 125</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And if you go to the top, you know, the override stabilization fund that was utilized in FY24 seems like a pretty low amount, $795K. So it just seems like, you know, it's good news. And I'm curious, you know, when you get to FY25, still, you know, basically the budget we're looking at next year, you know, you're almost down to zero on the stabilization fund. Is, you know, I guess my question is, why is, you know, why is the stabilization fund down? With all that good news, and I know I'm generalizing, you know, that good news, why is the stabilization fund still not $209K next year, the budget we'll be looking at next year, the FY25? The FY26 budget, yeah.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex McGee and Jim Feeney - 414</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, there's like a number of ways to sort of explain this because there's so many different movies in here. And so the first thing, so our free cash usage is one thing we need to key in here. We use a 10-year trailing average to calculate our usage of free cash in our out years. So we use that to forecast going forward. But in the last couple of years, we've had record high levels of free cash. So what we're projecting in our plan, our usage we know is going to be, so in FY26, we're showing $5.704 million in free cash. We are very likely to have a higher number than that in that category. So anything that we can contribute in that free cash line will drive our usage of overrides stabilization down. Additionally, we are carrying, if you just look at FY25 in our local receipts line, we're carrying $10.25 million there. We estimate our revenues very conservatively with our local receipts in anticipation of not screwing ourselves over. We don't want to end up upside down on our receipt collection. In last year, we came in at about $15 million in our local receipts. So you get an idea, like the benchmark again. All of that excess money closes to free cash. So there's a number of things that contribute to this. Additionally, things that build into our free cash number, departmental turnbacks, so any money that is appropriated but remains unspent, that goes back into our free cash number and then is appropriated into a future year. So with that being said, we're looking at a large red number in FY27. This plan, it compounds your issues over time. And so any sort of an issue is magnified each year, it goes out. So that $17 million, if you're looking in your budget book, deficit in FY27 is likely to be smaller than that based on the benefit of higher free cash numbers and turnbacks, et cetera. Also, we're likely to have marginally better new growth and other sort of like revenue numbers, which is very conservative. So the point being that our override stabilization fund, we will likely not drop down as quickly as we're showing on this plan, but we do have to plan for it just in case. So let's have the questions focused on departmental budgets, and then we'll talk about the long range plan. We have a couple of slides on that.</blockquote>

You had said there was a $3,000 reduction. Approximately $2,600, the IT department reported. Okay, because the IT budget here shows it budgeted at 7K in FY24 and FY25. Right. So it's one of those things that's not yet shown, but that they recently reported to us as having right sized that number. Okay. And the other thing I noticed in the pie chart is capital budget was 11%. And I had always been under the impression that we set aside 5%. So can you explain?</blockquote>

So we, we keep our 5% number. That is a number that we like really won't move up or down work very well here. And. Yeah, so we're at 5%. The. Yeah. So. There is a very intricate series of expenditures that we consider. And then there are also like a huge number of offsets that we consider, which allows us to zero in on a 5% number. And we can look at that capital budget more closely, or I can send it to you, but. It's actually. Right. Okay. No, I mean, the general gist. Right. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Just a comment on that.</blockquote>

This isn't necessarily something I have. Discussed with the recreation director. I don't know if that's something that's been discussed with the recreation director.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. The override. So as part of the recent override, the select board. Approving of the ballot question. This budget maintains all of those commitments. Which financially they're three and a quarter percent. A growth cap. On the town. Three and a half percent. So. Maintains the commitments to respond to enrollment pressures. Both positive and negative. So. The school's budget flexes up or down with the addition or subtraction of students at the rate of 50%. Jesse's per pupil funding number. So we've made additional contributions. Our school department. Some smaller investments in the town. $600,000. This is for our, we've made additional contributions to our open liabilities. Additional contributions to our mobility. So sidewalks. Roadways through capital. So we've made additional contributions to our open liabilities. So that's going to be a big problem. Our solid waste and recycle. We talked about this next year there. Oh, you know, some. This is separate from the budget, but so sort of as a promise was to try to look after our seniors a little more. So. Moving the senior circuit tax breaker. So we've made additional contributions to our open liabilities. So we've made additional contributions to our open liabilities. Our seniors in town. And a. The bottom one is maintaining a 5% financial reserve. That's a no brainer. This is our, my personal top priorities. Keep our triple a bond rating here. It is very important. How we are doing, how we're able to borrow money out. So we've alluded to a revenue shortfall. This came from the governor's budget. Being funded funding chapter 70. State aid at a lower number than we had projected. The what is called the student opportunity act increased funding for certain communities over a duration of time. Over the last two years. So. We saw pretty significant increases in our chapter 78. We had projected that. That that increase would remain high. We thought that a 5%. Revenue was. Relatively conservative that came in and just under 1%. Creating the $650,000 shortfall that we talked about earlier. And then we saw a little bit of an increase in our, in our revenue. That we're going to grow off of in future years. It creates about a little over a million dollars. Deficit. FY. 26. You go to the next slide. I doubt anyone will be able to see that unless you have a telescope, but you should be able to tell that. There's a red number at the bottom. There's a red number at the bottom. Which used to be balanced to zero. Right. So this is the whole that we're working to find out. And so. I don't know. I'm talking about these are you Jim. You can feel free to run through them is, you know, As Alex is alluding to. I didn't want to call out one thing that I realized we didn't mention, but we did get one bit of good news this year. That was, you may have noticed that the minute man. School budget. Which decreased. I want to call out that. There was one bit of good news. I don't want it to be. I don't want to call it out. I don't want to call it out. And frankly, it's sort of an. Building off of that, that is due to their chapter 78 going up. It was also higher than they expected in fiscal year 24. And that left them with a bit of a surplus for member communities. The member of community subsequently voted to take that surplus. And. So that's a bit of a surplus. And that is due to the minute man coming here. That will not necessarily be bonded. And of course we excluded that debt here in Arlington. So we will not have to put anything else for the minute man school building project. On the tax rate. Recap. We won't have to raise it because it's going to be getting funded with that. The surplus chapter 78 from school year 24. So I just want to point out that there was that one shred of good news for. The community. So this is, we're looking to. To help time out of our revenue challenge here with chapter 70. So local receipts are ambulance revenue. You guys will likely recall last year, there was a change in how our ambulance revenue was collected. We have advanced life support, basic life support. And we're looking to expand that. Into our ambulance revolving fund. The benefit to that is that in FYI 23, we collected almost a million dollars. 24 we're tracking to man comfortably over a million dollars. That's like through, I think the November. Number that 522,000 that we've collected already. In our year to date, like in our FYI 25 budget, we're carrying just $500,000. In our year to date, we've collected about $3.1 million in our year to date. So that's something we're considering our overlay reserve surplus. This is money that has been budgeted into the overlay for over the accumulation of years. Anything that is not. Granted in abatements. Or it doesn't go uncollected then gets close to a, it doesn't close to the general fund. It remains in the overlay as surplus. And so that's something that we're looking at. We're looking at. We're looking at how much money the assessors have to do an analysis and verify what they believe their. Maximum liabilities are. And then they would then take a vote. To allow the select board to consider that with their budget. So there's an official process there. We are likely to be able to. So, as you can see in the long range plan, you have it. What had been shown was a decreasing or conservative. Overlay reserve surplus usage on the revenue side of the ledger. So for. Fiscal year 25, we had projected a. $450,000. Usage noting and, you know, Fiscal year 24 that at 600,000. Historically it's been. It's been shown currently in December 25. That's it. 450,000. But again, That's something that the. Board of assessors is working on as Alex alluded to. Great. And then new growth. We do know that we have some new projects coming online in FYI. 25. We do know that we have some new projects coming online in FYI. 25. We do know that we have some new projects coming online in FYI. 25. The last two years, we've been a little over 1.2 million and 23 and then almost 1.3 million. And if we're 24, we're likely to crest over a million dollars in FYI 25, just with what we know is in the pipeline right now. So we may be able to adjust upward a little bit there as well. Okay. So there are a number of warrant articles that we are considering. How we can creatively fund them. Within sticking into an ARPA category to fund them. So specifically we're looking at work on the master plan. The 250th celebration and also some capital projects. That we may be able to fund via ARPA. So we're looking at that as well. We've. You know, been consulting peers on what they've been doing. How they have. You know, look at funding things with ARPA. And so we're trying to get creative on. How we can reduce the sort of cash expense to us and, you know, some grants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. More questions. It's. Okay. Okay. So we think. Increase. Some of the local receipts on the revenue side. We're going to go back up a little bit. And we think we're safe on the new growth. Despite the. The current. What's already been 50% captured. So we are already guaranteed. The other 50% things like the my rack project. And so I guess the question I have. What's the trend line on those two categories. Keep it up. Going forward, because obviously we don't have this money this year. And we don't have. We're not expecting more. More. On our trend. Yeah, certainly with ambulance revenues. Yes. This is just a function of our new model. Right. You know, we're. As Alex said, the year to date figure is actually quite a bit of a lag because we don't handle the billing directly. So much of it's getting processed through Armstrong. We don't know. I guess we're not expecting less. Ambulance rides. We're probably expecting. You know, if you speak to just the those items that are sort of more economic. You know, even with permit revenue that we're seeing different types of projects. Permit revenue is still sort of blowing estimates out of the water again. So we haven't seen, I don't think. Exactly the slowdown that we thought we might see. So, what kind of different projects are we seeing? I think. We're not seeing, you know, we haven't seen quite as many single family home. Demolitions, but I would say we're still seeing a number of projects. So this is interest rates impacting it. I think that impacts more so certain builders. Who are going to be facing the short term impact of those higher interest rates. But homeowners doing large projects, which we call, we categorize those as 200,000 dollars or greater. Seeing the same number of those projects, even. Those projects growing and cost 800,000 dollar renovations, 600,000 dollar renovations. Obviously, those folks are impacted by those interest rates too, but if it's. You're building your forever home, and you see what's on the horizon, you're likely just to refinance it. You know, after a few years, so I think it's deterred only a certain category of our builders. Who actually finance projects, we're still. Right, and we're still seeing a number that pay cash and they are still. You know, still doing tear downs. We're still seeing some lot splits. You know, single families turning into 2 families and we get new growth out of those larger renovations. At some point, you know.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That that is captured in our budget. That the 8% number, which is over and above is captured within our budget. In the 5 year plan. Correct. Okay. Thank you. Yes. You know that because it's grouped with. Pensions and because the insurance budget also has workman's comp and a number of other things. When you look at that line, it's total growth shows is less than 8% because it's blended with those other categories, but it's just the. Health insurance premiums that are projected to go up by 8 to 10%. And when we found that out, there was sort of like, it was about a 1Million dollar hit to our insurance budget. Now, that was 1 of the times we sat down with the school department and 1 of the areas we identified to provide. Some relief was having the. After school programming staff and their insurance costs be born. Within the school department's budget, so, but that 1Million dollar. Change is in the current, but we knew about that before publishing. Okay. We, we won't know, right? The final number until early March, and then we will react accordingly. You know, they'll announce the early March will announce the rates for the various plans and then we have to go through and pair up.

Whatever the peak rate that they use per day. And determine their whole rate, and so that by installing batteries. They kind of diminish that load. I don't know if our.

Yeah, I know that was something we had contemplated for a portion of the islands and high school building project, but for whatever reason, it didn't pan out. They're doing all their buildings like this the same model. Yeah, right now, the only thing we've recently started participating in is we do what's called a load shedding. So we belong to a group that you get. That sort of an urgent notice from the, the is 1, sort of the grid saying we expect this to be a peak demand day. And if we proactively engage load shedding, and it's oftentimes during the summer and our biggest energy users in the school building. So, you might pre cool them the evening before and then we have to. Agree to set the air conditioning at a much higher temperature and our participation in that program. Is netted us at certain buildings, you know, it's usually around like, 10,000 dollars a year for participation. At each site, because we do our part to, I guess, reduce stress on the grid at those.

So, just to avoid a future, at least prolong a future override. Is there any discussions about. You know, taking some of it, you know, taking some of these hits to that 7Million dollars.

You know, we haven't modeled this yet to know exactly how far we've gotten. Yeah, and it would now we may need to revisit both on either the town or the school side. So I think that. Those discussions with forthcoming, I'd be naive to sit here and say that we have a. That we've ironed out a plan to sort of ourselves out, but we didn't. Sort of think about it on that macro level. Quite yet, because, you know, we sort of also. Sent everyone's budget numbers to them and then got the news after the fact, you know, that it happened another way. I think that that probably would have been. But if the inappropriate logic model to apply, but, yeah, I just. I, I don't like the fact that the 7M dollars is already spent. You know, I feel like there should be a little bit of flexibility with that 7M dollars, but I actually watched the select committee meeting when they did approve the override and they did. Consider the, you know, these new programs and of course, they did say they like the new programs. But only the, you know, the 7M operating override is what made it to the ballot. And that's probably, I think, what most of the voters did is an operating override. So, in other words, a lot more flexibility with how it's spent. And maybe 1 other thing I did hear in the discussion on the select committee was that, you know, they don't want overrides in 2 or 3 years. So, I know that's a macro huge discussion, but the impression I got was that they do not want overrides every 3, 4 years. So, okay, how do you avoid that? I would think you take another look at that 7M dollars. Sure. Yeah, and I know I wouldn't want to speak for them or pretend to know exactly how they feel about the timing of frequency of the override. John?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, with respect to John's comments, number 1, I think the DOR only allows you to put a number on the ballot. You can't put any details on it. So, that sort of constrains the select board putting up a number. I thought you could actually say you would want a new firetruck. That's a debt exclusion. That's a different thing than an override. Secondly, my understanding is that the DOR has previously ruled that if a select board or a municipal council or whatever says that they're going to do certain things with this override money, the community is bound to follow that commitment for the first year. Right. And then after that, it can be adjustments. But the first year that that commitment is made to the voters, it has to be followed. Correct. I want to know because I don't think the select can appropriate money. No, no, no. What the DOR said is if the municipal management makes commitments for X, Y, and Z for an override, those commitments have to be met in the first year. Second year beyond is for grabs.</blockquote>

I think that might be the situation where there's more detail on the ballot. In other words, when the ballot says, we're going to take the $7 million and buy a firetruck, which is what outside of that is not an override. It's not an override. What is that? It's capitalized. It's a different matter. All right. Thank you. Yeah, just a couple of questions. I noticed in my eye, this court judgment, Sims, is that vestigial at this point?

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, and then the municipal budget, the municipal building insurance trust fund, as I understand it, that's, you know, insurance on the buildings, the buildings are down. You have a deductible. Okay. This is what that's what. Okay, that's invested in growing. Right. And at times, it would provide relief if you need to take immediate action before you would get bills to pay before you basically for the insurance company. Yeah. Other questions. You mentioned the changes to the ambulance fees. Does the ambulance revolving funds still have a purpose or is it going away? It does have a purpose. It is not as great as it once was because we do still collect some ALS revenue and we still book it into the revolving fund. So that still does get some treatment on the capital plan as an offset, although it's just not as much as it once was. So we could look at collecting all of our ambulance revenue into the general fund. It's not a very significant amount that's in the revolving fund, something that we eat a gym myself. We've been kind of thinking about what to do with it because it has changed significantly. I love to simplify stuff. Right. Yeah. But you've noticed like the offset has gone down over the last two years at the end of this year. It's okay. What's the balance left? Is it time to just move on from it?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney and ?5 - 313</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was just curious. I didn't know if you're applying that perhaps the offsets were high or low, or if simply that we thought they may need it to be sort of ground truth. It's a verification of something that, you know, or maybe not. I mean, we don't think they need to be done, but it's like, you know, things change. I understand. And other town managers have thought, not that you have to apply it by them, but they thought it should be done. Yeah. I mean, I think first, what I would commit to is, you know, personally understanding them a little bit better myself, but also, you know, as I understand it, I think all the departments that it applies to are still perfectly relevant. The way the program was established is still valid that there may be perhaps tweaks, as you know, like things may change over time in terms of like an IT level of effort versus the treasurer's level of effort. You know, ultimately, I would think it's probably a zero sum game, but that there may be, you know, shifts from sort of one department to another slightly in terms of the level of effort. I don't see why it would be a shift. There's a rate that says it's the amount of hours that they spend working on water and sewer activities. I don't know why they'd shift. They might go down, the amount of time might go down, and they might go up. Legal time, legal spend might go up, but again, it's up to you. I don't want to take up a lot of time. I just want to put forth and ask you if you want to do a commitment. Other town managers have thought that might be done, but never followed through. There may be a transparency issue here.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 221</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah, like I looked into this a little bit. We spoke a little bit earlier, and the DLS provides a suite of financial policies that communities can utilize, and when I was the finance director in the town of Hamilton, we did a community compact project around these financial policies, and one of them is indirect cost allocations, which is sort of the same thing as offsets, and so I took a look at that this afternoon a little more closely, and the DLS provides for four sort of different ways to calculate your water and sewer offsets, and the way that we do it here is one of those four ways. We should always be looking at everything, and looking at the level of effort is important, and I think it's worth looking at every year, so I'm happy to keep looking at that. I think related to that, many generations ago, DLS wrote a report with a number of recommendations on it, and I believe one of them was to basically take water and sewer offsets out of the individual budgets, aggregate them for the town, and have one big offset, but not allocate them across departments, and therefore you'd have an actual department cost without applying offsets to it. I'll see if I can find that report.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney and ?5 - 493</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that's better, though, in terms of for us to figure out? Well, it's certainly simpler. It is simpler, but if we wanted to know how much legal the department is really doing for water and sewer, that's... We still have that number, but it's just a matter of how you structure the budgets, whether the money comes in as a lump sum, that sum that's derived from time sheets, or whether it comes in each department. I'll dig up the report and find out. That was the DLS recommendation, if I recall correctly. So it doesn't become a budget issue, it becomes a time sheet issue. Well, right, that might just be another. So it's not one of the methods, but my point was more that. Well, the, for instance, the legal department spends. What, like, 20%, maybe 1 out of every 5 hours working on water and sewer. 12 years ago, that was determined or. However, long ago that was determined. Maybe they spend more time on it. Right. Understood. Yeah, I think don't we want to know. Or maybe they spend less and it doesn't net out. That's what I don't. I don't understand. It doesn't net out. If lawyers do less work, it doesn't mean that postage does more. So I don't understand that so much. It doesn't see how it nets out. I think I was thinking about a different circumstances. We talked earlier about. We had run an older, outdated software that perhaps required a significant amount of it support. To run, but then you then you switch software and it requires less it support, but then it's being managed entirely by someone in the treasurer's office, right? Like, the level of effort. Sort of was just shifting in a way, but I understand what you're saying that. Someone could be doing, in fact, more or less some 10 years later. And it doesn't net up to 100. It's a percentage of the budgets of those particular. So I think it's sort of a transparent thing because, you know, that. Because up every year, and so does the. So, as the budget, so if they're working less, it's, it just doesn't it may not be as equitable as if a new study was done. Right? And I think from the transparency perspective, right? If you look at some of the offsets in the budget, if you looked at. CDBG, other things, right? It is tied specifically to an individual and you can see. Exactly what percentage of that individual salary it's funding. So you. Reach the conclusion that you have that much that person's time, but for water and sewer, as it is currently, right? Like, it, it lives at the departmental level. And isn't necessarily tied to particular individuals within that department. So I can see how it doesn't provide the level of clarity that may be. Observable with other offsets in the budget.</blockquote>

The operational future of the town, are you thinking in terms of, you know, we, we, as a finance committee, tend to be a little paranoid about adding positions. But sometimes it's not about adding, it's about, you get some turnover. Can we switch out when we. At a position here and take this 1 away, because it's now not. Modern anymore, so on and so forth. Do you look over the whole budget to look for those opportunities? Are you looking for places where, you know, we need to. And service, because it's 2024. And are there things that are in other job descriptions where those job descriptions don't need to. Either functions, am I making any sense?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 439</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think so. And I think what I would say is. That happens with really every vacancy, you know, I spend time. Reviewing job descriptions really every week and then. Sort of making modern, you know, modern edits to them so that before we post them, it reflects what we're actually looking for. So I think we take that opportunity. Every time we have a vacancy, whether it's a union position or not to really look. Part of what it's going to take and I think there are probably some examples I could use, but I can see. In the future as well, you know, oftentimes seeking the opportunity to. Perhaps combined positions, or. You know, I, I personally am not 1. I'm not going to sit here and say, like, perhaps because I've worked here for a really long time. I know that we are not in a position where I can have sort of grand plans and come and say, you know, I need to add. Sort of, you know, 5 general fund positions or this or that, like, so I wouldn't say I'm thinking about it. That way, but I think we try to look for every opportunity, like, okay, you know, how is this structure working? You know, how is that work chart flowing with, you know, where are we struggling to hire? Where are we not struggling to hire? Okay. What are we doing? Well, there, and what are we not doing? Well, they are required. Yeah. Why do we have more vacancies at this level and another level? So I think those are what can we stop doing in order to be able to start doing something. Yeah, you can see a lot of that happening in the class each year. Yes. So we see some of that directly and in my conversations with Karen, it's clear that she's looking at. That when the time comes, sometimes when she's just looking at each department and HR within the department, and sometimes when people come to her and say. This isn't the job I'm doing, can we change my title to something that reflects my job? It comes from the employee, but she's also doing that as well. And sometimes it's as simple as a title change to modernize what the position is. So when it's posted, someone's like, oh, I know what that means. I know what's a typist. Yeah, exactly. I just like saying, wiping them all out. I couldn't be working on this discussion. Like, all these different ways of saying, like, the project manager, let's call it a project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, unfortunately, the town manager. That we have the old position. So if we start with the library budget, which is by that one 34. We're going to start with the library budget. You look all the way at the bottom that's currently vacant. There's a new position of library assistant for 17 and a half hours per week. And as the town manager referenced, this is going to help them open on Thursday mornings. When Annie and I met with. The library director, Anna Litton. She was very excited about that. She said. She said that was their. Their largest priority. Other things you might notice in the salary details. So of course we'd always like, if a new person joins the position, we'd love to pay them less. So if you look at branch library and about three quarters of the way down, that's an example where the new. Person that actually does perceive less. And the old, however, this is balanced out. In some other positions, unfortunately, you see the opposite. So for example, for that new head of circulation. And I asked Anna why the new head of circulation is like so much more money. And she said that in order to fill that position, they're finding in the library that sometimes in order to fill positions, they are having to offer higher salaries. So for example, that person came. From Framingham state university was already receiving a higher salary. So. There's both things happening in this budget. People getting a little bit more or a little bit less. So. So that's not reflected, of course, in this budget, but since they've added Thursday mornings back. The next thing they really feel that they're short on is staffing for children and youth services. So they're not meeting the. Expectations of. Library advisory organizations. So in the future, that may be something that they would like to ask the town manager to do. So. This is a position where they believe they have the demand to need additional. Services and children's library. Capacity. This is a position that we've heard about. Three years in a row. They've been told they can't add this. So. This is not necessarily a one-for-one. But sometimes that's. End of editorial. Thank you. So back to the main page on library salaries. Topher, you had had a question about what the. Stipends were. Those are just part of the union contract. So. It works exactly the same way. It's just certain employees receive that as part of their. Project. All of the other elements. We are not saying any change with the exception of. The books and materials. So this reflects this. $7,500 increase reflects. Additional spending for digital services. So. If you look in the budget. You see money that we give to the minute man library consortium. So that shows up under other contracting services, five, two, three, six. That is a subscription service for the. Belong to the minimum consortium. But then also within books and materials, that's where we pay for the digital. And that's where we pay for the books and materials. And they're asking for an additional $7,500. Digital materials. She did say Arlington is the largest consumer within the minute. Group. So. The total amount we do spend between. The other contracted services and the books and materials. The total thing that we make. So. So. One of the things Annie and I talked about was. 33,500 for maintenance. By two or two minutes. They're actually we're higher. So we were a little bit. She's not worried about that. She said some of that work is being done through the facilities. So she thinks that. So. Another thing to know at the bottom is the Fox offsets. Are listed at $30,000. A little resale shop. So the Fox. But not appearing on this, but if you'd like more detail, you could see in the SharePoint or the library section. There is a nice pie chart that tells you the additional money that you're going to be spending. So. The. The Arlington library foundations. State aid Fox shop. Essentially. The budget you see here of about 2.8 million. Is 500,000 less than their actual spending. So they get about 500,000. From outside sources. Which again, if you want the actual breakdown, it's available on the SharePoint. So. Half of it comes from the town. There's about $9 million in there. Funds. But they're not all. Yeah, that does not mean they are available. What else can I tell you? The last thing she mentioned was. Again, going forward, not reflected on this budget, but something to think about. Is that. The clever is hoping to rebuild the Fox branch. And. In order to. Raise money for that. fundraiser that will be paid for by a donation. So they'll use some of the donations to hire the person who will then lead a fundraising capital campaign. They'll take the money from the capital campaign, it's money from the state to hopefully build a box in the future, something to keep our eye out for.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Annie LaCourt - 285</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other things on libraries? I think those were the highlights. I mean, one of the things that I really appreciate about this budget is that, you know, they are doing their best to leverage private, outside funds, donations, so on and so forth. And, you know, it is true that those funds can only be used for non-selling expenses. So those funds make a huge difference to the amount of books and materials the library has to circulate and very much support what's available to the public. And then I think, you know, Rebecca and I were equally excited about the restoration of those hours in 2004 when we had one of the worst budget cuts we ever had from the state. We reduced library hours by a lot more than that and have slowly kind of worked them back. And so it's been really great. And then just to remember that we have an obligation to spend a certain amount of our musical budget on the libraries in order to maintain our membership in the Minuteman Network. It's like a state law or requirement or whatever. And so we can't fall below that. We fall below opening the waiver to continue to maintain our relationships with other libraries. And being able to lend back and forth through the Minuteman Network is a big part of what makes our library attractive to many people in the town, for example, our students and local universities. So it's kind of an overview of how that kind of fits into our town as a cultural asset. Oh, the promotion. I do. I would like to move approval of the library budget in the amount of $2,822,379. Second.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, we're in good shape right now. I'm probably starved for life by the early 2000s when for several years we were below it and we had to get away with labor because of severe cuffing and call over town. It wasn't just libraries, it was everywhere. I was a big, big drop in state aid, which was based on the, there was a recession in 2002. What was the recession? It's mostly our materials. We have, the town has to fund our books and materials line to a certain extent and the overall library budget to a certain extent. It's part of why we haven't moved all of facilities maintenance to front line or in two facilities because we have this, I don't know what the exact threshold is. I know we're safe at the moment. Okay. It's just a thing to keep in mind. Should we fall upon very hard times when we're looking at this budget, there's a big risk to making good cuts here. And that's the big risk.

Friends of the Robbins library is sort of like the Fox things. Is there, I know they seem, I think they raise a fair amount of money with the bookstore and things like that. Why isn't that listed as an offset?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Annie LaCourt and Allan Tosti - 428</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it's, it's off budget. That's right. So it's, it's part of this 500,000 that just doesn't appear in the budget at all. So I will hand you the piece of paper. Okay. Why is the Fox library offset in there then? What's the difference? Well, that's not friends. That's just store, right? Yeah. I don't know why that was. I don't know. Okay. So, but so, so do you, do you know how much the friends, yes, the friends get $42,739. Great. So those books persist. Second question, the manager mentioned the library of things, which I think is a great idea, but do you see what the future is? And is that a good or a bad thing for the operations of the library? Is it a real distraction for staff or, you know, we didn't discuss it this year. The first year that I did talk about the library, it is actually kind of really important to, I mean, it's, it's very popular. What's the circulation? I don't know, but I know that it's very popular. I mean, I have to go back and look at all the times, two years ago, I remember it's very popular. And I think that part of the reason that they need to grow and maintain it is because there is demand. So one of the things that's a consistent theme in talking to the library director is that she's concentrating on where the demand is to expand services or materials or whatever. She's paying very much attention to what is and is not sacred. And they shift their investments based on that, hence more money going into digital than say, seeds, which we don't, you know, purchase anymore at all. So it's, in the sense that it's responding to direct demand from the citizens and its users, it's sort of what this perfect government entity, right? It's so direct. There's no question about whether the citizens really want that service or not, but they do. That theory is a great thing, but it takes up a lot of room and probably a lot of staff time. It's reassuring that it's no, I don't think just over the three years of doing this project, I don't think they would continue to do something that they didn't think was both successful and efficient. That make sense? Because that's sort of the theme that runs through our conversations. They're concentrating on where's the demand and how to remove it, not on doing something for the sake of doing it. Thank you.</blockquote>

Yeah, I don't think they believe they could do the whole thing with a capital campaign, but I think that they do believe that it's not going to happen without some kind of capital campaign. Well, where's the rest of the money coming from? Well, I mean, I don't know what's in the capital plan, but I would assume that they will either be applying to the capital plan, waiting until we get on it, or that they will be looking for state funding. There's state funding similar to how there's state funding for schools. It doesn't build the school, but it does. They'll probably have to do all of the above. Yeah. That was my understanding, but I don't know the balance. And it's typical for public libraries that they do a capital campaign when they're going to do an expansion. We don't like that. It's not weird. No, no, it was more just how much it was. Charlie, did you have any handouts? I'm sure, but I think Annie answered my question. I was concerned about our prior risk of losing accreditation, but I think that's what she was talking about, so I'm done. Yeah, that's exactly it.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rebecca Younkin - 653</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So, Annie and I met with Joe Hawley. We talked about the threat and the right. If you, let's see, the highlights here. So, when we talked to Joe about how he does the budget for both the RAC and his budgeting strategy, you see a lot more sort of changes, both increases and decreases on the right side relative to some of the other budgets in town. Basically, the way he likes to do the budget, he says he's very conservative about maintaining his funds, his retained earnings funds, but then when he's looking at each line item, basically he looks at what he's actually spending and he adjusts his budget to what he feels he's actually spending. He thinks more about what he's actually spending than what, you know, make it match last year so that it looks like a zero percent change, right? So, overall, some of the changes that you see would be, for example, the equipment buildings round item 5203. There's an increase of $20,000 and we asked him about that and he said basically that is the $70,000 is more, matches more closely what they're actually spending because he had been using some of the RAC resources to pay that in the past, but the $70,000 is just a little bit more accurate. We were super impressed by his decrease in natural gas usage and, again, he just said that $32,000, the decrease to $32,000 from $45,000 in the budget was just that their their actual natural gas bills are low, so fantastic. The end result of this is they're expecting a budget of spending $688,987 and are matching that with revenues of the same amount, $688,787. One of the significant, okay, so when you look at page 183, the last two columns on the right are completely arbitrary. Ignore those two columns entirely. Those are somehow got cut and pasted from some previous budget, so the 2024 budget number is correct, the 2025 budget number is correct, but when it tells you dollars change and percent change, those numbers are made up. Ignore those. We've asked the town manager for a corrected version. Hopefully that'll come eventually, but you can just eyeball them and see where there's a change. When there's an increase in his expected revenue for admissions fees, public skating, we asked him about that and say he's both charging more per ticket for public skate, but also that they found that there's a huge demand for public skating sessions, especially during school vacations, so he said when it's school vacation week, they just open up the rink and they have been making a lot more money. The item we asked about non-ice rentals, if you run an ice skating rink, what are you renting that's not ice, and it turns out it's things like school dances, when the space is not actually functioning as a rink, you can hold a dance in there. Let's see. Oh yeah, there was a question about retained earnings, so the retained earnings balance currently for the rink is $82,042, so his strategy on retained earnings is he spends some each year and looks to put in a little bit more, so his retained earnings, he's very conservative about it, he says, and yeah, it goes for the rink, it has been going up a tiny bit each year. He doesn't pull that money out if he doesn't need it, so he kind of hopes to balance out with better revenue than he budgeted, but he's budgeting $50,000. Okay, so I forget how I make a motion. Okay, so I want an approval of the Ed Burns Arena Enterprise Fund budget for expenses in the amount of $688,987 dollars and revenue in the amount of $688,787 dollars. So the expenses are $688,787? Yeah. Sorry, did I misspeak? Yeah, $688,787. Sorry. Sorry. Any further questions? Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The actuals don't match perfectly, as you'll notice, but when you're budgeting, you balance it out. Otherwise, he'd either be budgeting a deficit or a surplus, which just wouldn't be a thing. So it's just that it's a budget, as it's supposed to be. It sort of has to be a balanced budget. And if you notice, under the actuals, there is a balance of $9,000, $15,000, which is the difference. It's funny, they look negative, but they're actually positive. You don't want those numbers to not be in parentheses. That's where his retained earnings come from. Michael and then Grant.</blockquote>

So the infrastructure improvements, whether it's Zamboni or improving the electrical plant in the arena, all those improvements over the years have been in the capital budget. And then apparently will continue to be in the capital budget. And so at least in my memory, there was an agreement between the Recreation Department and the Capital Planning Committee that the town would pay a certain portion of the debt service and a certain portion of the debt service would come out of the retained earnings out of the enterprise fund. And that's what you see here. So that's debt service. So the actual expenditures might be $500,000 or something like that's being paid over a number of years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just going back to debt service, if you look at the capital plan, there are offsets from the rec and rink that match what's in the enterprise fund. So the enterprise fund says an expenditure of $56,000 for the debt service. It comes back to the capital plan as an offset. It's all in your account. Well, I mean, the capital plan is where the money is borrowed. And the debt service gets transferred to the capital plan and the rink. But it's certainly an offset. But if you look at the capital plan, you'll see lines for rink and rink debt service. Do you know when we retired that debt? Probably always something there, because you're replacing the Zamboni every certain number of years. And I think the last one was for the interior city for replacing the Zamboni. That was a big one. Yeah, you'd have to look at the capital plan literally and see. And then probably Alex was carrying a line in the debt service. It's probably in the audit for the SEO firm. I think there's a page in the capital plan that has a debt service by the department. I mean, in the capital report. It's not necessarily right in the public report. I don't know where it is. It's actually in the finance section. Ed Burns Arena Enterprise Fund has debt outstanding at a year under $375,000. Now it made $55,000 in principal payments during the year. Thank you.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 15</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, we have another budget. I think it's recreation department, which is on 185.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rebecca Younkin - 982</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is the same department, again, Joe Connelly, with a similar budgeting strategy. He started our meeting by telling us that this year, 2023, he felt went great and he was able to add a couple hundred thousand dollars back to the reserves. So the retained earnings, the recreation department is $1,342,424. You're going to be hearing more about that in a minute because we plan to use some of that. In general, he says the demand for recreation department programs is very high. The registrations are way up. He expects the actuals for fiscal year 2024 to track, basically. And yeah, he watches every month and sees the trend of generally the revenue going up due to the demand for the programs. The big change that they're expecting in the recreation department this year is that the kid care programs, which are a preschool program and an afterschool program for K to 5 or K to 6, are going to be moving back to the, or moving to the parmenter school. So you may recall the parmenter school has been temporarily used to house the public preschool, Monomony Preschool. That's a branch of the Arlington Public Schools. They've been using it during the rebuild. So it's in decent shape. It's been used as a preschool. But now that the public preschool has been moved into the high school building, the parmenter is turning over to the recreation department. So he is planning to use a sizable chunk of his reserves. If you look at that, use of retained earnings, the very bottom of page 188, there's a very large use of retained earnings. And a lot of this is toward the upgrade of the parmenter in order to house preschool and afterschool there, but also to expand the capacity significantly. So there's a significant demand in town for the kind of preschool program that the rec department runs in very reasonable in price compared with some of the things in town. So he said it compares favorably to, well, it's comparable to things like the Boys and Girls Club Preschool or the Fidelity House Preschool being at least somewhat affordable to many families. So he's hoping that once they move into the parmenter and have a year or two of transitional year, they expect to expand their, basically double their preschool enrollment, expand their afterschool, which is currently running its sham by 40%, and then be able to use some of the space that will be afterschool programming for elementary school children. So he'll use that in the K-Town for programming for toddlers. So they will also make revenue for that. He does expect when they move the preschool and afterschool to the new facility, he's going to have some need for additional staffing to support what he calls a classroom model. So right now in the afterschool, they have all the kids in one big gym space. And it's fairly easy to maintain appropriate ratio for licensing purposes if you just have a certain amount of adults and a whole pile of kids. But once you separate them out into classrooms by age, and you have younger kids here, middle grades, older kids, he's going to need some increased staffing in order to maintain the ratios. So when you look at these budgets, the no school things include the fact that the use of retained earnings, as we talked about, is going to go way up in order to expand. Another one thing we notice on the salary page, which is 189, one person who had a fairly significant raise was the last employee as the co-director of KidCare. KidCare is the preschool and afterschool. Previously, they had a model of a director and an assistant director, but they promoted that person to be a co-director. Hence their raise. Let's see. What else can I tell you? Oh, yeah. One of the things that you'll notice if you're looking at expenses on the rec side is you'll see a bunch of blank lines, and then you'll see lines that say fall CR and COR and TPS on and so forth. He's still in the process of transferring his budget to a model where he's keeping track of the cost and the income from contracted services versus in-house supported services and giving him a finer grained look at which things make money and which don't. And I think he also said he was going to get a little bit of money back on the move to Armenter because he's actually paying full rent for that building. He's probably taking on some maintenance expenses, and there will probably be some kind of fee to the town, something, gray bill. But he's getting out of a rented space for the preschool. So I think he really sees that as an area of future growth for the rec department for both earnings and for providing that service to the town at a reasonable cost. And we did ask, as Rebecca said, he's comparing himself to other relatively low cost preschools. He's not trying to run this like a private business deal. He is trying to continue to be a public service, which I thought was kind of important. And not seeing it as this big profit center and making a ton of money, but it makes it a service for adults, people in town who might not be able to pay for a fancy private program. Just to add to that, the rent on the Mass Ave storefront where they currently run a preschool is about $40,000. So they can't do that. Let me get that back. Those were the highlights. We have a motion. So I would like to move the budget for the recreation department enterprise fund with expenses in the amount of $2,632,205 and revenues of $2,632,205. Second? Second. Questions?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 390</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie, Sophie, Grant. Thank you, Madam Chair. So Rebecca, did you say what the balance was in the enterprise fund? Yes, for the recreation department, it's $1,342,424. This was last June. No, that's a live number when he asked me. OK. So the lending is that he's got about three and a half years to be able to use this $450,000 to repay his earnings. So he does not, the $450,000 is a temporary bump up due to the lending to the preschool. So eventually, this is about the transition, more so than the $450,000 every year. So because he was actually, a couple of years ago, he was producing $300,000 a year in a retained earnings system. That's right. So let's see, do you have the number for last year, what the balance was? He could have had $22,000, $23,000, $25,000 or more. I don't think that he anticipates that, in talking to him about this, he felt like he was being cautious, just that he might need to use that money. He might have some service 8 and 6 to do when he moved in. And he also has this need to possibly increase staff or increase his staff's credentials. But he's also expanding capacity. He just can't predict the income from that capacity until it fills up. It turns out that the, we're not in preschool, is no longer necessarily going to have slots for teachers who've been bringing their kids there. And so he may get some business from high school teachers, who have been using that preschool, that then come to his preschool instead. And I think they expanded capacity. So I think his feeling was, he might not use the 450, but he wanted to be safe on his budget, and that it's a one-shot deal. He's not going to use it every year to support that program. That program is going to support itself after that capacity kicks in and he's starting to earn what he thinks it can earn. And Joe's a pretty smart guy. And I think he would pivot if he didn't feel like it was sustainable or profitable. If it helps to add to that, he also said that his best guess is that after he uses that 450,000, he will return at least $200,000 to the retained earners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophie. I'm going back to what I had asked our town manager. Is kid care limited to Arlington residents, or is there a priority for Arlington residents? We didn't ask about that. I hadn't thought about it before, but as I was seeing all these numbers, the variety of increases, and it's actually something we pay for in our budget, right? No, actually, this is not a preschool. Pays for itself. Pays for itself. All the rec programs pay for themselves, period. So all of rec and rec is. That's the point of the anniversary fund. I mean, if we were supporting it, you would see a line called transfer of funds. And the transfer from general fund is zero for rec this year, and it was zero for rec this year. So. Is that even for salaries? Even for salaries? And health insurance? Yes, all that. It's health insurance. OK. Yeah. Just to foreshadow for some of the other enterprise funds, some of the other enterprise funds do get a transfer from the general fund. So you'll see that maybe next week. These two are self-supporting. Which isn't a reason for him not to prioritize Arlington residents. I would like that he try to prioritize Arlington residents. Maybe that he does. I just, it didn't come up in the meeting. Anymore? Sure. And it makes sense that, sure. That's a good balance. Sure. Sure. Well, we're going to vote the budget anyways, right?

And I'm just curious, is it not budgeting for it or combining it into supplies? I think it's combined, yes. Or are we not doing it? It's combined into supplies. Still using it for rent. All right, thank you. Al? The manager's increase is over a $20,000 increase in field maintenance. And it's not in the DPW budget. I'm just wondering if it's, I can't find it in this budget. I'm just wondering where that got flipped. Oh, that's weird. It should be in DPW. Maybe in contracted services. It's probably in contracted services and natural resources. In the contracted services? OK, because there's a separate line of field maintenance. It's $60,000. I think that that is somewhere else. Yeah, I think that line item is the actual budget on what it's due. And then the contracted services, you know. OK, so I'll check with that. Thank you. All right, so I think we need to go back. Back to the question that I put on tonight for some reason. What about, so health insurance is covered. What about workers' comp insurance or insurance in case of, I mean, in all these kids, like I worry about kids getting hurt or whatever. There's a town liability bill that wouldn't be covered. That is a good question. I do not know that there's not a line for it here. I just, and I wonder, because a lot of preschools, private preschools, carry probably a lot more insurance related to working with children, you know, or something. How is the town covered on things like that? Ask that of the HR director when we do insurance. Workers' comp insurance is in the HR budget. Right, and so I guess there are two insurance questions, really, right? Workers' comp, and then if there's an accident with a child, what are liability insurances related to this program? And other, I mean, I'm sure there are waivers, I think. I know, at least for activities, right, parents sign waivers. I don't know that KidCare, when it's a full-time preschool program. We didn't ask about that. We didn't ask about that, but if you can inquire, and Carolyn, if you can inquire. And that one, trust.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the assessors report. This is it. OK. So. 51. 52. OK. So for one of the assessors, next page. We had a meeting yesterday. Charlie and I met with Dana Mann, the director of assessments. Next slide. Sorry. Some basic data just on this. We had about 15,500 parcels, 24,460 households, which is a number I'm sure many people know at this point, 400 businesses, and then a breakdown of about 8,001 families, 4,100 condos, 2,002 families, 273 families, and about 1,124 of many other types, many other living unit codes. This is the assessor's budget. So I'll go through the lines on this. This is just a call to action on there. So let's go to the next slide, and I'll just go through the line items. Our first positions, the positions were stable. There was nobody that either left or came or built new positions. And I still verified the steps against declassification, and Dana told me he actually went for the union contract, made sure all the steps were OK. So that's good. Next, please. The line items, and that's going to be hard to read, so I'll just say it loudly. So the stipends are, yes, another clothing allowance from the union contract. The auto allowance is because the inspectors actually have to go around and visit properties, so they can build their $0.67 a mile. Computer maintenance is the Patriot software, which has two components, one called computer. Assisted Mass Appraisal, or CAMA, which is their system for the inputs, creating evaluations, and then some you may be familiar with is the online web pro where you can look up resonances and so abatement requesters can actually do like some real searches on that, you know, saying we're studying colonials and this age and all the other things, and obviously other people can do that too. The in-state travel is conferences and training for Dana and the deputy data collector, rather, Mr. Suarez. Consulting is mainly when things go to the appellate tax board, and I'll explain that process a little bit. At that point, they may need counsel and possibly an expert witness. As Dana said, he's well-versed in this stuff, but when you have to go to court, you need somebody with all the qualifications, and they have a stable of people that they've used for that. He also did warn that 2025 is a recertification year, so that means lots of reports to the DOR, and he may have to purchase some consultation from Patriot for that. And then finally, the otherwise unclassified is, as he said, was the time clock stamp service and some printer cartridges. So next slide. So that's the budget part. The abatements. So he said as of now, there's 43 requested. The deadline is actually tomorrow, so there were 43 last year. I asked, you know, how many will go to the Board of Assessors, and how many will get modified? He said about a dozen. He also said about a dozen will get appealed to the appellate tax board. Those tend to be large commercial properties, because otherwise it's not worth it, because there's just not enough of a tax discrepancy there to fund things. If it goes there, it gets negotiated. They use the comparative sales model, which is a real estate appraisal, but also the net operating income of commercial property. Both of those can be used too, but it basically means there'll probably be some worst rating, and they'll figure out a number in the middle. And then that's it. You actually can't go to the court. He said he's never heard of it, so I suspect that means you can't. Next slide. The overlay account. So this was kind of touched on by the town manager. This is controlled by the Board of Assessors. It funds the abatements, exemptions, any adjustments from the appellate tax board, not the lawyers, because that's funded elsewhere, and any unpaid collections. And it's got about 3.136 million in it. And as you saw, as they mentioned in the lawyer's plan, it adds about 600k to that overlay reserve, which is YG, and then they deduct about 450k of the surplus, so that goes back to revenue. And he said that's about a five-year average. So that's basically just budgeting if they need to. They want to budget a generous number, but it tends to come back. Okay, next slide. Revaluation. So we don't appropriate anything this year. We appropriated 100 grand last year because we had to for the state. That'll be revaluing commercial and industrial properties and reinspecting what they call personal properties in the business. Computers, copy maker, kitchen equipment, whatever. That bid came in much lower than he figured. It was level with 2020, drive against inflation, so 57.3k. And then the market revaluation of properties now happens everywhere. So that's where we are with revaluations. And then the next slide. This is an interesting thing. It's moving to cyclical inspections. So with that 42.7k left over from that appropriation, they would like to, rather than doing all the properties in year nine of the 10-year cycle, because the state requires you to re-inspect every 10 years, they want to use 37k of that, or they're thinking about using 37k of that for doing 1,500 inspections this year. Then 1,500 the next year, and then so on for five years. That would meet the state requirement. And then at that point, they could do 1,750 residents a year. And that'll spread out the cost of this and the effort of this. It can potentially capture new growth sooner, especially in the first five years, because you may be off cycle. After that, it'll be every 10 years, but you're still looking at it. And they said it would probably be a contracting expense. They probably would hire someone for that. So given that change in the inspection model, I think that was worth mentioning. And then finally, well, we mentioned it. When is the override applied? They mentioned this to the town manager, that 50% hits the August and November tax bills, and 50% could have in May 2025. Many of you may already know that, but the thousands of people who are listening to this recording. And that's it. Thank you. And questions? Do you have a motion? Oh, actually, sorry, I have to make a motion. So I move the taxation total of $344,942. Second.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any questions? Sophie? I don't remember if we've asked this in the past, but on the assessors themselves on the salary line, three of them, we have salaries, is that tied to them being elected? Or is that, what's the, I mean, compared to other commission, you know, committees and things that don't. It's significant, they each get $5,000 minus $100,000.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. I mean, it's a stipend, I think. It's like, you know, the select board gets a certain amount, school committee gets a certain amount, that's just the amount that they get. I was just curious, because I was told they only meet like once a month. I'm wondering, do you know how much time they spend in it? Well, I started a fight between that, but I'm just, you know, added up, it's 15,000, when we're talking about positions or things like that. Yeah, I didn't ask. I'm not sure how comfortable he would have been. I could tell you what works for the select board. And it's a small stipend compared to the amount of time you're generally putting in. And it has not gone up in decades, and neither has the select board's stipend. But the difference is, we see them on TV. We know what the school committee does, at least on camera, and much more than that. We know what the select board does on camera, and much more than that. Well, they have more meetings, too, at the select board. So what the assessors are doing is, when a taxpayer comes to them and says, you're charging me two months tax, they're, I believe this is true, they're assessing whether or not that person has a case. Okay, so that is a big part of the job. And then supervising and hiring the directors. Actually, not anymore. Well, they don't hire them directly, but they are. They're very intelligent. Also, the assessors can also hear financial hardship cases. Yes. So, no, I didn't ask. I can kind of ask, you know, like, just roughly, how much is he seeing? Because I'm pretty sure he's going to be involved with most of what they're doing. So he would probably have a pretty good beat on, like, you know, how often do they meet, how many hours a month, things like that. But, you know, at the same time, whatever professional rate they might charge, it's probably going to get restructured fast.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Any more questions? Or Telfer? What's the point of all this information on the topic? Yes. Go ahead. Okay. I just saw the $4,900. It used to be $5,000. And it's by a bylaw many, many years ago. These are the three elected positions. If it was $5,000, they'd be entitled to retirement and health insurance. And a few years ago, they dropped it to a little less $100, $4,900. They're not entitled to retirement purposes. You'd like it and they're not entitled to any more health insurance. Same thing for the people coming on the board of Slack or the school committee. So that benefit has been taken away. Charlie, how do you find that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's. Well, I would just note that I had a little discussion with one of the assessors about 30 years ago, Dan Purcell. He was a little crotchety old guy. First thing he wanted to know was what my address was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't believe the current members would ask you that question, Charlie. I'm just telling you this. It's a touchy subject. Any more questions? All right. We have a motion. It's been seconded. All in favor say yes. Any opposed? All right. Yes. Thank you. </blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know fire and police will be ready on Monday. Everybody else will be ready on Monday. I'll just remember the answer to a question that came up about libraries. Would you like me to answer now? Will anyone else have budgets ready on Monday? I should have HHS. Okay. I should have HHS. I may have to confirm that. All right. So we will have a bunch of budgets on Monday. Rebecca, you have an answer to the question. Alan, you have a question about why the FOX offset shows up on the budget and the other offsets do not show up. And I remember the answer to that, which is that the FOX shop, one of their missions is to partially support one of the children's libraries. It's because that little amount of money goes towards salaries, towards all the other outside money for support materials. That would be it. And that rent debt service does show up in the capital report, not the blueprint that we have. Is there a motion to adjourn? So moved. All in favor? Aye. Thank you.</blockquote>
