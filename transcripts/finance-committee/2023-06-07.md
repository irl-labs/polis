> So, it's knowledge that reminding ourselves of that conversation. We have. All right, so we have so the select board voted on Monday night to put a $7 million override on the ballot on the ballot. At the same time, they made certain commitments. As to how it will be sent. All right, so we have so the select board voted on Monday night to put a $7 million override on the ballot on November 7th. At the same time, they made certain commitments. As to how it will be sent. Now, very simplistically. Two sides. One side is this override is going to further worsen the structural deficit, increase spending, which is going to be baked in, making it much more expensive. In terms of further future overrides. The other side is that the town is in the business of providing services, and it's unreasonable to think that we can continue year after year after year without having a need to deliver additional or other types of services. Those simplistically are the two sides to this. Both sides I think there are reasons. I think I think you can agree that there's, there's some truth in both sides. So I think we should also keep that in mind. With each other about whether to support or oppose this override. And also, just keep in mind, just maybe whatever side you're on will come around to maybe just maybe you may be wrong. So keep that in mind, as well as talk with each other. So, I will. First of all, I will explain what generally what the commitments. The select board have made are open it up to. I think Charlie has a presentation. Someone else wants something that they want to present as well. Allow that then we'll have a discussion. And when we have a discussion right please raise your hand don't jump in. And I'm looking at you any but you know. I'm going to try to recognize everyone that I'm going to try to make sure that everyone wants to. All right, so it's not all the way close it's not there's a flashing. Yeah. All right, so these are the commitments. I don't read them to you. I'll just summarize. There will be no exercise this discipline and provide quality services commitments no override prior to. Continue to increase general education operating budgets by 3.5% annually continue to increase general government operating budgets by 3.25% annual funds special ed growth at a rate of 6.5% per year. I have to respond to ongoing school enrollment fluctuations on future enrollment increases or decreases at a rate of 50% per pupil. I am three invest for this is where this is where the money is going to go. For the schools to fund the school committee's strategic strategic plan that we heard about last week. There will be the following schedule of increases to base operating for FYI 24 $1 million for FYI 25 $3.1 million for FYI 26 $1.7 million for FYI 27 600,000 for FYI 28 300,000. FYI 24 increase, which is 1 million will replace the current FYI 24 one time increase of 600,000, and the FYI 25 increase will replace the current FYI one time increase of 300,000. That was already in budget. The town will use $200,000 to add to the base budget for pedestrian infrastructure including road and sidewalk repair. Another $250,000 will be allocated for DPW to help cover defray costs of the whatever the next trash contract will be, and add $150,000 to the annual contribution to the bookhead fund to cover retiree health insurance costs. And then the rest is in my vernacular boilerplate continue new tax relief programs such as breakers, property tax deferral options, pursue new revenue sources, and maintain fiscal reserves at 5%. So that is the select board's commitment to voters as to how that money is going to be spent. And presumably that will be the campaign. Those would be what the campaign would be all about. Any questions so far. If not, then I think I'll turn it over to you, Charlie because you have a presentation.

> Thank you. My screen. I'm going to skip. So, this has been distributed so I'm going to skip most of it was the beginning. I'm just concerned about two things. One is having total transparency with the voters. And secondly, securing long term policies, and by way of a, I don't know what they will, there's a little power in between parentheses in the newspaper articles when the reporters writing about the fact that the guy who's exposing actually something like that, they have a little full disclosure, full disclosure. Okay, thank you. By way of full disclosure. I was involved in the, in the development of the five year plan back in 2005 or so. And I also was co chair of the 2005 override campaign, which basically use the five year plan is the way it's currently being framed to justify the. I will get into the details, I just wanted to get some sort of a Tiffany and change of mind here. I think we all know about how the, how the long range plan assumes a quote unquote required growth of 3.25% of the town and somewhere between three and 6% of the school committee school department depending upon whatever. And keep in mind that the, the law allows without going to the public growth of 2.5% for you. My view is that the recent overrides and currently proposed override. Do not address the deficit, they increase the deficit. So, this is something that is very deeply concerning to me. This is an aside, the growth rate of the tax payer single family tax bill has been 5.1% per year for the past five or six years, versus an annual inflation rate of 2.44%. And I agree that within the last year the inflation picture has changed, but it's pretty hard to compare anything because in some places you know there are constraints where you don't feel the inflation they will feel in the future. Some places have built it already, but the data that goes through 2023 is pretty straightforward, 2022. As a point of interest, the Arlington if you compare it to the town manager 12 communities are taxed per income per capita income growth rate is 3.8%, which is lower than the 5.1% tax growth rate. So, that's just, I think that a point that says that we're spending more than we know in the long term can afford to spend. Another point that I would make is that I compared Arlington spending, this is data from the DOR municipal database, and generally speaking is higher than the town manager 12 general fund spending. There's an enormous amount of data on that, and I won't try to get into the details, but it's shown on that graph. The red line on top is Arlington spending, the gray line is the average of the town manager's 12 pounds, and the blue line is the municipal cost index, which is sort of a national average of spending. So, what I'm concerned about here is stopping what I call deficit spending, and I think our deficit, our approach allows the town, what we've been doing with the five-year planning process is allowing the town to increase the infrastructure cost at a rate that's not supported by taxes that can be assuredly collected. And this builds up the deficit, and the deficit that we're looking at that is driving this whole question of the override is the deficit in 2026, and I believe it's about $8 million. We'll see that later. But the deficit spending assumes that taxpayers in the future are going to rescue the town, and we're not going to have a catastrophic financial situation, which to me is not guaranteed, and in fact, the direction we're going in is almost going to assure a catastrophic position in the future. So, if you look at the table at the bottom here, where it says non-exempt shortfall, that $8,500,000 or $600,000, if we have no override and no debt exclusion, no increased ads or whatever, those three numbers are the deficits in 2026, 2027, and 2028. Those numbers together add up to about $47 million. So, the town has to raise $47 million more just to cover those deficits within the five-year horizon, and that to me is pretty troubling. And by the way, it doesn't mean that we're not going to have more deficits in the future. That's just what has to be raised to cover those deficits. This is, by the way, from, you know, I distributed some versions of Mr. Poole's five-year plan worksheet today, and that's where this data comes from. So, the second issue I have is transparency with the voters, and I think that the statement that Christine read with respect to the select board's commitment ties this promise of new services to solving the deficit problem. But as I will try to show you, it doesn't solve the deficit problem. It increases the deficit problem. So, we have a strange situation where the select board, which is supposed to be the, which is the leading executive authority in the town, is leading us into a more exacerbated deficit situation. I think from a transparent viewpoint, that spending subject should be separate from the overall. Now, okay, I'll just stop there on that subject for now. So, I had a conversation with the town council a couple days ago, and what he said was sort of interesting because, you know, the way that we have worked in this town with respect to the five-year plan over the last number of years is that when the five-year plan comes out of the Long-Range Planning Committee and goes to the Board of Selectmen, it's sort of accepted as gospel. And what I'm going to suggest is that it's not gospel, okay?  And it doesn't represent anything but some political viewpoints of a group of people. Now, what the select board vote the other night, and I was at the select board meeting, does do, and the town council has basically told me this, it sets the override date, which they did, and it sets the override amount on the ballot, $7 million. The vote with respect to commitment on the spending is simply the select board's viewpoint, and the voters decide whether or not to support the $7 million tax levy, and that doesn't mean that they're supporting spending more on the town, the schools, or anything else, okay? What the select board does not do, what their vote does not do, is it doesn't bind the finance committee, it doesn't bind town meeting, it doesn't bind the school committee, and it really doesn't bind the select board because future select boards can change their mind. So it really has, it's a political statement, it has no legal effect on the override referendum. And my view is, and I hope that the finance committee does this as we go forward in the future, we should be evaluating the proposed spending each year on its own merits, and not based on the fact that it exists or does not exist in this five-year plan that was in front of the select board in the last couple of weeks. Now, the manager has proposed to the select board, well, actually, very interestingly, he does say that he didn't propose it, he says it's been proposed by the long-range planning committee, but I would note that the long-range planning committee doesn't take minutes and doesn't take a vote, so I don't quite know where this came from, but nonetheless, $7.3 million, this was included in the select board's vote, so I guess that's where it came from. $7.3 million between the town and the school over the next five years is what they proposed as the increased spending, but it's not $7.3 million, it's really $27.8 million, because the first year's spending sits into the base and gets increased at 2.5% a year, or actually, in our plan, 3.5% a year. And then the next year's $3.1 million goes into the base, and that's increased to 3.5% a year, et cetera. So the total impact is not $7.5 million, the total impact is the sum of all those numbers as they grow in the base over the five years, which in the future value is $27.4 million, $7.5 million, and the net present value is $25 million. That's a substantial number. Now, that's the number that needs to be added to the $46 million or $47 million that's needed to make up the deficit that's already built into the operations. So in total, we're talking about $75 million over the period of the plan in additional taxes. And by the way, I would mention that that's with respect to the 2.5% growth base that is, in other words, sort of automatically assumed under Proposition 2.5, and that's another $22 million. So we're actually talking, from where we are today, we're talking about raising the taxes over five years, $95 million. $97 million, I think it is. This is just a little chart that shows how the deficit increases for people who like pictures. And this chart shows how the taxes increase, what the percentage increase over the base levy is over these five years. And in the fifth year, it gets to be 18% higher than what it is today. So we're not talking about a $7 million increase. We're talking about a substantially higher increase in what the tax levy is going to take away from the citizens of the town. What I did here, okay, so this is interesting. Can you see my person? I can't see my person. All right. The line that says non-exempt shortfall, that is the town manager's basic plan without any override or any additional spending, okay? So that has an $8 million, $8.5 million, $17 million, $20 million deficit in those three years. That gets you to the $47 million that I mentioned before. Now, if we add an override in there, that goes $7 million, and then you increase that 2.5% a year, so that builds up to $7,720,000 by fiscal 2020. Notice that we still have a deficit in fiscal 28, $10.1 million, without any additional spending. So just as a sort of a Gedanken experiment here, I said, OK, let's reduce the base expenses by 1%. So if we reduce the base expenses by 1%, we can sort of stay in the black by 2028. The message is that what we should be focused on is controlling expenses, not what the date of the next overwrite is. I forgot what I had in mind in this slide here. Well, I think what I did is I said, if we took out the one-time benefits that we had from COVID in ARPA and had nooverwrites and no AEDs, what's the rate of spending versus what we legally can collect without an additional overwrite?  And that's what's shown on the bottom of this slide is a sort of informational piece of data. But it means that the spending is actually at a level of $68.6 million if we didn't have some of the one-time benefits in 2023 and 2024. So my concern is that we need to have, both for the benefit of the taxpayers and the benefit of the professional staff in the town and the school, some stability in our finances. And the direction that we're going in is not to have stability, but is to increase the deficit, which I think I'm just fundamentally opposed to. And I say that having been on the other side of the fence at one time. So my recommendation is I think if we can do it, and I don't exactly have a clear way of saying this right now, but I think that we as a finance committee ought to consider rejecting the override without a select board commitment to reduce spending, to somehow control the growth of spending, which we're just not doing. And then I think we should, without getting into the details of the benefits of each and every, I don't want to try to debate in one slide here the proposed strategic plan of the school department. But I think that we should reject this proposal on a long-term basis, and only offer support on a year-by-year basis if town management and school management control other cuts, other spending, have some sort of constraint, and evaluate each year's spending block that the strategic plan is looking for on its own merits, as opposed to sitting here and saying, OK, we're going to give you a blank check of $7.3 million for the next five years. That's, to me, not the way I think the finance committee should be handling it. By the way, the school is not $7.3 million. The school is about 6 point something. The town is $600,000. And I also think that we should increase the, we should reject the town's pre-spending proposal outright. I mean, I think they made those numbers up so that they would have something to say that the override is benefiting both the town and the school. They could get along without that $600,000, and the world would not end. So in summary, our taxes, by the way, the 5.1% a year tax increases that I mentioned earlier includes both non-exempt and exempt taxes. And we should keep in mind that those exempt tax expenses are not going to go away, because invariably, the town is going to want to do something about the Fox Library, or Otteson Junior High School, and there's going to be more major projects that are going to have to be funded with debt exclusions. So that's where the 5% comes from. That number is going to continue to be higher than the 2.5%. I don't think we should be funding the services with a new higher spending, preservation of services. And I would really like to see this town and school leaders give more consideration to protecting the taxpayers from excessive increases. And I think the solution here is that we should have an override every year. And if they want to spend more than the Proposition 2.5, let's let the voters have their say on it. And if the voters say yes, that's fine. If they say no, don't do it. That's my outlook. So thank you for your time. I hope I wasn't too long-winded.

> If we were in a town that had annual balanced budgets, or at least close, you know, where you're jiggling at the end and getting it set, I'd probably support the override. What the school and town departments are asking for is not unreasonable. Unfortunately, we're not. We're in a town that regularly runs operating deficits that are periodically eliminated by overrides. It's sort of a failed plan, but it's gotten us through. And if you look at the long-range financial projections, we face substantial deficits beginning in fiscal 26. I mean, we're talking about $9 million, $9.5 million. It varies a little bit. $17 million, $20 million. Huge. I mean, for a town of our size, just to keep what we have, just so we don't have to weigh off policemen or firemen or teachers, or closed services. That's what we face. And in 2005 and 2011, partially maybe in 2019, that's what overrides were for. So we could keep maintaining the services we have without cuts. And the voters have always stepped to the front. We're going to need a substantial deficit or a substantial override in two years just to keep what we have. And this override is not affecting that. We're going to need an override. Maybe it delays a year, but we're needing two overrides, this one and then another one in two or three years. I am concerned that this proposed override will hurt the next override that we really need. This override is for new spending, not to cover the deficits. I believe that the current five-year plan with the amounts going to the town and school can serve both well going forward. I think the schools can make substantial progress within the current framework that they have in getting their available share that they already get. And for example, I brought it up when the schools came in on the 31st. They put forth a proposal earlier when the schools originally presented to us which showed about $1.5 million available from their share of what they get and about another $1.3 million, $1.4 from efficiencies in their budget. And they had $2.8 million for basically new programs going forward for fiscal 24, next year's budget. That's a lot of money. Now, I'm not saying that they're going to come up with $1.3 million of new efficiencies every year. But they're spending $80 or $90 million. They can keep looking and keep looking. They can make substantial progress within the plan that exists now. It'll just take longer. And maybe we just have to have a little bit more patience. So Charlie went through all the numbers. Those are my thoughts. I've supported every override and debt exclusion since 2090. God. And I led the override for the first successful of the debt exclusion for the first example rebuild of the elementary schools, along with Charlie Lyons and Barbara Griffin. I cannot support this override. I don't think there's a need for it. And I'm really fearful it could undercut the need for the major override that we're going to need in two or three years that we really need. So that's my two cents. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Annie LaCourt - 1095</summary>

> Annie. So I want to start by reminding everybody of a couple of things. The first thing is that this override is going on the ballot. Our vote doesn't stop it or start it. Our vote is a vote that, in past campaigns, has been deemed as necessary to indicate whether or not the FinCon was with it, with the override, in order to see whether or not the override was likely to be successful. So this is a political vote. It's not a fiscal responsibility or a fiscal irresponsibility, but it's a symbolic vote on our part to say where we stand on the responsibility of the override. The second thing I want to remind everybody of is the conversation we had with Sandy Kuhler, where Sandy Kuhler went through a spreadsheet and showed how the future deficits shrink over time because of our conservative approach to budgeting. Because we don't budget for what all of our experience of revenue predicts the revenue is going to be, but we budget based on some conservative rules that we have set that we believe are safe, so that we never have a year where we have less income than we expect, and that we often have income we didn't expect from new growth, et cetera, et cetera, come in and make a difference. And then there are turnbacks in spending. If DPW is understaffed and can't plant 300 trees instead of 150, they don't spend that money. If it's turned back, it becomes part of our reserves and one to certify that it's later spent. So those future predictions can't be seen as 100% accurate. They are likely to be smaller. Before you start thinking I'm an optimist, and certainly as a sales force consultant, I'm not an optimist, and I don't think that we're going to cut that deficit to zero and we can't count on cutting it as much as we have seen patterns in the past. But we're likely to cut it some. So I'm less worried about those deficits than Alex. I also want to say something about past overrides. We passed an override in 2005, and at the point when we passed that override, our first five-year plan override, we had already made huge cuts in the schools. We had cut all the elementary librarians, all the elementary art teachers. We cut language programs, science board members, reading interventionists, and cross-education. And some of those things got added back because of private fundraising for a year, and some of those things got added back slowly over time. And some of those things have never come back and are now in the strategic plan. So the schools underwent major cuts, and those have not been restored. And we don't provide services in our schools that are provided in schools and other communities. So principally, well, then, where Ms. Holman comes from, where Dr. Holman comes from. We don't need to protect the taxpayers from the town. The taxpayers are the town. These are services for those taxpayers. And the question is, do they want to support the addition of these services? Do they want to support this override? If they really don't want to support an override and add services, we're going to know, and we're going to take another bite at the apple with less money than you're coming up. And that's kind of how it's going to go. In terms of the increase in our expenses, if you look at our contractual obligations, our obligation to educate children with special education needs, our obligations to healthcare, and our obligations to pensions, if we limit ourselves to increasing the budget, the overall budget by 2.5% every year, we will be cutting services every year. And indeed, between 2005 and 2011, that was our experience. Despite the fact that we were able to put some things back in the schools because of the override, we then almost every year were cutting the school budget because we didn't differentiate between special education costs and general education, and the schools had to pay the special education costs, which were increasing wildly, and therefore we were cutting services in the schools every year. And I'm acutely aware of this because I had kids in the schools at the time. Now, I have a daughter who has a BFA in art, and she went through the Arlington schools, but she did not get her art education in the Arlington schools. She got her art education because her parents were able to afford to supplement her education. Somewhere during the course of her education, there was another kid in this town who had just as much talent, whose parents didn't have that money. And they also didn't get the kind of art education they might have from the Arlington schools. And you can just go and add that up by every single department, every area. The reason that my oldest daughter got reading intervention in the elementary school was because we privately fundraised for it through the Arlington Educational Foundation. So we can have whatever we want as a town if we're willing to pay for it. The question that has to be put before the voters is what do you want and are you willing to pay for it? So we're not protecting the taxpayers from anything other than possibly slightly increasing their expenses so they can have some services that otherwise will cost them a lot more money. When we ask them for an override and they have the right to turn us down. So I support this override. I'm gonna vote yes on this override. I don't guarantee you that the town is gonna support yes on this override, but if we honestly make an honest campaign and an honest argument about these services and what's needed, then I expect that we will get an honest vote. And that's all I'm asking for tonight is that we make our vote with the proposition in mind that the final decision makers are the voters and not us. And that there's nothing fiscally irresponsible about saying to somebody, if you want something, this is what it costs and you need to provide the tax dollars to cover that. We don't deficit spend. We're not allowed to deficit spend by law. We go to our voters and say, if you wanna continue to receive these services, then this is what they are going to cost. And that's where I'm standing on this. So sorry for the emotion.

<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 17</summary>

> Thank you, Annie. Where were we standing? Well, it's to me. John and Alan and then over.
</details>
<details><summary>	 John Griffin - 499</summary>

> Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I actually like this override because I think it's relatively modest, certainly competitive, the second one that was proposed and certainly also smaller than the one that the taxpayers approved back in 2019, where they actually approved three different overrides. So I think this would be, as it says the average taxpayer will get hit with a $464 increase, which seems reasonable. Of course, no one really likes an override, but why is this one okay? And it's exactly what Charlie said, $47 million deficit, that's pretty scary. So to ignore that $47 million deficit, I think would be irresponsible. But one thing, just as much as I think this override is okay, I think the additional spending is terrible. And I almost wanna say as loud as we possibly could, that no, override, okay. That means we start getting $7 million a year immediately. So that'd be seven, 14, 21, 28. So they go 47 million deficit minus the 28 million of additional spending. All of a sudden the deficit's only 20. That's, of course, my back to the envelope calculation. Leave it to the professionals. Professionals say the conservative approach shows the deficit goes down to 11.3 million. That's conservative. Or maybe a little bit more optimistic, the deficit actually disappears. Just with that additional $7 million, all of a sudden problem solved. As long as we say, no way, Jose, no more spending, Zippo. So I would like to say yes on the seven million, no, capital A and capital O, no on the additional spending. I know Charlie said it a little bit differently. He said, no on the override unless they commit to reducing spending. That's kind of the neighborhood I'm in. However, whatever message we can say, whatever message we can send is clearly to keep the spending down is what I would be in favor of. And also one final point is, I think it seems like there's not a lot of clarity on what this additional $7 million spending comes from, what the legal authority for it is. I know that the town meeting didn't appropriate the funds. I'm not sure the selectmen can appropriate the funds. So it seems like it's more symbolic. So how do you even reject something that's symbolic? I'm not sure, but I would want to take those steps to reject that symbolic additional spending. That's where I stand. Yes, start getting the additional $7 million in immediately. As Amy said, it's already on the ballot. Let's just put our weight and support behind it. And then we can feel a lot better about the deficits, but send the message out, no more spending, not this six or seven million that was attached, not the six or seven million that the school committee came and presented on. I'm sure those are great programs, but we can't have everything. So again, just in summary, yes on the override, no on the additional spending.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Alan Jones - 700</summary>

> Mostly commentary on what's been said before. First of all, I think. vote is more than just symbolic. Because it would be, for example, if the Finance Committee voted to not support the override, it would be hypocritical if we, if the override passed and we voted to support all the ads and things that, you know, that was committed to by the select board and said that only town meeting can appropriate the money. We make the recommendation of town meeting. So we could, I think, I'm not sure exactly how to communicate what you're saying and what could be done for that, whether it's better to say we can't support the override because we can't support these ads or say, okay, we support the override to dig us out of a hole, we're not going to support these ads. In our recommendations of town meeting, all in all it's town meeting, substitute votes, whatever. The other thing, another thing that's sort of bothered me in all these projections is that the, we show these accumulated deficits growing every year, but that's really not the way it works because we can't, as Andy said, we can't deficit spend. So, for example, one of Charlie's scenarios is an 8.6 million dollar deficit net by 26. Well, no, there's not. We cut the budget by 8.6. If we don't have that money, we cut the budget by 8.6 million, which means that 8.6 million doesn't carry to the next year, it doesn't get added to, and then the next year if we have another 8 million, that gets cut. So, these, you know, we're showing the deficit as if deficit spending is allowed and we're growing this debt, but that's not the way it works. So, it becomes incremental cuts rather than, you know, falling off a cliff at the end. And that leads to me to support Charlie's notion of an annual override. Now, I had some relationships in Mantucket, and Mantucket tends to have annual overrides, and they have menu overrides. They'll have an override for $20,000 to rebuild the town called Stephen. I mean, if you look at their overrides, they'll have like six items on it, and they do it annually. It's a regular part, and it's sort of a referendum. Should we put in a curb cut here? Should we buy a new firetruck?  Whatever. They're very granular. I'm not sure we should do that, but the political impact of what we've been doing where we have a big override that fills a bucket and then it slowly leaks out is that we have an override every four, five, six years or maybe three years, and when that override happens, if it doesn't pass, it's huge. It's a major, you know, it's a crisis. With the annual overrides, you have, you split that crisis in five or whatever, so you can make smaller adjustments. If the economy's bad and people don't approve an override, it's less of a hit. I think what we're doing is what I call, you know, pushing the cliff down the road because we're not eliminating a cliff. We're just delaying a cliff. If we had annual overrides, we could decide incrementally, again, based on the state of the economy and things that are going on, just approve the annual override, and then going back to Al's point about we're not, the override is proposed. You know, it's like the weather. Everybody complains about the structural deficit, but no one wants to do anything about it. It would be really difficult to support an override that doesn't have a commitment from the select board to do something to reduce the structural deficit, show something that's bending the curve so we're just not approaching bigger and bigger cliffs every so often. So, you know, in short, I support John's notion of being able, you know, potentially supporting an override by opposing the select board's commitments, which, again, are a political statement. I support Charlie's notion of supporting an annual override, and again, that vote isn't on the table, but there's a reason to make a comment on it. So, anyway, thank you.

> So, I guess I'll start with this yearly override notion, since that's been put up. I do not understand how that would work. I believe the contracts with our unions are typically three years, so, you know, I think that's a major factor in our budgets. The major factor is, if you want to call it a deficit. And so, I'm not really sure how that would work. I also don't know what it would do to the political climate of Cal to have a pretty much constant state of fighting about overrides. That's my thought on that. Going back to transparency to the voters, I think you also have to be transparent about what goes away or what happens if it doesn't get floated through. You know, inflation, as we sort of alluded to, is higher now, and when we were looking at even the various ads that had, you know, other towns have gotten through a strike, you know, I think it's still less than the rate of inflation, and I don't think that it's going to be reasonable to ask our employees to, you know, not at least get a cost of living in their contracts. And that's, they suck, but that's how it is. I mean, and we don't know where inflation will go, but it's been higher. You know, we've had a long time, I mean, two and a half worked at all. It was never repealed by the voters because we've had low inflation for a very long time. I think I was in high school the last time it was a real problem. So, you know, I don't see, you know, and so if we don't do some of this stuff, you know, I think we will have labor unrest. We will destroy a lot of trust that the school committee has worked hard to build, and I have pretty good knowledge of when there was not good trust with the AA and the school committee a dozen or so years ago. I'm seeing a little longer than that. You know, they mentioned closing the achievement gap. If we're patient about that while those kids don't get another shot at that. One thing that we only glanced on was COVID spending and taking it away. I would say that if we took it away, if it wasn't there, it wouldn't have been spent in the first place. So I don't know if it really contributed to a deficit, but the schools are still recovering from that. And we were all sick of it. I understand that, but they're still recovering from it. And I think, you know, they're going to have, they're still trying to get back to that. And I think the schools do have a plan for how they want to spend the money, even if you don't agree with it or agree with all of it. But I mean, a big part of that plan, I think, is investing in our teachers and staff. And that to me is, you know, Calvin brought up, you know, the power of the low paid employees. And, you know, then that's like 20% of them. That was a big, I did not realize that it was that many. So, you know, I think we have to remember there's people on the other side of this besides just the taxpayer. And so those are my thoughts. Thank you.

> I'd like to think our vote is significant and not neosymbolic. And part of the ways I would think that is that if there's any voters that are undecided, they say, well, what did the finance committee do? And if they, you know, if we rejected override, they'll think that if we support it, that's a factor too. So I think it isn't just symbolic. I also don't know how much the message would fall on not necessarily deaf ears, but ears that aren't required to listen. I do have a question. How would we, we could recommend, I suppose, a yearly override, but what mechanism would enable that to happen? Would it be a town ward article? Okay. And you do it a year in advance so that you never fall behind. Right. And what would enact that to the select recommendation by the finance committee? I'm sorry. I know it's sort of an open-ended question, but maybe someone can answer it. I can't hear any of the responses, but anyway, that's my, that's my Only the select board can put an override question on the ballot and it is entirely their decision. No one can force them to do that. People can urge them to do that. But it is their decision.

<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 109</summary>

> All right. Well, thank you for that. So I do think that if it's not a yearly basis, it becomes a little bit, I don't want to say transparent, easier to digest because people get to see it's sort of like a cash basis instead of an accrual basis or something. I mean, it does seem a little bit more elementary than, you know, the seven years of famine and save up for that sort of stuff. But I do think that would be a good avenue to pursue. Not sure how I'm going to vote on the override though. Thank you. Carolyn and then Jennifer and then Mike.

<details><summary>	 Carolyn White - 513</summary>

> So, so when I look back at the school department and school committee's presentation, their first priority is ensuring equity and excellence. And their second priority is valuing all staff. And one of the things that's happening in town and has been over the last decade and will continue is that many of the jobs in town are now filled, now the profession is filled by graduate level staff. Librarians are graduate level staff. Much of the town administrators are graduate level staff. Our payments to the staff are often, when I look at the budgets, equivalent to private industry. Or if not equivalent, rather close to private industry when you add in the benefits they're getting. When we look at these teachers' numbers, particularly the TAs, the numbers are 60% below. Len said that himself. He said these numbers are 60% below. And in the case of the TAs, they will remain 60% below, even with this. When I look at the programs that they have, which are priority three and four, those programs have numbers that are exorbitantly higher than the numbers for the salaries. And I suspect it's because they're hiring graduate level people to do that work. My concern, and it has been my concern for a decade, is that we're doing a very good job of paying our town employees who have graduate degrees equal salaries at the expense of those who are not at an undergraduate or even, or between high school and undergraduate, and even those at the undergraduate level. It is a way, it is one of the reasons we are ending up in deficits. And some would say that, well, but we need librarians who have graduate degrees. But if we're going to have graduate librarians at every school, that is why, Charlie, you see that huge increase in the salaries of librarians. I would like to see the town do something different. We can't compete with Cambridge. We can't compete with Lexington. We can't even compete with Waltham because they all have huge industry and corporate structure and tax bases. We will always be a town that has people who move to places like Lexington and Cambridge and Waltham. We will be the town that brings people in, gets them to a certain level, and moves them on. One of the comments that was made when the teachers were here was that our retention of teachers is high. I was like, wait a second. I thought we were concerned that our retention was going to be so low that it would decrease the quality of education. That was not the comment that was made. So because of these factors, I'm against this override. And I realize that that negatively impacts teachers. And my reason for being against the override is because of the way we focus our attention on budgets for those with graduate level degrees and budgets for those without, and that we focus it on programs for our residents and not on salaries for those of undergraduate or lower education levels.

<details><summary>	 Jennifer Susse - 822</summary>

> Thank you, Karen. Jennifer? Yes. Actually, I was on the negotiating committee, the first one, when paraprofessionals said they wanted to unionize. There was universal support among the school committee for that. Of course, difficult negotiation. They felt like they had a certain amount of money. They only have so much power. Yep, yep. Negotiations finished at 1.30 on a Friday night after 12 sessions. But I think there's been a feeling for a long time that the paraprofessionals were not being paid properly. There actually have been some pretty big significant increases. What I understand is there's also been significant increases in other towns, and so relatively, you know. So you probably know that I'm going to argue in favor. Let me tell you my reasoning. So one is that I think that this has been a very thoughtful, careful process in the long-range planning. As I've said before, I was on long-range planning for four years. I've seen the quality of the discussions in that committee, and I believe sort of the conversation I've heard that there was a lot of give and take, and you know, that things got adjusted, and timelines got moved, and that the proposal now is a consensus proposal. What I understand is that the platform is unanimously and enthusiastically in support of this. There don't seem to be any doubts when I talk to sector members or listen to the committee meetings, and they are the ones, you know, that are putting this forth in this sort of political, you know, world. It's sort of, I'm safe, right? Some other things I just wanted to sort of talk about. One thing I think that may be underappreciated in town is the extent to which the state used to fund things in Arlington. I mean, in FY2002, 21% of our budget was covered by state aid, and now it's around 13%. So to the extent that we and many, many other communities that don't have a large commercial tax base have to rely on operating their bribes, it's largely because the dynamics have shifted, right? The state, after Proposition 2.5, the state said, oh, we'll cover it, and then that sort of just fell off the cliff, you know, 20 years later. As Annie mentioned, what that meant for Arlington is that there were really, really significant cuts in services, and especially at the schools that haven't, you know, as she mentioned, there have been restructuring and some things have come, new things have come on, you know, more social workers, et cetera, but some things haven't returned. So other sort of details to talk about. So just to remind, again, I sent an email a long time ago that the, in 2019, when we did the override plan, we projected in FY24 that there would be $17.6 million in deficits. We now know from the current plan, and this is not a data, I think, with the current numbers, but close, is that there's a $16.1 million surplus. So $33.7 million difference between those two numbers. 10 million dollars of that is part of that, but the other $23.7 is not. A good amount of the reason that that has happened is that we've seen increases in revenues, and a large driver of that increase in revenues has been massive increases in Chapter 7 revenue. So the Student Opportunity Act was passed, I can't remember exactly when it was passed, but it was a seven-year plan to, first it was taking an honest assessment of what it costs to educate students in the Commonwealth, and then a plan to fund that over seven years. And Arlington and lots of other districts has gotten a lot more in Chapter 7 money. So actually what you see is, yes, you've seen some significant increases in spending in Arlington, but you've seen that in lots and lots of other towns, because the state basically said, we want to fund education at a higher rate than we have before. In fact, one of the interesting things is that last year, even though the school budget went up by 5.something percent, the amount that the town contributed that wasn't Chapter 7 money was only 2.3%. And that's because of this massive increase in Chapter 7 funding. So I think we have to take into account that the Student Opportunity Act is not fully funded, we just passed the Millionaire's Tax, half of which is going to education. I suspect that we're going to see similarly generous numbers in Chapter 7 funding in the coming years. Now, we don't know that for sure, which is why I love the idea that we continue to be conservative, but we're being realistic about where we're going to be. We're not going to be at those numbers that seem very scary. Um, you think there's anything else I wanted? I think that's it.

<details><summary>	 ? - 416</summary>

> Um, yeah. I hate to put it this way, but I think this committee needs to take a macro view of what's going on. I don't want to say the schools can't have this, the schools should have this, I leave that to the school committee. But our job is to say, this is a pool of money that's going to be available to them, and this is reasonable or it's not reasonable. But the macro view of what's going on, the five-year plan is, it's the future. You don't know what's going to happen. I think we do, inherently, everything we do is conservative. We fund positions that aren't filled. We do it every year. We can make that much tighter, but then you have no free cash to be in a year. If you did that, and you went through one or two cycles, there'll be no free cash, and it'll be tight based on that. You will take that money and spend it somewhere else. The whole concept of this is, we are a conservative body. And again, I'm not looking to say, I want to punish the schools. I don't think the town's doing this. I think they need to spend more money on roads. We just take a quick look at it and say, OK, this seems reasonable based upon the history. We look at other towns, look at everything else. But we do have to take a look at the whole picture, not individually, and say, the schools aren't going to have this, and hence, we need to spend this money. Following Charlie's logic, I think is, that's a death wish for this town, because we will have deficits of $25 million, be it in 2028, 2029, or 2030. They will be there. And they will have to be filled either by annual overrides, overrides every three years. It doesn't matter. The spending is the spending regardless of when you ask for. But I don't think it's responsible to start spending money when we're really looking at these deficits way out, and we're asking on an annual basis or a tri-annual basis for money to fund it. It's just, it's one thing to maintain the services that we have. It's another thing to add to the services. I think you're just really going to see a cliff at some point, because the taxpayers will say, no, I don't have it. And then there really will be mayhem in this town.

<details><summary>	 Josh Lobel - 1013</summary>

> Other, Josh, anyone else after John? Go ahead, Josh. Last word, huh? Well, no, I didn't say that. I just want to start by saying I understand everybody's concerns that they've raised here. I'm also interested in the transparency, and I think that Charlie and Alice point that it's not really $6 million of increases. It's really $27 million. That's important to say. I don't think it's really $27 million, because I think some of those expenses were salaries, and those will definitely carry forward. But some of those expenses were curriculum. That might have been another $1 million or something like that. Some were Chromebooks. Some were furniture, things that are not really part of the operating budget, and they're not going to carry on from year to year. And I also appreciate that it's our fiduciary role to provide sound financial advice. And so I think it's entirely appropriate that we have this conversation and think about things. But what I don't get is that, and we know we have a structural deficit. We know that it's just because of the 2.5% that was set by a law maybe 40 years ago. I don't know when it was created. There's gambling going on in the casino. We know that that's the case. We've already agreed to contracts that typically have the 3, 3.5. That's why our spending goes up that much each year. So I think it's a little disingenuous to say, we're running over a cliff, or this is shocking to us, and we have to change our behavior. And it really is kind of for the course. We know we're going to have overrides at some intervals, either every year, or every three years, or whatever. As Jennifer and Annie said, generally, our overrides have really been pretty conservative on the revenue projections. And generally, the overrides have lasted one, two, three years longer than they're projected. I also think some of the comments have been like, well, how can we? We really only have an obligation to vote on this year's budget, or the next year's budget. We can't commit anything about future year's budgets. The whole breakthrough in the five-year plan and the long-range plan was, well, that was a reaction to say, well, it's stupid to, or not stupid, it's not prudent to budget year to year. We have to think about the future. We have to be planning that way. I wouldn't diminish that. I would think that the school committee has made their best guess as to what money they need to provide the kind of services they feel that the town, I mean, they keep saying that our citizens kind of expect the schools. And the quality of the schools is certainly a huge benefit to the town. Because as people think about why they might want to move here, schools are going to be a huge benefit to the town. Schools are pretty important. If we want to cut our expenses, do we want to increase the class size, cut teacher salaries? And if we don't have good retention, that has trickled down to expenses later on. Do we want to cut trash pickup every other week? Do we want to cut school services? What is it? And again, I totally appreciate the fact that it's important to exert pressure to cut. Because if you don't do that, then it really gets out of hand in a different way. So every finance organization, they always say, you know, our revenues are going. Everything is great. Everything is great. But we just wanted to cut the admin expenses by x percent or whatever. So I get that. But I think that when we look at what we're talking about, Charlie, you were really focusing on our expenses and that it's irresponsible for them to keep going up. As I said, I think where the other half of that is the revenues. I don't know what percentage we put in there for the revenue growth, but it seems like it's conservative. But then the third part of it is, as I said, the services that we're providing. And that is a really important political part of the message because although none of these votes are binding on how that money is getting spent in the long range plan, it is, again, we have to kind of, I think, embrace the idea of long range planning and embrace that we're kind of trying to raise this money, not just to kind of close that gap, but also because we want to fund the kind of town we want it to be. And if the whole campaign goes out and says, okay, we're gonna be promising these things in school, can we do that? And then we say, you know, nevermind, we're just gonna kind of make sure we don't deficit spend, then it's gonna be that much harder to get the next override passed because we've really done a pretty good historical job in meeting all of those political and financial commitments for all the overrides that I've been involved with. So for those reasons, and the final reason that Annie raised is that, you know, we're letting the vote, we're putting out to the voters, we don't get to craft that message of the campaign. Hopefully the campaign is honest and transparent and forthright. But I think given that the selectmen have voted to put this on the thing, and I guess they don't have the leverage to make a more nuanced vote unless we kind of split it up into a menu thing. But they've told, everybody has told us how they wanna spend it. And I think that it wouldn't be right if we said, okay, well, we're gonna vote for it, but we really don't hope you meet your, you know, expectations, how you wanna spend it and just save the money, hoard it, not hoard it, but you know, whatever. So I will be voting for override. Thank you, Jessica.

> Well, that was very conveniently, Josh just made most of the points that I was planning to make. So I second most of those, but just, I guess I just wanted to emphasize, I feel for me that when I look, especially at the school budget, because, you know, overwhelmingly, this override is going to the schools. Of course, there are things that I personally, if I had a line item B2, there are things that I would take out, but nobody elected me to do that. They elected the school committee and the school committee hires the superintendent. And I think they're being honest with the voters. If they say, you know, you elected these people, these are their priorities, this is the plan. And the plan is gonna cost this much. I see my role as to say, does this budget make sense given what they said their priorities are? And assuming they're going to be honest about where the money is going, especially to the collective bargaining agreements, I'm in favor of the override because I feel like the voters should have the opportunity to say, you know, yes, we've elected this select board. Yes, we've elected this school committee. This is what they're going to do. This is how much it's going to cost. Thanks.

<details><summary>	 Darrel Harmer - 480</summary>

> Thank you. Daryl. So I hope that by waiting this long, we'll be able to have a clear case about which way to go. I think both viewpoints have made very compelling, cogent points. I walked in here really expecting to vote for this. I found Al's explanation of how this impacts, or potentially impacts the future budget situation very, very convincing. On the other hand, I think the school department made a very clear case for how they use this money. And even though I don't have kids myself, I firmly believe that a strong, vibrant educational system in a town is critical for a town to be successful. To really live in towns that don't have that, eventually die. They don't go away. They just sort of almost become zombies. So I think that's really important. On the capital planning committee, one of the expense items that people really firmly believe in is a walkable town. And that takes money. So I think the town has made a case there. I frankly am terrified of trying to go to a yearly override system. I would guess that if you did a study of towns in the state that have done this, one, that's few and far between. And two, I think eventually, I think it puts us on a real slippery slope to eventually get to the point where these overrides are repairs on the town hall. I think eventually we get there. And so I really wouldn't want to go in that direction. One thing, I don't really understand the override without the school and town funding. That just seems to be, I don't know how you could spend $7 million. That's just a pot of money. And explaining to people how we got there, at least we have sort of a clear budget from what the schools gave us and what the town has given us to rationalize the 7 million. And sort of picking up on what Josh said, the structural deficit is unfortunately a bug or a feature of this town, depending on how you look at it. And there's really nothing we can do about that. So I think it's just something we have to live with. The woman who abuts us in the back, in our backyard, so two, three years ago, that if that override passed, she's on a fixed income and she'd have to move. She's still here. People keep coming to this town. So clearly we're doing something right. If the select board was so enthusiastically in support of this override, I think it's a pretty clear indication that people want the level of services that is currently being provided. And there's a cost for that. So I think I'm sort of back around to how I was when I walked in here, but I will be supporting them.

> So I'll just try to be brief here. I was really on the fence about this. Professionally, I work in municipalities. I've worked in four municipalities now, and I've never been in a municipality during the time when we've had to vote for an override. So I think this one, it's really a tough one. And I think everybody's made really good points, right? Whether you're for or whether you're against. I think certainly the level of services, especially for the schools are what I think and what I've come to learn that people in this town expect. They want a high level of service. They want to be the town manager 12. Those are some of the premier communities in Massachusetts that I think that we want to be like. But given the numbers, and when you look at our property values and you look at the constraints that we are in for our budgets, we end up coming to the conclusion like we have that revenues don't end up keeping up with our expenses. So we end up having to do these overrides periodically or concentrated within the last few years. I hope we never end up looking like Nantucket. I did a quick look at Nantucket. They've done probably three or four dozen overrides mostly in the nineties. And I think that that looks like a complete disaster. So please let's not go the way of Nantucket. You can look up the history too if you go to the division of local services for prop two and a half overrides. I'd recommend everybody does and just poke around. But I think getting back to the original point of whether you support it, whether you don't, I think you really could make, and again, not to be neutral on this. I think I came in here thinking more voting against, for I think many of the reasons Alcosky that you made is good financial management. You wouldn't want to put yourself, you wouldn't want to be intentionally putting yourselves in a deficit. But I also, again, from learning about the community and understanding what the needs of our residents are, and especially the needs of the residents in the precinct that I live in, precinct one where I think many of the services that are being proposed, especially for the school would benefit from. I see that there's a very compelling reason for voting for the additional funding is for a lot of these initiatives. So, it's tough for me to say yes, but I think I'm going to be voting in favor for it.

<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 744</summary>

> Well, thanks everyone. This has been really informative and educational. I appreciate all your viewpoints and really what it means why I like finance committee. I guess, so I'm going to vote yes. I was just looking at the presentation from the superintendent of the school committee and so much of what the town provides is to its people. And I think a lot of this budget is going to be focused on people. We're not talking about only paying the teachers, but we're talking about professional development, pathways to licensure. For so many of the staff in the schools, we expect them to have a bachelor's degree, master's degree and be licensed. And if we're going to recruit and retain good people, we need to sort of, our budget needs to reflect that and to sort of compete. And I know we're not going to compete with everybody, but I feel like the superintendent of the school committee has spent a lot of time. And I hear Al Pasti and Charlie and others like pulling this back to understand that this is the budget numbers or something we'll have to confront. But I think a budget is also a value statement. The town provides services, services that so many of the taxpayers consume and value. And that's why I'm going to vote yes. I appreciate it. Anyone else we haven't heard from? All right. I know a couple of other people have their hand up for a second time, but before I do, I want to put this out there. And it's following up on what Josh and Daryl said. The select board, the elected officials for our town have put an override on the ballot. And they have said, this is what the money is going to go for. There's going to be a campaign asking the voters to pony up $7 million for these things. And I can't imagine an override in Arlington that does not make promises, or anywhere. If you were to ask me, if I were on the finance committee, and nothing, you would ask me, will you vote for a $7 million over? I would say, well, what for? Where is it going to go? And if it's just to shore up against a future deficit, I'd say, well, why $7 million? Why not $1 million? Why now? Why not $3 million? So I think just practically speaking, there has to be a reason to put before the voters to vote for it. Now, once that happens, once the select board says, this is what it's going to go for, and the voters approve it, do we as the finance committee say, we're going to ignore that? We're not, next year's town meeting, we're going to say, we really don't care what this select board said. We don't care what the campaign was. We're going to tell the town meeting not to give the $3 million or $1.3 million to the school of finance here. Aren't we immediately? putting ourselves in an adversarial position with the school committee, for which we will pay the price as a town, I think, going down the road in the future. And I could be wrong. I'm just putting that out there because I would like people to think about that and say, well, no, we don't have to. That won't be the situation. We don't deal with that. What do we do on the floor of town meeting when we say, no, we don't recommend that schools get that money? I know exactly what's going to happen. The school committee will have their amended motion to amend the budget and say to town meeting, the vote is voted for. And then we'll get the battle on town meeting four. Do we want to put ourselves in that position when we say, OK, tonight we will vote for a $7 million override. But we are not going to be found by the school committee. I don't know what the response to that is. It is just my concern about how we would handle this if we were to take a vote other than yes, we support, or no, we don't. Yes, we support the override as the select board has put on the ballot with their committee. So I'm just putting that out. And I know that John and Charlie had their hands up. So I'll go to John and Charlie.

> Yeah. So as far as what you explained to the voters, where is this money going to go? I would just say it's going to the school operating budget is going to increase by $17 million over the next five years. That money has to come from somewhere. And that's where the override is going to go. That's where the override is going to go to fund that $17 million increase. The town committee, town meeting already approved. This is the official long-range plan. That increase has been presented there. That's where the money is going to go. So I mean, to me, how can you have an override without additional spending? To me, that makes, I have a hard time accepting that question. Because it seems like, let's just say, maybe this oversimplifies it, but let's just say you run up a credit card debt throughout the year. And you say, all right, well, I'm going to get a big bonus at the end of my year. So it doesn't matter that I run up a credit card debt. And then when you get the bonus, you say, all right, great. Now I'm going to Europe. Or I'm going to spend that bonus on something else. It's like, OK, now what about the credit card debt that you ran up? The override is going to go to this additional spending that we currently can't afford. So to say that we're going to have an override and then take on new spending, I don't understand that. And then one final thing, sorry for taking too much time. If it's a straight up yes or no, without any message to kind of at least disagree with the spending, then I would probably not open the override. Because I hate the idea of that $105 million jumping to $112 million. And then everybody's saying, Selectman approved it. You approved it. It's $112 million. I can't support that. So that's. Well, I have a point of order question. Point of order might be the wrong question. I need to understand how this is happening. So this is a good opportunity to point out that the question I asked is going to come up soon. It's going to come up this fall. Because the FY 24 budget will have to be amended this fall to add that $1 million into the budget. So we're going to have an override election. When? In November 7. November 7. OK, so there's an override before town meeting discusses this. Yes. I'm not sure of the timing, whether there's going to be a town meeting that meets in both contingent on an override passing or the other way. Yes, contingent. But in any event, this fall, we will be presented with an amended budget. We're going to have to deal with that. So right off the bat is that concern that we might be in this battle. Another point of order. So I'll switch. Charlie? Oh, wait, he has another point of order. I have a question. We'll be presented with an amended budget, which way? Saying if the override passes, this is the budget. Or if the override fails, this is the budget. Right, so I don't know what the timing is going to be, whether there's going to be town meeting. That will vote a contingent budget. Or there's going to be an override and then a town meeting. But let's just say there's the override and then town meeting. So the town manager is going to present to the finance committee a proposed budget that's going to have this first year. That will be the effect of the vote. If it's the other way around, we're going to have town meeting presented with two budgets. One, if the override passes. And the existing one, if it doesn't. Which we did in 2012, I believe. Presented two budgets. Well, the budget's already passed. We'll just have to deal with this new one. It depends on the timing, whether the town meeting's before the override.

<details><summary>	 Charles Foskett - 350</summary>

> So Charlie, I'd hand up, and then Annie, and then Jeff. Thank you, Madam Chair. Just two points. First is that, with respect to Josh's comments, there's nothing disingenuous about my suggesting that we have override votes every year. I'm basically trying to get the decision-making put into the hands of the voters, basically on a real-time basis. Secondly, I think the dichotomy that you just presented, the possibility that if we vote in favor of the override, that we can't vote against specific expenses in the future, means that voting in favor of this override advocates our ability to do it and make informed decisions about future spending. And I think that that's a real problem. And let me ask you this. How would this be different than the past override, where the select board made similar commitments, including keeping to town operating budget increases that we need in a quarter, and needs school at 3 and 1 1, and sped at 7. And we, as a finance committee, made sure that was our job to make we made sure that the budgets that we presented at town meeting fell within that. How is this different than the 2019 override? It's not, other than the fact that we're facing larger deficits. And we're going down a path that's worse than we were in the past. And there's nothing wrong with saying that, despite what we've done in the past, it's not the correct path to go in the future. That's my position. I just want to clarify that. This isn't that we're going to be doing something. If we were to do this, it's not new. It's a question of, now we have these much larger deficits that will continue to grow. That is why the decision now may be different than what was My point is that our expense levels are too high, And I have been on the other side. I co-chaired the override. I co-chaired against it. So I'm not afraid of spending money. But I think we have to be rational about where we're headed.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 54</summary>

> Well, my first question is, are you ready for a motion? If you're not ready for a motion, then I've got one more thing to say. Well, you can have your say. And Jennifer has something to say, or a question, or something. And then I'm going to open it up to anybody else.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jennifer Susse - 994</summary>

> So the commitments that the select board is making are assuming somewhat of a certain state in the world. And we have, in the past, modified those commitments because things happened. In 2005, we voted an override. And we said that we would be back in five years. And we weren't. And we made deep cuts in services because the economy had crashed. And we had people losing their houses in town. And we didn't think we could morally afford to raise property taxes. I am the caricature of a tax and spend liberal. And I wouldn't have voted for an override that year. And it wasn't because I couldn't afford it. It's because I was seeing an economy crashing all around my shoulders. So we are not hampered by the select board's commitments or any other political statement from doing what is fiscally responsible in a crisis. So that's how that works, John. We can recommend a budget that doesn't follow this plan if this plan is no longer connected to reality. But this five-year plan is not approved by the company. It's not? No, it's not approved by anybody. That five-year plan is a projection that's made by the town manager that's used to guide the finance committee, the select board, the school committee, and the town's administrators in their future thinking. It's a way of saying to them, that's the thing that you want to do this year. It has this implication five years down the road. All town meeting votes every year is that year's budget. So they haven't committed to any of this. They commit to a budget every year. It leaves that plan, as Josh said, to control our forward-looking future. It's saying, here's what we think the future is going to look like. And we have, for almost 20 years, done it that way. And in many of those years, we've used it to say, this is what it's going to take to preserve the services that we have. This year, we're saying, this is what it's going to take to preserve services that we have and provide the services the community is now demanding. And the voters are going to say, yep, we're ready for that or not. So that's how that works. I don't know. I'm ready to vote, but. I don't have a comment. It's a very small point. So one is, I do understand that the town meeting will be in mid-October. And that's because of the timing of the MBTA communities and the fossil fuel demonstration pilot timing needs. So that is a contingent vote, as I understand. So I just want to say, I do understand the worry about these numbers. The two overrides I worked on, 2011 to 2019, we made additions. We didn't just fund bare minimum. Those additions weren't as big as this. So I get this. I think that these are important decisions to make. I believe the school committee that they are seeing a change in retention rates. And I think the point about retention was about younger teachers who aren't retiring. But at some point, teachers are willing to accept lower if they feel they have a good supportive school district, which we do. But if it gets too low, it's irresponsible to your family. So we don't want our school system to have numbers that people feel are irresponsible to their family to keep that job. And so that's part of it. But that's it. I don't know, Jones. Just a couple of responses about more frequent smaller overrides. Again, other towns do do it. It becomes almost habitual and sort of works. And I know people in Nantucket, they sort of love them. But again, I think the more important point is that if you have override votes, which if they fail, that means something that a group of people want doesn't happen. As opposed to if it fails, the town's economy collapses. It allows people to be more reasonable about whether they vote yes or no because they know that a no vote isn't going to cause a collapse or layoffs, make massive layoffs. It's only going to do a small thing, which More frequent smaller ones give us more of a democratic position there. And also, to Carolyn's point about teacher salaries, there are two parts of that equation, as we all know. And I think a lot of us have had questions about the headcount growth in the schools. You get more people pay them less, or fewer people pay them more. And that's a choice that the school committee has to make every year. But the thing that really bothers me is sort of the seventh generation thing. If you look at any of the charts and graphs over a period of time, you have income growing at a rate, town revenues growing at a rate with overrides. And you have town expenses growing at a faster rate. So you have a continuing deficit or a structural deficit. That's the difference. And it continues to grow without any effort, without any seeming effort to change those curves. And I don't think we can make the assumption that the town has an infinite capacity to vote increases which are growing faster than incomes, faster than the general economy. I don't know why that's happening. But just from that broad sense, just look at the graphs. How long can that be sustained? And without the crude statement that I've told Charlie from a boss of mine, the longer it takes to recognize and correct a bad trend, the worse it gets. And I think it's irresponsible for me to vote towards something that's going in a really bad direction without any attempt to change that curve a little bit. I just can't do that in good conscience. I'll pass to you. I've said my piece. But I just urge the committee.

<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 78</summary>

> There's been a lot of discussion. It's been a good discussion. There's a lot of things, yearly overrides. I'd urge the committee to keep it simple. The selectmen have made a vote. And we should either support it or not support it and not do a whole bunch of amendments. I mean, we need to keep our decision-making process clean. And we'll worry about the fall town meeting in two years from now, two years from now. Sorry.

<details><summary>	 ? - 105</summary>

> Just to add to that, the override is, as you said, it's a set number. Nowhere on the override is it saying what it's for. We have the ability, the town has the ability to do that if they want. But this is just a general override. So as far as that is concerned, the spending, I don't think we're in a position to say, we're not going to spend it on the schools. We're not going to do this. I mean, I think our position is going to be quite clear. But I don't think, at this point, we need to even address that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 16</summary>

> All right. A couple more questions now. And, Tana, our comments are all in the motion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 429</summary>

> Thank you, Madam Chair. I just have a quick question. Thank you. This has been incredibly helpful and insightful to hear your inputs. Was the select board decision unanimous? Yes. There was one select board member who wasn't present, but I know that he would have voted for it. Thanks. Carolyn Topper. So I know it sounds like I'm talking in micro terms when I address the TAs. But I'm really talking more macro about the fact that part of the reason our expenses keep going up is because we're switching from undergrad to graduate level staff across the board. And we're paying them at very relevant amounts. And in the process, we also want to increase programs, which we're spending. And in the process, we're cutting out the lowest group of people. It is a more macro way of looking at it. It just happens to be one group of staff. And it's one way to deal with the deficit issue. It won't take care of the entire deficit, but it's another way of looking at how we spend our money and why we spend it where we do. OK. Yeah, just a point on the yearly override, not to get to that. But another way to avoid it. Let's call it more frequent. OK. But another way to avoid the go-off-the-cliff side of it, to some degree, is you're doing this year. As you're passing it before, absolutely, you have to have two budgets that fiscal year. And then if it fails, you don't have time to react. So just a follow-up. Real quick point. I know I've already spoken a couple of times. On Monday night, the town council was very clear that they had to have three votes. He stood up and said, this is what you need to do. A, are you going to have the override? Yes or no. B, are you going to approve the spending, which that's a separate issue. And then three, the date. So it's clear we don't have any opinion on the date. That's out of our realm. But it was definitely two specific questions. And they had separate votes on each of them. So I would think it would be appropriate for us to have two separate votes. That's my final comment. Thank you very much. Anyone else has anything to say? We're all open. Annie. So I move that we support the selectors' vote as recorded by the selector, including all of their commitments, and the dollar amount of $7 million. Second. Second. Any discussion? Charlie.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Charles Foskett - 15</summary>

> I would amendment that we split the question between the override and the additional spending.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 385</summary>

> Second. That motion's been made and seconded. Any other discussion? Comments? All right. So we will take Charlie's motion first. So Charlie's motion is first to vote to support a $7 million budget. $1 million override, and the second is to vote to dispense. So what we're voting on is the decision is to decide to split, correct? I move that we split the vote. I didn't move that vote. In other words, Annie made a motion for a single vote. Right. And you are moving that we have two votes. Right. All right. So we will take that first. Does everyone understand what we're doing? I'm sorry. Are you being hacked in layman's terms? What we are voting now is whether we will take two votes. What will the two votes? If we decide, if we vote to take two votes, the first vote will be to support an override, and the second vote to support dispense associated with the override. If Charlie's motion fails, then we will just take one vote, and his motion is up or down. I'm curious. Would that be the wrong word? Because if people are, not the single or double, but if there's two votes, should we vote the additional spending first? Because otherwise, you're voting for the $7 million. Right now, we're voting whether to split. We can just, we can, the question is, do we vote in? Split it. That's what I'm following. So any other questions? All right. All those who want to split the vote into two, raise your hand. 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Can you keep your hands up for just a second? 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. I changed my vote. OK. OK. So how many do you have there?  8, 8 for splitting. Yeah, no, I only have 7, so I missed someone. OK, raise your hand again if you want to split. Josh? Oh, Josh. OK. 8. OK, 8 for splitting. Those who do not want to split the vote, raise your hand. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Keep them high. They only type so fast. Thank you. All right, so we will have one vote, up or down. Andy's vote. So Andy's motion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 229</summary>

> So the motion before the Arlington Finance Committee is, do we support the select board's vote to put a $7 million override onto the ballot in November with the commitments that they have made? Does everyone understand what we are voting on? Any questions? All right, all those in favor of the override, raise your hand. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Can you keep them up? Caroline, you can make up your mind. I wanted to make a point. I think we really need to be looking at. OK. Let's see what she does when the no vote comes up. Yeah. You have 10? I have 10. All right, those who oppose the override, raise your hand. 7. Hold on. Wait. I missed someone. Charlie, Dave, Al Jones, Brian. Oh, Brian. OK. Grant, John, and Al. OK. Madam Chairman, you almost came close to having a vote. I know. All right, so the Finance Committee supports the override decision by the select board by a vote of 10 to 7. I want to thank everyone for the caliber of discussion. I think this is a service to the voters, whether if they listen to our discussion tonight, I think they will be well-educated. However they may decide, I think they will be helped by our very thoughtful, respectful conversation. So I greatly appreciate that.

<details><summary>Election of Officers</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 183</summary>

> Last order of business is housekeeping, election of officers. OK, so we have four positions open, one for chair and three for vice chairs. Our current officers are Christine Deschler as chair, and our vice chairs are Daryl Harmer, Alan Jones, and Amy LaCourte. So nominations have been solicited in advance by email. Nominees can also be accepted right now during the meeting. So you can either share your nominations to me directly, or you can share them in front of everyone during this meeting. And then after the nomination's closed, we're going to have the nominees have the chance to remove themselves if they wish to not stand for election or re-election. Voting will be by private paper ballots. And so now I would like to ask, oh, so first I'll just list the candidates that we have received so far is the same slate of folks who are already in the position. So Christine Deschler for chair, and then Daryl Harmer for vice chair, Alan Jones for vice chair, and Amy LaCourte for vice chair. Do we have any other nominations?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 124</summary>

> Yes. I emailed you some. When did you do that? Earlier today. To my personal email? Count email? Hold on. But I might as well just say them since I'm here. That's true, yes. Yes, the two different nominees that you hadn't mentioned are Al Toastie and Charlie Fosker for vice chair. I declined. I'm sure you would have. You've never done that. I know. Charlie? I declined. OK. So that's why I emailed. I don't see the email through. Yeah, I don't see it. Oh, well, no worries. Yeah. OK. It's because he's having an event. Yes, Brian?  Since we have, if there's no other nominations, and the people are in, can we just? Nominate Dean. He's not even here. I declined.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 99</summary>

> OK, I'll just move by acclamation here, a unanimous acclamation. Does someone want to make a motion? OK, Brian just did. I seconded. Let's move on to Dean. OK. OK, so all those in favor of the slate of candidates, which would be Christine Deschler for chair, Daryl Harmer for vice chair, Alan Jones for vice chair, and Annie LaCour for vice chair, please raise your hands. And it's unanimous, perfect, easy. And to think that I made these today. That's wise. I'll save them for next year. You're working really hard. Thank you, thank you, thank you, everyone.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Adjourn</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Various - 253</summary>

> I am doing this really hard. You've got to make it. This is a really great program. That's right. All right, so the next event is Wednesday, the 21st, at Charles Hallow's. We'll have that big party. Can't wait. And then we have back to the porch. Then we have one last meeting, which I assume is going to be very brief, and it'll be via Zoom for transfers. And that's the 26th. Wednesday, Monday, the 26th. And then we will be done until October. Does anyone have anything to maybe want to talk about, raise, discuss? In terms of the override in our political role, could you just review that? The finance committee officially supports the override. Individuals, making it clear that they are representing themselves in a finance committee, can campaign or not for whatever side, or no side at all. They can. Yes. Yes. Because it's an issue. It's not a person. So it's not like events have become beholden to somebody you don't like to do this for. But it should be made clear to everyone that your views are your own. Yeah. I mean, I feel like even in support of the override, I would represent my views as my own because of the various discussions we had. And go out there and say, this is how the whole finance committee feels, or even the people who voted against it. Anything else? All right. Move to adjourn? Move to adjourn. All in favor? Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye.
