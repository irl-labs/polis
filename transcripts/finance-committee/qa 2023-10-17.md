<details><summary>Please, summarize the Finance Committee meeting.</summary>

> The Finance Committee meeting discussed the town's financial situation and the impact of a potential override. The committee clarified that the $400,000 appropriation for the schools would not be appropriated due to the language on the ballot and would be considered in a future town meeting. The committee also discussed the town's strong financial position, with a record free cash number of over $1 million. The committee also discussed the town's budget projections for the next few years, with a potential $17 million deficit in FY27 if the override does not pass. The committee also discussed the process for funding the schools, with the select board making commitments for certain programs as part of the override. The meeting ended with the committee voting to reconsider and take no action on Article 2.

> The discussion revolved around the reconsideration of a vote for a $400,000 appropriation for the schools. The original vote was for the fiscal year 2025, but the language on the ballot indicated that it would not take effect until fiscal year 2025. The select board had made a series of commitments to fund certain programs as part of the override, which were baked into the budget projections. However, due to the language on the ballot, the $400,000 appropriation for the schools would not be raised until fiscal year 2025. The select board approved the additional funding, but it was clarified that the school committee usually develops the budget. The select board sponsors a ballot question like this. The group decided to push for a "no action" on this ballot, with the understanding that the override money the schools were anticipating would be funded via some other avenue at the spring town meeting.
