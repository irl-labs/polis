<details><summary>Reconsideration of Special Town Meeting Warrant Article 2</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 178</summary>

> Okay. Moving on to. Agenda item. Number three, reconsideration of the town meeting or an article. Art number two. Because of the language on the ballot. The $400,000 appropriation that we were expecting to put into the schools, the FYI. I'm going to turn it over to you for a brief explanation. Sure. As to why we need to reconsider and revote. Great. Had we taken the vote as it was sort of. Presented the town meeting. It would have been Nolan Boyd. Anyways, the, the ballot as written. Was written as such. It would not take effect until fiscal year 25. When all along the anticipated plan was for this to happen. We are going to need to push for a. No action on this ballot. And with the understanding of the. Override money, the schools were anticipating and were previously supported to be funded via some other Avenue at the spring town meeting. That is the brief explanation. I'm going to turn it over to you for a brief explanation of why we need to revote.

> The $400,000 appropriation. We've been trying to focus in the last, probably about a week and a half or two weeks. That has really. Made the, our position. It's not really going to have a detrimental impact on our financial position through the end of this. We're going to have a deficit of about $17,000,027. Without the benefit of this override money. We're projecting a. The deficit of around. 17,000,027 with a smaller deficit in 26 in front of it. That's sort of the brief. That's the brief.

<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 47</summary>

> Okay. Anyone have any questionsas to what we need to do tonight? I'm sorry. If we can deal with whatwe have to do. Tonight, then we can have continued the conversation asto anything. About what we might do. Next. Any questionson. Reconsidering. The consideration of article two.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Alex? - 264</summary>

> I have a question. Christine. Thank you, Alex. Can you just explain that to me one more time? So the vote that the select board took was for FYI. 25. And where does it say that? Cause I'm just looking at article two right now, which says FYI 24. So. I'm looking in the right place. You're looking in the wrong place. The vote. On the ballot language that is going to go to the vote. In November at the special election. So that was for FYI 25. Language. That is correct. Okay. And so that was for FYI 25. Great. Okay. Thank you. Any other questions by anyone. I have a motion to reconsider and for a new action bill. Salute. Okay. All right. All right. I will go through the roll call. All right. All in favor of the motion, please raise your hand. Any opposed. It is unanimous. All right. I will go through the. The roll call now. Jordan. Yes. Shane. Yes. Jennifer. Yes. Sophie. Yes. Brian's not here. Carolyn. Yes. Rebecca. Yes. Josh. Yes. John. Yes. Daryl. Yes. Annie. Yes. Yes. Peggy. Yes. Al. Yes. Did I miss you? All right. Jones. All right. Yes. Right. What I, I should have. Okay. I just left the room to give the, okay for the supplemental income report to be distributed, which we have here. That's. Pretty basic. We considered. No action. All right now with that done. What questions do people have for. About. Okay. What's going on, what we can do with the projections are all the above. Any.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 161</summary>

> Okay. So if I understand correctly, what this means is that we are collecting less money. In this override, because we are not raising taxes in 2024. We're raising them in 2025. Correct. And therefore you're thinking. Okay. So it depends if the override does pass. We will not have a, we're not projecting a deficit in 2026. Okay. If the override does pass. So say it takes effect in FYI 25. Anticipate if it passes. We'll be facing a $15 million deficit in FYI 27. Okay. Right. So we're pretty clear through 26. Okay. So the projections were presented to the long range planning committee, sort of how they narrowed in on a three year. Override for $7 million, which is roughly 5% of the levy. The projections showed just under $17 million being our 27 FYI 27 deficit in that year. So. The conditions on the ground. Have. Have become a little better. Okay. In that sense. All right.

<details><summary>	 ? - 237</summary>

> This is for a number of different reasons, which we are sure we'll get into another. So in terms of the schools. The money that they had requested for their strategic plan doesn't change except for the $400,000. Right. So that doesn't change. It's not being appropriated to me because of the language on the screen, but it's not being appropriated to me because of the language on the screen. And so that will be considered in the future. Future town meeting. Whether that's spring and what funding source that is. All of her. For FYI. Correct. Okay. FYI 25. 7 million kicks in. Exactly. Right. And so that, that included. $3.1 million. And funding additional funding for 25. $3.1 million. $3.1 million. 600. For 20. Seven. 300 for 28. Sure. Sure. I just want to confirm Alex. To confirm the schools can't spend the 400. Because they don't have. Right. Right. So they're not, their budget is not being increased by $400,000. Right. I just want to clarify. Okay. So we're looking at a budget balance. Let's go 25. We're okay. Right. Let's go 26. We're okay. If the override passes. 26 is okay for the L override does not pass in 26. We're looking at a small deficit. Which candidly will. I would imagine because of our conservative forecasting, it's built into this model that that deficit will close itself as well. Okay. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 89</summary>

> Madam chair. Yes. So the deficit. Reduced deficit in fiscal 26, which you said is small. And it may be correct. Does that include the increased spending for the school department? If the override doesn't pass, it does not include that. Okay. Right. So that, that, that's contingent funding. So that wouldn't include any. If the override doesn't pass all of the. Okay. And then we're looking at how to balance the budget. In different ways. You know what? How the school budget is doing. Right now versus plan.

<details><summary>	 ? - 372</summary>

> I don't we're still early in the year. They're carrying a number of vacancies right now. So they're likely underspending to, to their year to date. We're just over a quarter of the way through the fiscal year. They're likely. To be generating more free cash. Because of the vacancies they're carrying. What about the town? We are also in a similar position. Understanding. So the ripple effect of that is to likely be generating more free cash. This is one of the. Major reasons why we're in the strong sort of financial position we're in. We just last week certified a record free cash number a little over $1,000,000. So we're in a position to be generating more free cash than we would normally be. And half of that. Will be turned into a funding source for future fiscal years. It also. Marginally dragged up our trailing 10 year average, which is projected into the five-year long range plan. So does that make sense? So. The chair. So. Where did the 18 million. I mean, normally we're 11 to 13 million or something like that. So. The biggest. The biggest sources were. Were. We had a major, we had a huge outperformance on our interest bearing accounts. The main being our investment interest. We are carrying a ton of cash because of the high school building project. Interest rates have gone. Up. So we have a huge amount of interest. Revenues. We have budgeted for $200,000 and FYI 23. And we may just shy of $3 million. So that that's about a 2.8 million dollar nugget that was in there. Which is unanticipated. And frankly, it's probably temporary. Given the interest rates that we're seeing right now. It's very difficult to hire people right now. The labor market's impossible. So any of those vacancies that were budgeted that we're trying to hire for. Couldn't that money closes to free cash as well. Additionally. We had a couple other local receipts come in higher than anticipated. That is sort of part of a hallmark of our conservative local receipts budgeting. We budget conservatively knowing that we will likely beat our revenue targets. And that's built into sort of our plan. So what.

> If I may have. So on the, on the, the interest income. Doesn't the federal government prohibit arbitrage. Like that on the part of municipalities.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 315</summary>

> I don't know that it does. I don't have a good answer for you. I recall. Multiple years ago. I don't know. I don't recall that the town. Money back or something like that. When. It was discovered that we were. In the, in the money market game. Yeah, my understanding on the arbitrage is that it will arbitrage will kick in. If we have borrowed for a specific purpose and we do not spend for that purpose. And so that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's part of our. Normal sort of cashflow projections at the beginning of the project. And, you know, it's a $250 million project. So we carry cash flows to get us through to our next anticipated borrowing, which we do annually. And we have another scheduled borrowing in February, which will be having a ratings call coming up very soon. So. We're not over borrowing to invest the money or anything like that. But it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money to pay for it. In a sense, it's a blessing in disguise, but. It's a good. Good. Obviously it's good. Yeah. Are we going to see the reverse happen when you do your next borrowing? Are we going to be paying higher interest rates? Yeah, we'll borrow at a slightly higher interest rate than we had in the past. But, you know, we anticipate a very strong bond rating. We anticipate a very strong bond rating. And we anticipate a very strong bond rate. That we feasibly could have access to. We won't borrow. On the project. How. How's our new growth running compared to budget. New growth came in. About 17% over our budgeted number last year. So we anticipated a million dollars. Just. We anticipated a million dollars. And our current date number is $177,000 over that one. Okay. Okay. Any other questions.

> Yeah. Regarding the override. You know, as I understand it, it was, I think it's referred to as a single question. All right. I've said, you know, will the town. Will the voters approve. Okay. So I was just maybe just looking for a little bit of clarification on, on these appropriations to the school committee. I mean, to the school's budget. Like where do they exist? Are they official or will they not be official? When did they become official? When like. Cause I hear you talk about, you know, $17 million budget deficits a couple of years from now. You know, should those be reconsidered or are they already locked in?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 251</summary>

> Yeah, I mean, I think it's really important to understand that the selection board makes an anticipation of pursuing the override. And so the select board makes a series of commitments where they're going to fund these certain programs with this much money. They'll see them in these different years. As part of the override. And so that is where those get baked into sort of our projections and our budget. Okay. So the select committee. Approved. The additional funding. But is that the proper procedure? I'm just, you know, Like generally, is that how it goes?  The select one. Funding for the schools generally. Well, generally the school committee develops the budget, but. The select board. It needs to be. Who sponsors a ballot question like this. So, so. The select committee. Approves this, the $7 million override, you know, and I know that's very official. It says, you know, we approve the voters to come and vote on whether or not, you know, they're going to pay an additional $7 million of taxes. So that's perfectly crystal clear in my head. The funding for the school, you know, I'm still learning. I'm still trying to figure it out. So, right. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Traditionally. Before the. This is how, this is the money we're going to raise. This is how it's going to be spent. So traditional. The money has to be appropriated in a normal way. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 ? - 190</summary>

> Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. The department of revenue has taken the position that the first year you're bound by what you have told the people. Year two and on. You do what you wish, but you're at least bound. You know, if, if the override. Says we're going to spend X for schools and Y for town. And the first year you're legally bound by that. Yep. Thank you. Thanks so much. Okay. So I wonder, maybe I'm on. You know, I'm still somewhat new here. Is because I do see that there are such things as contingent overrides. And there's also things where like you can have an override for specific fire truck. Right. And you say, you know, will the voters pay for this fire truck? I don't think that this was a contingent override and I don't think this was an override where we. Are paying for like a fire truck, right? This is an operating override. So I'm just wondering if you could give me a little bit of a sense of what that looks like. And how that is spent.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 294</summary>

> Commitments have been made. At various boards. Yeah. Like the select board being the main one to fund it in a certain specific way. So like Al said, In out years, I mean, who knows what's going to happen? Like we could get hit by a comment and then like things are going to change, but that is the plan for this money. The plan. Okay. I'm just trying to follow the, you know, the. Okay. Quick point of word to confirm that I missed something. The. Hand vote was to reconsider and the roll call was to confirm. The hand vote. Was to reconsider and move the note. No action on our tip. Okay. I just want to make sure. Involving both, okay, consider and I just want to make sure we're good. Just as long as we have you here, what's the difference in how much we got in chapter 70 money from what we're projecting. I don't know. I don't think that it was much different in 23, and I don't anticipate, I mean, those, the state budgets, but once they have a fully baked number, like, that's basically what you get. Right? Right. Okay. What percentage were we giving towards schools versus the town budget. So, out of that, so, so I can give you a number as a ratio. So, 600,000 dollars was out of the total of the override was for the town and the schools were all the other different and the, the, the town money is programming to F. Y. 25. And we are right now we are in, we're in F. Y. 24. okay. All right, we will have to wrap it up so that we can be at start. Tell me, does anyone have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 180</summary>

> One quickly, what are the other 2 areas that you said you're increasing the revenue. Okay, so. Are we finished with both? Yes. Great. Um, investments vacancies. Oh, we also had so the reserve fund that you guys manage, we had a very light winter last year that we all went through. So, nearly all of that money closed the free cash as well. That money traditionally has been spent to cover winter deficits also school enrollment for F. Y. 25 has projected to decrease to increase at a slower pace than it had been previously. We had carried 42 additional students in F. Y. 25 and that number is likely to be somewhere between 0 and 10 there. So, in the plan, we're carrying 10 as sort of a, a likely worst case scenario at this point, but that moved the needle to the tune of about 300 K. So, that's a decrease in new growth to the school budget. Right. Right. So, so what and that that ripples through 4 years. So that's a meaningful impact. Thank you.

<details><summary>Adjourn</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Christine Deshler - 129</summary>

> Um, I think we'll hold off until a future meeting. We won't be meeting on Thursday and I don't anticipate meeting to meet again, but we'll keep it posted. Okay. Can I mention something on that? Yeah, I don't want to jinx things. We likely won't be there, but there is a small glimmer of hope that we can consider the ring. We've had some surprise movement in that negotiation. We'll keep our fingers crossed. Getting this out of the way would be nice, I think, but just just throwing that out on your radar. So that would be a reason that we would meet again. So it's still but it's All right, so moved, seconded. All in favor of adjourning? Aye. Aye. Thank you for an efficient meeting.
