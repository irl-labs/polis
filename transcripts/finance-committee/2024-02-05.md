<summary>1. Review and approve minutes.</summary>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the minutes of the last meeting? I cannot do that yet because I'm still downloading the new version of Zoom, so I can't share unless unless people don't need it up on the screen. Do people need the minutes on the screen? No. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So, have everyone had the opportunity to look at the minutes of the last meeting? Anyone have any corrections, revisions that they seek? Do I have a motion to approve? Second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed? No. It's been approved. Since we met, we've had a flurry of emails and other information that has been disseminated. I just want to make sure everyone has seen everything. Starting with, first of all, the contact list. Has everyone gotten the contact list? No. And if anyone has any corrections to the contact list, please let Tara know. All right, so we have Rebecca, thank you for getting Joe Conley's responses. Jim Feeney updated us on the body camera program. Has everyone had that? Cybersecurity, and so you got a grant for that. And then the field use policy. Has everyone had that? And I think what we have, and there was a confirmation that we pay, make a payment in lieu of taxes for Great Meadows. I think that is it. I think that is the totality of what we've received since the last meeting. If anyone, does anyone have any questions about anything on those topics, having read what has been sent to us? As a principle, it is maintaining comedy with the town of Lexington to pay them for the municipal services that we receive on Great Meadows. What's that? We pay Lexington just to keep things nice and happy. All right. All right. On to Grant.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Grant? - 94</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, if you want to know the history of that, I believe it was a long, long ago when they tried to make it a drinking water facility. And so they wanted to preserve and own the rights to the watershed. And that was that. That's why we do that. I don't think they were using newness, but they might have. I mean, it's taxes on the property, and so they send a whole lot of kids from there to the schools. That's the history behind it. That's not how the tax system works.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so. So can I just, this is a question back on the enterprise fund and the answer we received regarding insurance for those. I'm just wondering the way the enterprise fund is, should there be a sort of a program or some sort of payment back? Sort of like an offset almost or not for program that's insurance. I'm not sure who I was on this email, but I'm not here to address it. But I saw an email from Carolyn that said that when they talk about insurance, they're going to try to sort out at least how much would be attributable to kid care. And especially if kid care expands in size, how much of an expansion they would expand. I'm not sure now, in retrospect, whether everyone got that email. OK, I don't remember seeing that Carolyn. So I guess then for any accountants or does it would it make sense to show that cost on the enterprise fund if we view the enterprise fund as sort of a standalone thing? Just a question. I don't think it would make sense. I think the question is asking the finance department to make that happen. So we ought to add that to the list of things we need to talk to the finance department about, like we can get to bugging them about COAs or rolling it back to the budget and taking our enterprise fund last time. And you can file a list of questions. I don't think we're going to do that. I will try to do that. Carolyn will help me. Yes, thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>2. Review Budgets.</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 18</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So we have police, fire and sexual services. All right, Daryl, John, take it from here.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer and John Griffin - 627</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start with police, which is on page 116 of the budget. Most of us with computers, if you want to look at it, it is on SharePoint under fiscal 25 budget program and public safety. On the salary side, to be honest, on the entire budget side, there's not a whole lot going on. Interesting issues with police vacancies, of course, but, you know, cameras on the salary side. The only changes are the 5100 account. This is a very step increase and so on. And a little reduction in longevity. Alan, if you have tried to tie the salary detail to the summary page, it's up by $125. The salaries page misses part of the longevity for the chief. So the summary page is correct. Okay. And Topher, you had some questions on the overtime, the 51 on the free line item. The overtime is driven by primarily the various staffing requirements on the shift level. The two shifts between midnight and 4 p.m. require that there be four officers on the shift. So the 4 p.m. to midnight needs seven because Arlington is such a rollicking town at night. And then there have to be two ranking officers per shift. Vacancies, vacation, sick. They can't get up to those compliments when they have to pay overtime to cover that. Then the differential line item 5115. You know that that's much smaller than the differential in the salary detail page. That 5115 line item is only for differential for dispatchers. All the other differentials for ranking patrol are included in 5100s. And for nights, they get an additional 9%. And at weekends, they get an additional 3%. And then finally, the stipends, 5116, 5162. I've listed the five different kinds of stipends and additional amounts they get for filling any of these roles. Then on the expenses side, absolutely no change. So just a quick overview of the staffing levels. Police patrol, they have 49 FTE ranking, 19 civilians, 9.44, and support is 10. Then for the vacancies, they have six in the police patrol and nine in ranking. The manager's budget book shows two vacancies and civilians. But apparently those people actually exist in those positions. And then there's one support vacancy. Okay, on to some of the issues. The police union contracts, they are currently in negotiations with the ranking officer union. It's in arbitration. This also covers the fiscal 21 to 24 contracts. And the two major issues are COLA increases and body-worn cameras. And this contract, once it's negotiated, will expire at the end of June, as will the ranking officer. So both of them will be out of contract as of July. So I assume negotiations will start up again after July. On the vacancy side, as I said, there are six in the police patrol. They've got four applying for the police academy. If they all get in and then graduate, that would leave two vacancies. At least at the time they graduate, who knows what will be then. One of the people taking the test in March is a dispatcher, so that will create a vacancy in that unit. And the chief said they had to go to the non-resident civil service list for the first time, which kind of shows what they're up against. For retirements, they have one in fiscal 24 and the ranking officer. And they anticipate there could be one in fiscal 25. In the civilians area, as I said, the two positions, which is the animal control officer and the SOFA worker position, are actually filled. So obviously that's a mistake in the manager's book. And then the dispatcher, the one vacancy they have, they're looking to fill. Any questions on vacancies?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brant? I worked really, really hard. I worked really hard thinking of one. Okay. You should get this one. So there's zero vacancies in the rank officers. And that means that all the, as you mentioned, the overtime shift, they have to have one to undo the overtime. Does that mean there's no hotel for rank officers?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer and John Griffin - 82</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, remember, if they're on vacation or on set, or, you know, whatever, whatever reason they're not available, cover shift. Otherwise, it is built in. I'll save the other one for later. Was there any discussion about how this affects operations? To this point, they seem to be managing by using overtime. I'll talk about it in a couple of slides. They are struggling with filling the vacancies they have and staying up to staff. But. They didn't bring up any operational.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sophie Migliazzo - 53</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophie. In the, in the vacancies listed, just looking at the previous folders, I see one. Looks like he was promoted to sergeant. Do we know why they have an idea of why the other ones have left or. Living. Other in some cases, if they've taken somebody off the non resident list.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think if the, there's a big, there's an opening in that town. They have to go back. And then as I'll talk about in a couple of minutes, it's not a great time to be a police officer. You know, all over the country. Gentlemen. Anyone. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might as well ask this one now. More high level animal control. In theory, different than practice. Why is that under police and not under like a social. Do they have any. Story or any.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. You know, going back used to be the dog office. But now it's more than just the dog. It's always come on. But the dog officer in the old days, he used to have some authority. No, they don't carry guns. Now, those days, they didn't have radios. They always contact. Situation. They're on the radio. It seems more of a, like a social. Type of thing, or it's possible it could be that. But I don't. Any. Has that ever been mentioned or brought up or any, any type of.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned about that ever before. I thought I've heard. Right. Thank you. Coming up. I'm just. I have a little bit of knowledge because I'm. Our liaison group. I've had a little bit of training. I think the issue is. You know, control officers calls are about off-leash dogs and things like that. And it's just really good. If he or she's wearing a patch. You know, try to enforce the dog. That's better. Better if you were. One more notice. They have the authority to issue a citation. It's a violation of the. Absolutely.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the department have an explicit policy in favor? Yes. Anything about hiring. Family members. Never come up. I don't know. I don't know. Against or for any. And I. Help with that question. Historically. It's always been a lot. Presently, there are three brothers. When I worked, I had a brother. Chief John Carroll had two other brothers. Historically. It's been a lot. I don't know. I don't know. John. I'm not sure. I'm going to get into about the civil service. You don't. The importance of civil service and how they're looking into that. Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. Yeah.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer and John Griffin - 464</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Discussions. Yes. All right. So staffing challenges. And I said, they're increasingly challenged. Stay up to full staffing levels. Chief showed a very. Compelling. 30 years ago. There were 400 applicants taken. And. Being coming in police officers. Attractive as it used to be. There's. That's a training. And then I think the one that's really. Difficult. Increased. Public scrutiny and. You can come down and sort of either side of that. You know, I personally think generally public scrutiny is a good thing, but you can understand. You know, I don't think it's a good thing to just think about if you have to carry around a camera. Your job or your day. So you can understand that. One of the measures that they're trying to take is to. It's to get out of some of the civil service. Requirements. The city council. Asked a measure to withdraw from civil service for hiring purposes. Only. Approved by town meeting. And that was stuck in the legislature. This would allow the town to recruit. The particular point of interest. Is to allow the town to recruit non-residents. So they wouldn't have to. Just deal with the list. So that's one of the measures that they're trying to take. Generally unions don't. Want to fully lead civil service. Without being compensated for. They'll do that. And. Negotiated. 5% increase. And I lost a bullet point somewhere here that there are some. Apparently the. Firefighters union and some of the veterans groups are. Not supportive of. The fire department. Then for the dispatchers. I learned this year. Both the dispatchers and the master mechanic of sheriff. Fire department. Whatever. I didn't know that. The dispatchers used to be a career. You might remember. It would be there for many years. Apparently now it's really become a stepping stone. For the fire department. And then moving up to. But it means that. Where the dispatchers used to be able to sort of manage themselves. Now, there's so many new people coming in and out. That's much more. So the chief would like to get a position and hire a full-time dispatch supervisor. We asked Chief Kelly as well and we support her. The position is currently filled by a full-time person who's half-time on managing the dispatchers, even though she's never been a dispatcher. And the other part of her job is a crime analyst. And then that's increasingly difficult because with the establishment of the Arlington Civilian Police Advisory Commission, there's an increased demand for transparency and data. So that person really needs to get back to the crime analysis part of her job. To this point, for whatever reason, they haven't gotten the manager to agree to request that position. Questions on this slide?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell them. Yeah, the Civilian Police Advisory Committee is that set up and running? I think it's starting. It was approved last year? I think it was longer ago than that. No, we approved it the time of year last year. I believe. In 2023, not 2022. It took a long time to appoint. Okay. Charlie?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 73</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse me. Thank you, Madam Chairman. I'm not sure that this applies to this slide, but a couple of years ago, some members of the Finance Committee did a report on the police department. You might remember that. I did that. And it was quite an excellent report and very comprehensive. I'm wondering if you came across any patterns of change, good or bad, in the police department since that report was done?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer - 91</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only one, and to be honest, at these budget meetings, we tend to focus mostly on the budget, whereas that report was much more expansive than that. I think the only thing I've noticed is that the hiring challenges are getting more pronounced. I don't know if dire is the right word, but they're up against it with that. Whereas I think even a couple of years ago, and John, I don't know if you sort of detected the same, it's sort of half kind of resignation and half frustration.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Griffin - 22</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, they are able to find new recruits, but it's getting harder and harder. So that's the impression I got.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Josh Lobel - 59</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh, thank you. Thank you on that subject with the change in civil service, give them a much bigger pool that helped them more. They've been able to recruit non-residents. Right. People who are on that specific civil service list. Right. And there's nothing that can be done to expedite that to the legislature. What's the hold up there?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 139</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't get the legislature to do much they don't want to do, so no. I think the explanation which Daryl referenced was you need to sign off by the state legislature and apparently the firefighters, the veterans don't want to touch it. Even though it sounds like a small change, they don't want to make a small change because they're afraid to do that. Well, they like the civil service. So that more of the problem, or would you blame the legislature for going so slow? Would you blame the legislature for going so slowly? Would you blame internal bickering? Because I think there's a media perspective. All these things happen so slowly. I think it's a combination. I think with the legislature, there tends to be inertia anyway. And then not having full throated support doesn't help.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 58</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you know, I've worked for the state most of my career. And it's a fact of life in dealing with anything in the legislature that even something that everybody thoroughly supports still can take a long time to get through. It really depends on what else is on their queue, where they are in the legislative calendar.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Josh Lobel - 60</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. Like they would bring up Arlington's request and vote on it as a separate issue? I don't think Arlington is the problem. I think it's the. There's five other towns in that bill. I see. I don't remember what they were. I don't know what they were. It's a whole new petition. Yeah, a whole new petition. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alan Jones - 69</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alec Jones. Thank you. I go back to the dispatcher, dispatcher supervisor question. I guess I always thought the comm supervisor supervised the dispatchers. But I guess I'm wrong. You know, the difference has been. I think I think that's the position. I didn't look if I was putting this together. That's the only position. But that's full-time. It is a full-time position. It's just split between two roles.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer or John Griffin and Alan Jones - 154</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did you reference? Yeah. It's in the same box as all the dispatchers. I assume that was a person who supervised the operation. But I may be wrong. I have a belief that the chief wants a dispatch supervisor. Full-time. Full-time. This is a full-time job. Must be talking about a different job description. I'm confused about that. It's possible. They started that. It wasn't called Conrad's Way. They started that under the previous chiefs. But when the designated supervisor retired, it went away. So there was no. Then it went back to the shift commanders. The responsibility for the dispatchers. Then there was a change again. Although there's dispatching going on downstairs for both police and fire. When the fire went back to the headquarters, there was a change there too. What was the job description of Smith, the comm supervisor? I have no idea. I believe we can clarify this.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alan Jones - 117</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my thought is that because both the fire chief and the police chief referenced the part-time. There is a part-time dispatch supervisor who also spends a lot of time as a crime analyst. We heard that from both of them. So that definitely sounds like that's the facts. So I'm thinking that this Smith is half comm supervisor and a half crime analyst. Because I don't see any. I don't see anyone. Yeah, I couldn't find another position. Okay, because it's one FTE. Yeah, but I don't see anyone with a 0.5 FTE. Yeah, but it's basically half on each. So even though it says comm supervisor with 1.0 FTE, I think it's a half dispatcher.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 111</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem they've got is she doesn't really have the correct experience. Well, that's a hybrid. And then secondly, the demands on her being asked to do crime analysis are increasing. Right. The full-time comm supervisor is doing crime analysis on the side. Vice versa. Yeah. Well, okay. But the position is called the comm supervisor. Yeah, there's no position. One FTE. I think it was the way the chief explained it. Prior, Chief Ryan needed a crime analyst. Okay. And the only way to get it was to position it as a dispatch supervisor. And the crime analyst was a police officer at one time. Yeah. And then they switched.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sophie Migliazzo - 134</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other questions, Sophie? Um, so I had the same question, but to follow up a bit more, did I understand this is supposed to be, they work part-time for fire and part-time for police, though? They're shared, yeah. So the calls come in. I thought in the past when things were shared, it would be a 0.5 under the police budget and 0.5 under the fire budget. The dispatchers are all under police. The master mechanic is under fire, fully. Yeah. Okay. Maybe you just want a record keeping. Okay. And then the other salary question I had was, on the positions of civilians, there are two positions that are not one FTEs, they're part-time. One being a social worker. I'm just curious, did they mention the need to increase the social worker position?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer - 57</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that position is shared between police and health and human services. But do we see the 0.25 somewhere else? Should be in the health and human services budget. So just like, okay, but we don't split the dispatchers between fire and police, but we split the... The call would be a fire or police come in.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sophie Migliazzo - 75</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I'm just, I'm just confused because sometimes, and I didn't mean for it to be this one, but so I'm, the answer is the social... I was asking a social worker why it wouldn't be up to a one, why it's only a part-time. And the answer is it is full-time, but 0.25 is somewhere else. But then on the dispatchers, which is shared, police, fire, it's one on police and zero on fire.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Darrel Harmer and Sophie Migliazzo - 173</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps because it's all public safety. Part of the reason they do fall under, I remember when we used to do a lot of this like 10 years or so ago, kicked and screamed on it, is there was a large push for personnel to be in the budget of the person that they report to. So like, if you're, like, that's why, like, for example, we did on the first day when we were talking about the audit. So technically the auditors report to the select board, which is why they're in the select board. Even though the select board sees them twice a year, shakes their hand, thanks them so much, grabs a book and walks out. So that's, and I think that happened with... So the social worker who's police civilian, wouldn't that argue? We always argue, 10 years ago, we used to argue to put in the budget for supporting. Social worker probably came after we did all that arguing. And so who does the social worker report to?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Annie LaCourt - 217</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie? I believe the social worker has two different supervisors, but I also think there's a little bit of comment going on here. It's just, we don't follow the same pattern always in how we're budgeting. And they happened to split this position as budget responsibility and they didn't put the dispatchers. So... And is that split 75%, 25% still a fair split between responsibilities and who they respond to? I think... I have not heard from HHS that they feel like we need more than the 0.25. I think that if we're going to determine where the need is the greatest, it's actually in the police department. And they actually only use two full-time people and they don't have... It's a support for officers who are dealing with requests to handle people who are in distress, who are not criminals. They're just suffering a breakdown or the homeless population who can be in a little hospital sometimes, and so you have to use coverage to support the social worker. And it's been a good system. Well, that's why I thought maybe it needed to go up to one. Yeah. I personally would love it to go up to one, but, you know, everybody's got to request it and we end up with others for it, so...</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allie? Yeah, I don't see 0.25 for social worker. Yeah. I'm pretty confident they share it. I'm pretty confident. Okay. Maybe it's grant funding or something. I'm just not seeing it right now. Sorry. They didn't grant funding. There's Edenburg. Edenburg. It's funding that social worker. Edenburg. Is it, in fact, vacant? I think they said it was to actually ask that question. Let's take this up on human services. Any additional questions?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dean Carman - 339</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean, I guess I have one question. It's not really about trying to reconcile, like, different things we hear in the committee over the course of several years. So, in your presentation, you spoke about how they were having difficulty recruiting individual to be government police officers, which I understand. I take that as solved, right? In the fall, the deputy town manager was giving us the patrolman's contract. He talked about how they were a powerful and sympathetic group. So, you're having difficulty recruiting them. So, those contradict, right? Like, downstate, to me, is not jive with this, okay? And then we see a lot of public sentiment in the state that sort of, I just call it, not very favorable towards policing, policing. But then they're powerful in the legislature on home rule petitions. Like, those don't jive. Like, something's de-linking here. As long as they're not powerful enough. Unions are very powerful in the state. And the state legislature listens to unions. Whatever union it happens to be. They're powerful if they, yeah, they're powerful if you accept the premise of the power, right? If you don't accept the premise of the power, they're not powerful, right? Like, they contribute to campaigns. So, that's it, right? Yeah, but if I'm, you know. So, it's not that they're powerful. I'm a legislator, and I've got the police who may be a little warm about it. And a buyer who's not liking it at all. Don't you? I'm not gonna do anything. Right, so, the fair way to say it is, the Controllment Association, go to the bottom. They're not sympathetic right now. You're right. They're just, they're powerful. So, it's raw power. It's not, like, sympathy and mopping out the pot. It's okay. That's true. I just don't want to paint us a picture of, like, you know, care and stuff like that when it's not. Well, I think it depends on, you know, each individual police officer, or potential police officer, what animates them or not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stefan? Yeah, just to this. Thank you for this, Fred. I think, too, that the assistant deputy manager. Could you speak up a little bit, please? Yeah, I think the deputy manager last year said that the police were very unified across their industry. So, the next area will, of course, not be controversial at all, so we'll just breeze through this. Body-worn hammers. This has been, this issue has been around for quite a while. So, the department bought 70 hammers for patrol officers to eventually use once the bargaining issues are resolved. That's $60,000 from the asset forfeiture fund, which for those of you who don't know, this fund has come up in previous years. They can use it for police equipment and training, but they can't use it for recurring costs. So, they're buying the cameras all up front. They got a 15% discount. When she, when the chief said this, my first thought was, depending on how long it takes to actually deploy the cameras, who's to say that the cameras are going to be current by then? But they're covered through the contracts. The life of the contract, that accent will keep them current through that five-year term. For ongoing funding, they will request operating budget increase to cover future recurring costs. They're going to try to find and apply for grants. And then the town meeting appropriation, which I know happened. I couldn't, I look forward to this happening. I couldn't find what year it happened. I don't know what year it already is. So, $42,000 is still untapped. Then the patrol officers are in arbitration on the cameras. The outstanding issue is the union wants to incorporate the body camera policy into the contract, which would mean then any change in the policy would have to be bargained, which is obviously a complicated factor. When and if the policy is implemented, the patrol officers will get a 2% increase. And then the camera issue is also in arbitration with the ranking officers. But apparently it's separate from the money parts of the contract. And then both the patrol and ranking officers have to agree to the cameras before they can be deployed. So it can't be one, the other, the group instead of both. Then just to close the loop, I took the email that Tom Anderson and Charlie just put it in in case anybody missed it. This really talked about how they'll manage the footage and the imaging imagery to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands or into the wrong hands. And then the other thing that I did was to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands or people who don't want to be on the image part. All right. Body worn camera is not a big deal. So any questions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for- Yeah, so you said that both the patrol officers and the ranking officers are taking this body worn camera policy to arbitration. Is this two different arbitrators? In other words, could they end up with either not the same rulings or not so contradictory, but it might be- It's two different arbitrations. I don't know if it could end up with the same arbitrator. No, right. But so they could, it sounds like it could end up- They could, and they have to be the same or cameras can't be deployed. So they both have to agree to... So the arbitrators have to agree. Right. Well, you have to have to do it. Okay. I'll go. I'm wondering if we should consider moving $10,000 that was added to the IT budget to the police budget, which is dedicated to the body-worn cameras. Because what I read the line for request operating budget increases that cover future costs, recurring costs. I assume it means the police budget, but I think... Yeah, I don't know. Did that $10,000 for the additional fiber length? Yeah. The manager stuck that in the IT budget, but I'm wondering... I think most network services are in the IT budget. Yeah. Okay. Somehow it seems more transparent if it's put in with the same as the operating cost of the cameras. Topher may have some information here.</blockquote>

So they've already done that, is my understanding. And so they've spent $10,000. So at this point, I think any future, anything going forward will be in the police budget. Because it isn't $10,000 a year? I think this was just to run to install the wire. Okay. That would be $10,000 a year. I think that was the... I didn't get your impression. I didn't double check. Okay. Well, when we get to the IT budget, because... Yeah. Because there was an expense increase request for IT for $10,000 for that. Maybe that's just a one-time cost. Right. I'll double check. Okay. It just seems like operating costs for this one might be better off in the police budget. That's all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. The work for the police. Not a lot of movement last year. Salaries. Oh, Bob. 49,000 or so. Which is primarily factual. Speed credit up 50,000. Also in the contract. And then when you get to the expenses. No movement at all. In the prior year. Or vacancies. No vacancy on. Well, firefighters. One big vacancy. Is the master mechanic. So. The master mechanic. For many, many years. You will be sorely missed. Did work over above his position. They have an interviews. Early February. You're going to open. Fill that. Quickly. Some. So anyway. So the master mechanic is the key vacancy. And they really hope to fill that very quickly. The person retired and not. He is. He has left some big shoes to fill. That's that's what they're focusing on regarding hiring. So. I have to dive into it again, but we did hear about. Dispatches. That is not technically a fire. They could see, but they are also open to. You know, Span. To a full-time position. So. The. The biggest thing, which we have heard a little bit about, we heard about it last week when the town manager was here is the ambulance. Offsets. And, you know, it's kind of thing you hear about over and over again. So I'll try to be brief here. So. Arlington. So first of all, stepping back a bit. The firefighters. Are trained. Basic light service. That's BLS. They are not trained for advanced life service. In order to get the ALS, they need Armstrong. And assist. Historically. Arlington. Armstrong. Armstrong would come in. And. Transport. The ALS services. They would get 60% of the revenue. And it didn't. That's how we got. Yeah. I'm strong. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. So you're right. Armstrong provided the services. Our town. Actually do the transporting. Armstrong. Armstrong would get 60% of the revenue. And the kind of, I can get 40% of the revenue. Okay. Through COVID. It was just a shortage. Endless services. Across the board. It is. It is statewide. You do read about it in the newspaper. It's actually just a terrible. Is it. I think. A few weeks ago. Or there was a tragedy related to slow ambulance services. So it is. Kind of statewide thing. Having a hard time to fill these. To meet these needs. So, so, so, so I was talking to the town of Arlington. They said, can you dedicate. Have dedicated ALS. Ambulance services. In town of Arlington. They said, sure. But we need, we need to be able to fill in. Keep 100%. So that's where it stands now. They now, they now provide the transport service. Yeah. They provide the kind of. They have a dedicated ambulance. Thanks for clarification. They have a dedicated ambulance. They provide the services. They bill it and they keep the money. 100%. So we, that was that 40% that we received a connection with the ALS. Made up the offsets. That's that's. Going, going gone. It's not. Pretty low this year. On the flip side. We did hear that the BLS billing is actually up because. The city of Arlington, which is the largest city in the United States, has a lot of services. So they can, they can. Provide. 100% of those services, which they effectively are. So she Kelly did. It was pretty confident. We certainly didn't see the numbers, but he's pretty confident that these BLS buildings are out over the last two years. Why do we see that here? That goes right into the general fund. So. I don't know. I don't know if it's net zero with all of this. However, because. The. ALS buildings are now going 100% to Armstrong. The offset is going away. So, you know, I like to say we've kind of heard. We've heard that two or three times last year. This is probably the second time we've heard it this year. So. It shouldn't be new.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Any questions so far. Sure. Charlie. Annie. Thank you. Chair. I have two questions. One goes back to the overtime. And the other one goes back to the vacancy. Yeah. So, but the overtime. Which I have. Always heard. Was planned. The cover. The band because of vacancy. Yep. Seems to be. Pretty constant. Yeah. And actually told us sent that question over. So we did that address it to the chief. And his response, which did make some sense to me. If you go back to 2022. Which when they did have a hard time filling. The vacancy. Now it's down to. You know, a small fraction of that. I'd say maybe 5%. So, you know, why is it even a number at all? It should be zero. He says, no, because, you know, as Darrell mentioned, the police, you always going to have holidays. Firefighters out. Sick things like that. So there's always some kind of need. Maybe special events. I don't know. I don't know. And you can see it's the exact same as last year. So he says it's. He says that's just. Necessary. Second question is. Discussion about the ALS versus the BLS. And splitting in between the town and Armstrong. How does it determine that at all? I don't know. I don't know. That's a great question. You know, I'm sure, you know, there's any doubt. They probably. Call Armstrong. Maybe they do it all site. So I don't know the exact requirement. I'm sure there's a lot of judgment involved. So. I don't know. I assume. Maybe it sounds like BLS and they get there and they. They call immediately. I assume they try to come. That's fine. And. How are we getting the sellers? Did they say, did they have. I don't know. You know, it's it's. I think. What it comes down to really is. The union negotiations, which none of this reflects any union. Any. New contract. New contract. I see next, next year. 2024. So you'd expect to see that cost of living. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Turnover. In other words, like, you know, Yeah. What happens if you don't. They either get no increase. If there's no. Contract. When you get. The same sort of way to increase. Yeah. Do you remember Dave? I'm not sure. Yeah. So possible because they're in a contract. There's probably. That's a good question. Like, you know, Like this isn't even two and a half percent. This is. And this is like. Yeah, this is. Like really. Yeah. Well, it looks like. Some changes in personnel and. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, now I'm going to get 12% of questions over. I'll run through his questions. So we already talked about the overtime. The vacation. Account. Or line item five, one Oh six. That's actually vacation. They can purchase a vacation. Yeah. So, you know, No one knows exactly how much vacation we purchased at the end of the year. Bring it aside. Same month, last year. When you say. I guess the town. Right now. That's that. Yeah. Fire sciences. Which ones are fire science. And now the next question, what is hospital medical care? Com five to five line item five to five seven. That's a really interesting one. I feel like it's one that we should keep an eye on. If you notice in 2022, it was all the way up to 95,000. So, you know, I think it's probably going to be a little bit higher next year. I don't know. I think it's going to be a little bit higher next year. That is when the fire department. The workers comp claim to me seems crazy, but it's only because. You know, apparently we're self-insuring when it comes to workers comp. So if someone does file a work. Claim. Time manager sends it over. The specific department. So. You know, it seems to me. That almost like. I don't know if it's going to come next year. Who knows? Hopefully not much. That's even if, even if firefighters along. Yeah. Self-insured. Usually means that we are. We're paying the first X number of a hundred thousand dollars in insurance. And then we buy what's called reinsurance. Yeah. Major, major. Millions of dollars. But then we have to collect premiums from employees to cover that premium. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, 95,000 seems like a lot, but. There was a $62,000. That year. Yeah. Yeah. I remember. It was one. Person that apparently. Was going in for it and happened to mention that. He worked for the fire department. You're parked up. Yeah. Yeah. So the offsets we already talked about. The master mechanic. Actually my notes here said they haven't interviewed the very seven. The master mechanic vision. And then the breakdown of the calls. Actually she Kelly just sent this over yesterday. I'll put it up on SharePoint. I didn't get a chance. Yeah. So. Data available. There was a total of 50. 5,709. Reclaims. Excuse me. Calls 5,700. 3,800. We're emergency medical. So that's clearly the biggest, you know, Almost 60% emergency medical. Call. After that, the largest number is. Fire alarms. Going off. Interestingly. Fire. There was 63 calls with actual fires. Yeah. But there's 10, 10 or 12 different categories. I'll put this up on SharePoint. Okay. Questions grant and then Michael. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Non-budget. And I won't ask Darrell because. Brought that. the breakdown was and since it's going to the same dispatch, but that's fine. Thank you. I was just curious about the whole process, but it's not a budgetary, you know, like when they get the medical call, how do they know if it's been in the hole and who does he go through and how he gets dispatched? It's not a budget. So the dinner party will be interesting to see what the categories are, you know, from fire, it seems like it would be easier to divide categories for police. I don't know. I really haven't had any kind of assault or break-ins. Yeah. I was actually more about how much is fire and how much is police, but. Yeah, what's the total? It's 5,793 versus what the police have. It doesn't matter what's happening. The police go on every fire call. In this town, the police go on every emergency call, rescue call, or fire call. So when you see all three of them, that's because the call came in for advanced life services. When you only see two, it's probably the basic. Because I'm so, you always think about that, you know, you see the long truck coming, but that's probably why. It isn't. It's a system in place depending on which area of town. Okay? What goes to, like up to Heifers, what goes down to East Arlington or the center. That, and the next thing is, sometimes it's a judgment call on the dispatcher. So what type of emergency calls are coming in? And that's not also when the rescue gets there, they're all EMTs. They're not paramedics. Although some are on the outside, they're paramedics, but not to speak of the town. So they make the call to the dispatcher, send the backup. Thank you. It's a process.</blockquote>

To add one more thought to this question about why all these vehicles go, and so on and so forth. When I first got on the select board, I actually went and did a tour with each of the chiefs of, you know, sort of all their facilities, and talked to them about what everybody does. And trust me, there are very good reasons why the vehicles that are 70%. And it's important, it's necessary, it's public safety, it's being sure you can deal with whatever situation you run into when you arrive, so on and so forth. So it may seem crazy to just have three vehicles, but they're really necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked about the new online permitting system. He was very enthusiastic that it's worked great. They are doing some tweaking, but for any of you that have been involved in IT project implementations, stuff that's a little unusual is that the complex stuff actually worked really well, and they've had more trouble with the simple stuff. She didn't know how it worked, so he's actually pretty lucky. It was down this weekend. And then they had to get IT to code some reports. I did ask if there was any kind of report generator so they could write their own, not have to depend on IT, and he said that there was, so I think it's just them learning the system. But basically, anybody can get an open Gov account and access the system. And I said that they're pretty happy with it. One of the interesting things is I mentioned a couple of years ago that a prior inspection services department had made the interesting decision to do all their filing by year instead of address. And I was like, well, how does that work? So my house goes back to 1929, so theoretically, if I wanted to pull every permit on my house, I would have to go year by year. So he said one of the things they're doing is they're shifting it to by address. The permitting system is, obviously, it does allow for scanning of all the various associated plans and other documents. So they're building their digital records, which is really the direction they should go. That kind of solves all their potential sorting problems. They could sort out whatever they wanted to do. Then he did provide the permit revenue. This also is on SharePoint, by the way, that's including that permit report. So for fiscal 23 actuals, the amount of revenue was $2,823,929. For 24, they're estimating at $2,350,000. So going down some, but not through the floor. And he said he is seeing the volume go down. Definitely more rentals than demos and new construction. And then I guess new energy codes that went into effect January 1st are also slowing things down. So all in all, the revenue picture is not bad considering interest rates and so on.

So there's standards of truth presented today that we're gonna go through one by one. I don't want you to find out from separate papers, so you want to go as one bunch? Separately, probably. Yes, separate. Okay, so let's start with Health and Human Services. Christine Bondermo got promoted this year to Deputy Manager for Corporate Operations. And so we got a big recess on the salaries in the health department. There was a cascading move up with a subsequent reset on salaries. That's the 11% decrease in salary. And so it's just reduction in cost of home revenue and so on and so forth. Not really clear from the information here, but that reset on the director's salary was about what was a lot. I want to say Christine was making closer to 150 to 154 if you look at the 24 budget. So that's a big chunk of that reset, but there were a couple other salary lines that were also reset as well. So overtime longevity, pretty much staying the same. Longevity obviously is down, same reason. Auto allowance is just for health inspectors moving around the town. The expenses are all pretty flat. There was a question about what the contracted services are. So the contracted services, Mr. Hanward and everybody, is our contribution to the Somerville Homeless Coalition, which is an organization that we work with to get homeless in Arlington's boundaries housed. And also that we contract out our sealer of weights and measures. So it's the combination of those two things that is covered by contracted services. The road control is, obviously the actuals for 2022 or 2023 are lower than that, but I do know that they are continually working on being more and more innovative about how we get rid of rats because there's rats all over the city. We think it would just be a restaurant-related thing, but it's not. And we do try to do things like use dry ice and so on and so forth that are not the poisons that are killing birds. And I don't know, we had a note on this, didn't we? More on guns? Yeah. Somewhere in the email, we should talk a little bit about this. They do feel like they have enough money to continue to work at it. So we're not gonna see an increase in that budget. Mosquito control is all about mosquito-borne disease. This is all about keeping us all from dying of some horrible tropical disease. I think that's everything under health and human services. Do folks have questions on this? Rebecca, did you want to add something? I just wanted to add, if you notice on the offsets that the significant decrease in offsets is due to the ARPA money going away. And so due to that decrease in ARPA money, we're also down one health compliance officer. Health compliance officer. Yes, so previously we had one additional position as a health compliance officer, which was ARPA funded. So when the ARPA went away, we lost the health. Yeah. This is the last year ARPA will appear in our budget supporting personnel. I think Jim said that at the meeting. We also have confirmation from the department heads. Other questions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alan Jones. Just comment on the rat control. They're using something called sport boxes, which are electrocution boxes, which collect the rat bodies. The beauty of that is it collects the data of how many rats are caught over a period of time. So they can actually use it to say, if they go to a restaurant and say, you have a rat problem, fix your dumpster. They put a box there and they can actually see if the population goes down to see if the problem is solved. So it's a really smart thing. And there goes Chris. Rat problem. Great. I think rat boxes. I think. Connected rat boxes. Other questions? Any other questions? Well, health and human services. Comfort, I think I've covered everything that appears in this section. So I move approval of a taxation total for health and human services of 735,666. Second.</blockquote>

<summary>Veteran Services</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 975</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, veteran services. The biggest jump here is the salary of the the one before you, which is the veteran services. There is a changeover and I believe that the previous veteran services director had been working less than full time towards the end and hence the jump. It was also true that when we discussed this and this happened in several conversations with these departments, I was getting covered. And so, to get someone with representative experience, they couldn't come in at a lower salary than this. And that is the biggest expense. The veterans aid and assistance expenses, you get a big chunk of that back from the state. So, we budget for it, but then money comes into the federal funds to cover most of it. I don't believe it's 100%, but it's like 85%. Questions? Signs. There's signs. Oh gosh, I don't remember. We asked this question last year. I think they're there to add new veteran memorial information to the various funds. That's good. The note I have from last year says, this expense goes towards the preservation and restoration of military markers and signs throughout town. Director recently restored the sign at the entrance of the old burial grounds and then moved those to the town. Yeah, thank you. Other questions? So, also to follow up, so that was the one for last year's budget. So, I'm assuming the new director hasn't told you which signs he's updating with the new 5,000. That would be a follow-up question, just so we can keep track of those. I do not know which signs. Okay. And then, looking back at last year's, my understanding was the director of veteran services previously had been serving a long time and he wasn't a 1.0 FTE. I think the reason that the budget was lower in 2014 was that in that year, he only worked part-time. Something so solid would have been lower if he worked full-time. That was what came up in the conversation when we asked about whether Joe budgeted at 1.0. I mean, that's the full amount that was budgeted. Yeah, I don't, I think you might be thinking. So, one reason that 2023 is higher than the budget is because that was a buyout of the person's contract. Any actual, any actual, that is what the actual job. So that, right, so, but the budget we're using for 2025 is still higher than what the previous guy was making, which is fine if that's what you need to hire, but I thought the previous one was long, huge longevity, it's been there a really long time. Yeah, I don't know. Okay, but when we asked about the difference between the 24 and the 25 budget, the response was, in part, that he was working non-full-time. Am I wrong? I think you're thinking of someone else. Someone else. Never mind, I'm lying to you. So, we'll go back and ask that question, but do you want to hold the budget for that? No, I'm just something to, I'm just trying to understand where we have longevity, presumably somebody who had been there for a while at such a lower pay compared to what somebody who came in at. Yeah. Alan? Which is, the 7572A is lower budgeted, so maybe there was some, you know, voluntary reduction in hours or something that baked back into the budget because the 24 budget is a natural, it's a budgetary number which doesn't match ours. So, in fact, the finance committee report will be zero increase. It'll be $82,324. I think it could be another one of those budget bubbles. Oh yeah, it's definitely another one of those budget bubbles. John, what's the nature of the $240,000 of aid and assistance? It's assistance for veterans with things like finding housing, helping cover housing costs, other services they may need to get some of those veterans to cross the board. The way that I think of this budget is that Arlington has an employee whose job is to essentially function as a liaison between the residents of Arlington who are veterans and the agencies which are meant to provide services for them, right? So, if you're a veteran and you don't have your discharge papers and you don't know how to get them, you call this person and they help put you in contact with it. So, most of that money, you know, as Annie said earlier, will actually be reimbursed by various veterans agencies, right? So, Arlington is effectively not paying for the actual services. We're paying for the person who helps facilitate people accessing the services they're entitled to. That's about it. Got it. And I think the Director of Veterans Services is also doing some community awareness on work, you know, when we get to Veterans Day Memorial Day and we are having veterans come speak at the schools and for, you know, parades, celebrations, flags, all those things. The Director of Veterans Services makes sure that happens. So, yeah. I think it's one of the cooler things we do. Yeah, no, it sounds great. I wonder, I mean, maybe if they broke it into two different line items, it seems like a large number would be, like, you know, a little bit of everything, but... I mean, we can make... No, not this year, but maybe... We can make a note on my list. Yeah. She says, looking at Tara, it's been taken away on her list. Yeah. Well, that reminds me, we had the same question about legal, right? That everything was in this bucket, and maybe the comptroller, like, something to go with Ida, or who was it, to go and discuss breaking out. New charter accounts, which is going into effect, but it's not in this budget. Other questions?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Various - 376</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, I believe they're reflective of what will be spent, but that the reimbursements come into the general fund. I don't think we see them here, so... With not the same comments that we had about the Select Board's budget, that money might be out to another person, if we know that it's actually not going to get spent? I'm sorry, I'm not following. Well, you're saying that, well, the actuals are, I don't know, almost 50 percent, not 50 percent, 40 percent less, or whatever, than what's budgeted. Yeah. So, is this getting the cash that's sitting there, plus you're saying you're getting reimbursed, so you're having even more money coming back to the general fund? But you get reimbursed only if you provide this. If the reimbursement doesn't come, it's the better it is for the same budget you're receiving. So, I think what you're asking for is a better accounting picture of exactly how that cash flows, so we should hold that to a list. Let me see what I can figure out. Sorry, later. I think to follow up, I think Josh's point is that consistently, it looks like we're consistently budgeting $240,000. We're consistently having lower actuals, so this would be one to drill down on. Yes, that's what I'm saying. We should go get the reports and see what's going on. If you look at the whole budget, it's actually a pretty big percentage of the whole budget. So, according to our discussion with them, they said that a minimum of 75% of the expenses expended are reimbursed by the state under certain conditions, so emergency housing, disaster support, etc., are reimbursed 100% by the state. So, I think it depends exactly what the veteran needs, how much is reimbursed by the state, but it is a minimum of several hundred percent. Right, but that's not coming in. I mean, that's not my question, right? I mean, I'm not looking at the reimbursement. I'm looking at the budget versus actuals, but going back in the 2020, the actual in 2020 was almost $240,000, or $238,000 in 2020. It has to do with, there's a change in population over time, right, depending on... And you don't know what that population is.</blockquote>

We get it back from the state later, but they budget so that they have the funds to provide the services when they need it. Right, the cash flow issues.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, how's Vaughn aging? 1.6. Okay. Salaries. There's a big jump in salary. There is one commission in particular that took a big jump. This was a requested reclass and then a subsequent negotiation that resulted in a $13,000 increase in annual salary. Anything else about that? And that's probably the biggest effect on those salaries, and I believe the rest of it is all changes in status and longevity. And then, obviously, everything else is pretty flat, and offsets are up a little bit. So, what we have is a 7% increase in the total budget. Can I just have the offset come there from the state executive office of elder affairs? That is intended to cover a couple of physicians, basically. Geriatric nurse and one of the social workers, I believe, are covered by the state. Questions? Anyone have any questions? Thank you. I did actually get to this question in advance.

Are the positions eliminated? It will be gone the following year. It's currently in this budget, but it will disappear next year. 26. Correct. FY 26, it will be gone. The positions? It will be, it will be gone unless they find the money somewhere else. Okay, thank you. Following up on that, if they don't find the money, do they have a plan? No, the plan is they will be looking for other sources of funding. That was the most I could get. Yeah. Other questions? So, um, on the consulting, the equity dashboard, say that's so they have to hire someone from outside to build that, as opposed to, I guess, the directors. I'm just kind of curious, what kind of consultants? I didn't ask them to give a breakdown, because at this point in their budget cycle, they wouldn't be able to tell you that it's this much for this and this much for that. I would suspect that that dashboard is not the bulk of the money. But yeah, since I sort of do that for a living, I wouldn't be surprised if they're hiring somebody to build it. It may not be, it might be something in the capacity of the IT department, which depends on what data, what tools and how it's going to be pulled together, but they might be getting some help to design it, figure out what metrics are and so forth. The, but when we talk about capacity building and training, and, you know, implementing the recommendations in the plan, I suspect that's the bulk. You know, what do you mean by capacity building? So building staff capacity, and you can use volunteer capacity to respond to the problems discovered by the equity audit. So working with the Human Rights Commission, the Rainbow Commission, and probably a lot of internal. employee work, and so forth, the issues that were raised by New York people. So, looking back, historically, the consulting, there was talk about something, consultants from Powerful Pathways, and it was for staff and residents, are they still doing that, those kinds of consultations, or is this different now? I believe Powerful Pathways was the chosen consultant in the first year, and that was Right, and that's not what it is anymore. No, I think this is mostly internal at this point, but I mean, I don't have the equity audit in front of me, but I know there were very specific recommendations for things to do. Al?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, Enterprise Funds. Arlington Youth Consultation Center. What was it, Kenneth? Enterprise Funds. Oh, they're now? 13-1. What? 13-1, right? Yes. 13-1-0, yeah. This is page 171. So, starting with the salaries, you'll see that there's a fairly substantial increase. I believe this is the addition of some additional staff positions. Or was it something else? But mostly to meet demand. Remember, most of the income coming into AYCC comes in through insurance billings, and there are currently 425 young people and their families being served, and there's 200 on the waiting list. So, they want to add some capacity in order to meet that demand. The trend is up, I would say. Pretty much everything else is steady state except for administrative fees. The administrative fees cover the cost of electronic health records, billing systems, Zoom health, HIPAA-compliant Google applications, DocuSign fees, and Lexi Key Interpreter and Translation Services. So, it's all software infrastructure, basically, to be able to run the department and also to be able to use Tallahassee in particular. So, that's a nice big increase in expenses and salaries. I'm just making note, if you're looking at the bottom right of page 174, where it should say the dollar change and the percent change, as we had the problem last week, the dollar change and the percent change, those are just old numbers that are unrelated to this budget. So, you should look directly at the 2024 budget and the 2025 budget and just, in your head, look at what the difference is. Ignore what it claims the percent change is. It does not reflect the actual budget. It's not necessarily accurate. And so, the revenue. So, there's CDBG funding. There's some intergovernmental revenue, which I believe is school departments using AYC services, state revenue, client fees, and insurance reimbursement. They do have a gifts and donations app with the town, and you can make a donation to AYCC, and that then is used in this gifts and donations line. The $120,000 transfer from other funds is the town's contribution to support AYCC. That's money that comes out of the general fund. And then there is some ARPA funding, and I don't think that use of retained earnings is at all relevant. That, I think, also has inaccurate in the last two columns. Yeah, and then again, you will see the ARPA offset, which I believe is going away at the end of this year. So, I think I'm ready for questions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, yeah, I guess there's a retained earnings account. There was some confusion about the difference between that and the gifts and donations account, but there has to be a specific account used to hold the funds if you contribute to a town department, and that's what that gifts and donations line is. That's where it's coming out of, basically, to be spent. It's just a necessary state law-amended method of accounting for donations made from the outside. But people write checks to AYCC. And they do. Yeah. Last year, we talked about that was coming out, though, that whole mind-speak deletion is what we said last year, but that's not. Yeah. There was a new director, because Christine looked up, okay, and she wasn't sure what the actual budgeting and accounting requirement was. So, that's another thing that's going to go on my list to get the comptrollers written out for me. I'll see if I can get that information for everybody before the end of the budget cycle. But regardless, if they're learning and have a right to use it, they can just use it in the budget. And as you can see, the budget basically balances. Charlie, you had your hand up.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Various - 559</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct. That whole column is a mess. The whole column is a mess. Yeah. So, then if I look at the 23 actual 24 budget and 25 budgets, it looks like the expenses are increasing 200,000 a year. That wasn't surprising to me at all. The demand for the services is increasing rapidly. And youth mental health is, youth having mental health issues is on the rise, particularly since COVID, and we're not. But in the past, Christine, she used to increase the revenues for this. Almost to a break even point. And we were still putting in $120,000 from the town. And if the Arbor money goes away, that's another thousand. I'm just wondering if you discuss whether or not they see this improving or not improving or what's the plan. Well, I didn't discuss that with Conan. I could go back and discuss it with her. I think the same rule applies that when the Arbor money goes away, whatever it's funding goes away. And. Yeah. I think didn't specifically specify a position that that money is supporting. I don't know. I don't know. They do have the option to raise more money, but the town has always made a contribution to AYCC. Something close to that amount. In fact, when I was on the select board, We caught our contribution to AYCC. Helped them move to an enterprise fund model where they were making money. They were not being very good about billing insurance. I'm just trying to understand. If there's a trend. Different donations may not show up next year. And it'd be. The. Yeah. So $50,000 of that hundred thousand dollars. They do also have a charitable corporation that has $700,000 as a balance. And then they also do run their. Who has the 700,000. The AYCC has a charitable corporation. Oh, and that. That shows up in that one as well. If they withdraw from there. It would appear. The balance and that is. So the real. The real. Risk here is. Yes. Our thought. Okay. Okay. But I do believe the town is going to continue to contribute that hundred and $20,000. Because it offsets costs for people who either don't have insurance or can't afford. The. Insurance. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's important. Here. Okay. And is that realistic? It is very realistic for this to continue. Trend. If they expand services. I think it's also realistic to. In terms of the backlog, are they think of expanding further or well, that's what the additional positions in this budget and the jump in the salaries is they're expanding by passing by a couple of people. And so I think they want to continue to expand to meet the demand. As long as they believe that the reimbursements will keep up with that. But aren't they servicing? You said about 400 families or something. 425. And then back like 200. About 15 people. I don't think they're going to add 50% more capacity. I mean, there's also an in and out. Right.

Sophie. Looking at this. Personnel. There's an hourly psychiatrist. That's going to make it. Point oh nine. Small bit. Almost 30,000 was they can last year's budget as well. I don't know. So little. Is it better spent? Is it ever going to get. My suspicion is that they're not actually filling that 0.09. That what happened is that. Patients come in for therapy. And it's determined that they need psychiatric services, particularly. Someone to monitor prescriptions. And so, you know, I don't know if that's going to be used. Because most of the. I think. Right. Prescriptions. And so maybe someone available. Send a patient to, for that evaluation. Prescription. And then to see that person every three to six months. The evaluated. Yeah. So. Okay. You don't want to ask me why I know that. Yeah, I mean, they may be struggling. Find someone who has capacity. Okay. Okay. I mean, I mean, mental health services. Regardless of ability. Other questions. Yes. So I move that. We have a motion. Yes. So I move that we approve the Arlington youth counseling center budget. 1,519. $1,519,155. $1,573,270. In revenue. Did you say one? One five, one nine or one three, one nine. One. One. Oh, I'm sorry. So there's an ocean. All right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophie. Well, just to follow that. So last year's. Where the town meeting could terminate it. Does that mean we shouldn't have done a lot for this year? Probably. Because otherwise you're going to be saying this every year. Yeah. No, I mean, I could talk to. I could talk to the city council. He's allowed to continue to add. But they will be, you know, in the shoe. No. Right. Then you're right. We talked about it last year. I'm just curious. I mean, I'd forgotten about it too, but yeah. I miss all those. But. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry, what was the last thing that you just feel we're just, oh, the thing that's at the top. Shouldn't you see only Charlie. Just a suggestion I think trying to shoehorn the cancellation of this department in this late date, probably a burden on the budgeting department. Right. It wouldn't be for this year. Forget it.</blockquote>

I had a second. No one. Where are we with the treasurer postage. Not Wednesday but on Monday. Who else will be ready on Monday. No one. Well, let's see where we get on Wednesday. And So, I think we're doing good. And I know that we have some budgets that can't be done, and practically won't be done. End of February. So, if we can get some of these other budgets. All right. So we're having a meeting on Wednesday, and we're having a meeting on Monday. Unless you decide else on Wednesday, but that's. I think we'll have have plans for next Wednesday. So we're not meet. I'd rather not be next Wednesday. And do this Wednesday and Monday. But there are no promises. See what we can do. I was going to mention one sort of announcement for anyone who's interested in the future of Arlington's historical buildings, the town manager. On 14th, on Wednesday at 1 o'clock in the afternoon is giving a talk at the historical society. About Arlington's historical municipal edifices, what's being planned to preserve them. So, if you happen to be available that afternoon. And that's my thought. One o'clock at the historical society. Sounds good. Anyhow. Much to adjourn. All in favor say aye. Aye.</blockquote>
