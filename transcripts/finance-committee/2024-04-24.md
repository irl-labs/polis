<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, minutes. Um, we need to consider a couple of things. One, a very minor language change to vote in article 61 and 63, I think everyone's seen that. Ida, being Ida and very conscientious, talked to the Department of Revenue and they suggested that this language be tweaked to read said sums to be utilized to reduce the tax rate, rather than our vote, which was to be utilized in the termination. So any comment questions on that. Do I have a Do I have a motion to have that reconsider. Yes. All right. We'll do a motion to reconsider article 6163, and then we'll do the motion to amend the language of the vote. So all in favor of motion reconsideration say aye starting with Jordan. Yes. Jennifer. Yes. Yes, Rebecca. Yes, Josh. Yes. Charlie. Yes, john. Yes, Daryl. Yes. Yes. Jones. Yes, Peggy. Yes. Yes. David. All right. Is there a motion to those two votes. All in favor say aye starting with Jordan. Yes. Jennifer. Aye. Caroline. Aye. Josh. Aye. Charlie. Yes, john. Aye. Aye. Annie. Yes. Ellen Jones. Peggy. Aye. Randy. Aye. Yes. Fran. Aye. David. Aye. Seems like people are crunchy. Follow instructions. Some of us are rebels.</blockquote>

<summary>2. Future Meetings</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 491</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want for us to think of discuss whether we want to reconsider is the prudent investor article. Before we talk about that I just want to talk about scheduling so that the rest of this meeting, we can deal with the fruit investor article. So, first of all, expect the default will be, we're going to meet every Monday and Wednesday. Unless you hear from Tara, otherwise, whether we meet next Monday I think will depend on whether we approve the prudent investor warrant article today. If we want to continue the discussion, then we'll do it on Monday. On May 1 minute man's coming in. I just sent the presentation to you Tara. Okay, okay and to the moderator for the. Okay, great. May six has been set aside to do the town budgets and the capital plan town managers getting all his department has in a room. And I just have a confession to make. Okay, the other thing that we're going to do on the six. I expect is the town manager, maybe close to some collective bargaining agreements. So, Jim and Ellen and Alex and I have targeted May 6 as like the drop dead date for agreements. So Alex will get us materials for any agreements that we have the Friday before May 6, and then May 6 when we will be here. And we'll talk about any agreements, and then we will go to ratify. So, so May 6 is an important day. And then on May 8 is the special. There has been talk about doing a trial run of starting time meeting at 730. During the session. If that is the case, then we would be meeting at seven. When I was last in these discussions. The thought was to do that on the eight. And then there was a pushback from the chair of the redevelopment board on that so I don't know where that stands but there's a possibility that one night during town meeting. This time, we'll be meeting at seven but hopefully we'll get a lot of people can arrange their schedules. Lastly, end of the year dinner, I'd like to have some volunteers. And the date I was looking at. And I don't know. I'll just, I'll just throw that out as Monday, June 17, so whoever wants to help organize that dinner. Maybe aim for that. That's maybe not if it's not that maybe something like that. So, I'm going to help but I'm sort of out of the state for the engine. But you're willing to do. Yeah, it can't be at my apartment it's too small. All right. All right, thank you very much. We'll check back with you at some meeting before the end of time and see how the thought process has gone with that. And anyone who wants to help. Just talk to Jennifer and. All right. Any questions about scheduling.</blockquote>

<summary>Article 56 Prudent Investor Rule</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 203</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Lastly, the prudent investor Warren article which is 56. We voted no action because essentially we wanted a new player investment policy for now. The board of selectmen voted favorable action so right now as it stands, we have to competing votes. Since we voted on the prudent investor article I've had discussions with Augusta Haydock who's the chair of the commissioners, Julie Wayman the treasurer. Jim Feeney, and I went for the select board and discussed where the differences are. What has come about is potential compromise, which I think you have that you've got that in any materials that are sent out, essentially, what the select board, what, what the manager would like in the town treasurer is for town meeting to approve the article. But with the understanding that the town manager is going to go through this process before it's implemented, which includes a new investment policy ruled out one in which we would have some say in this creation. So that is the potential compromise. How people feel about whether that satisfies your concerns, our concerns, or whether we still want to see the investment policy included first before the town town meeting approves the one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I didn't see the urgency of this,</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 66</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, but the urgency now is that there's this different folks, and that it's not clear what time any votes on. Since we've, we've had this different vote is that the issue. So right now there's a, there's a vote of favorable action. So that's what time anybody vote on that. So, and then we, and then tell me he has our no action vote right.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 19</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there's no investment so potentially if we continue to vote no action, we lose some power. Not necessarily.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 39</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I still am against this proposal because there's too much at stake and there's not enough work done and there's no reason why they can't go forward with that work without town meeting saying, do some preparation work.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Carolyn White - 106</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They're, you know, town town meeting can say, go do some prep work but we're not approving this family, the warrant doesn't say they can't look into it. It simply says they can go ahead and do it. And so, by us saying, we're concerned about that will let them go do their work, but we're concerned about until we see the work. It says a lot about us, and where we stand on things. You know, usually we give people money when they do their homework, they show up and they've done their homework we give them the money. Nobody's done any homework. I'll stop.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 147</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Carolyn, and, and I don't think it's a question of a power play I think it's a question of what what is our position about what is and is not proven here. There's, they're saying they're going to do this work this process on and so forth, but we can't put it in the bylaw, or the warrant article language that they're going to do that. So, I think that our no action vote is still kind of a warning to town meeting that there's something to discuss here and we'll have the opportunity to present this in some meetings and stories about how they feel in terms of, you know, whether they trust. People know standing up and saying, yeah, they follow this process it will probably satisfy our concerns, but it doesn't really change our vote, because we haven't seen it happen.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 90</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned proceeding with some sort of involvement of the Finance Committee, that'd be as hard as approval by the Finance Committee. Approval of the policy. I don't know I'm trying to remember what we would be involved with extracting revised our policy would be circulate to both the Finance Committee and board for review. Sorry edits the treasurer consultation with the commissioners would finalize policy presentation to the manager. And second question with this compromise be in the form of an amendment to the main motion or substitute motion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think it would be. It would be nebulous fallback is this town manager. Charlie.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 124</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don't see what the rushes. We have another town meeting in the fall or spring, and you have the policy done and we vote for it. Everyone's saying what I would say so I'm not gonna say. Go ahead. Sorry, I just wanted to clarify what I think I didn't articulate well last time, which is that the as the stock market is going up right now there's kind of recency bias, where you're like, oh my god we got to get in we got in. Right, and I worry about that kind of impetus for because this is a long term investment policy for many decades. And so missing a year that may or may not grow does not really matter.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 23</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's exactly what I said yes. That we should be chasing the market. Yeah. Time in the market. There. Yeah. Anybody else Josh.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Josh Lobel - 56</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of the compromise. We're just a select board first and we consider their position. They weren't. They, they, they aren't reconsidering their position. They, it's clear that they were agnostic favorable. They were reissued by the town manager, making commitments that nothing happened until an updated investment policy is better than what's in place.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 100</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody else. It seems surprising that the select board would vote in, in favor. No. managers pushing it. They're not us. Some of them used to be on this committee but they're not anymore. It's surprising I wouldn't have checked the left before they voted. They weren't expecting it right. And at least one member suggested that maybe they should have waited. But they voted and then they found out about our no action vote, and then that's why we asked me to explain. And that's how did that develop the town managers. So repeat the town managers compromise again.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 231</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. As soon as practicable. These policies would be integrated into a single policy so right now we have to to investment policies to be integrated into a single policy that would be updated by the Treasury. and consultation with the Board of Commissioners of Trust Funds and in accordance with the best practices offered by the Massachusetts Collectors and Treasurers Association. The revised draft policy would be circulated to both the Finance Committee and Select Board for review and comment. Following any necessary edits, the Treasurer, again in consultation with the Board of Commissioners of Trust Funds, would finalize the policy for presentation to the Town Manager and Deputy Town Manager Finance Director. Upon adoption of the finalized Investment Policy Statement, the Town would conduct a Chapter 30B procurement for Investment Management Services by a request for proposals at the end of this calendar year. Designees from both the Finance Committee and Select Board would be invited to participate in the selection process and score the various proposals received in connection with the RFP. The Investment Policy Statement would be included with the RFP materials but also transmitted to the chosen Investment Manager upon issuance of a one-year contract with two one-year options to renew. It is only at this point that the change sought by Article 56 would be effectuated for Arlington's Trust Funds, likely in early 2025.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I originally had a question about who would determine as soon as practicable but it sounded later on that there was there was there was sort of a sequence of events defined in the in the compromise so I withdrew my question. Any other questions or comments?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 113</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't suppose they'd be willing to say the Finance Committee instead of review approval. Take out review and put in approval. Would that modify everyone else? I think that takes it out of the hands of the town meeting. So to me, waiting six months, ten months to do this is not the end of the world. The town meeting, as you said, is a serious long-term issue and the town meeting should have the final say. I don't care whether or not we have approval on the policy. There will be a policy and a process for judging whether or not the policy has been followed and the process is appropriate.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 15</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It matters less that you approve. I agree. I don't care about approval as much.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 68</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I'm more interested in the process that there be some sort of public notice for an opportunity for the public to comment because we have people in our town who have expertise in this area who might have an opinion and might offer insight. So I'd like to see that. And public reporting and results and some accountability, which is what we've been missing for so long.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Josh Lobel - 81</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh? This is not my area of expertise, but did you find the policy lacking, the documents that we got? There isn't any. That's the point. There are two. There is one. They just need to be updated. Pretty loose. Different sector. It's not the policy being loose. It's the process. But it's not like there's no investment policy in place right now. No, but they're trying to replace it with a new one, right? And the new one doesn't exist.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 150</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, no, I probably disagree. I think that the whole thing is they want to be able to invest in a wider range of vehicles. But the core things of putting this much in large cap, this much in fixed assets, this much, I think that's likely to kind of stay the same. It's just you're going to have greater options in those categories and they have high and low percentages for each category and stuff like that. I can't imagine that the policy is going to change all that much. So it made it much easier for them to play around, was my recollection of what I know. We're removing the restriction of these 20 equities and these five funds and opening up the whole world. But it's got to be within those parameters that are set in the policy. Not necessarily. We have just a few more minutes.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Annie LaCourt - 200</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie? Just that the thing that some of us remember is that there was a policy and there was a person that started investing. There was no public process and there was no oversight of that person. And that's what I don't see. I want to know how they're going to, the manager of the select board or somebody, they're going to review results. That's the treasurer's job. I think that's in there. I'd like more time to re-read what they said. It was the treasurer's job. The treasurer stood it up. There was nobody in charge of the treasurer. So I want the defined steps the chain of command is going to take to oversee that. We're talking about trust funds. Yes, I get it. And we have the trust fund commissioners and other boards and commissions who are also the second eyes. So the question I have is, is it worthwhile to have any more discussion on this or are we ready to decide whether we want to stick with our stand or not? I move that we vote to stick with our stand, to reaffirm our stand. Carolyn, do you want to make a motion for reconsideration?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 98</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I move that we reconsider. Second. All right. We will take a vote to reconsider 56. All right. Starting with Jordan. Yes. Jennifer? Yeah. So he's not here. Carolyn? Yes. Do you want to reconsider? Sure. What the heck? Rebecca? No. Josh? Yeah. Mike? Charlie? No. John? No. Daryl? No. Jenny? No. Al Jones? No. Peggy? No. Al Toste? Yes. Grant? No. David? No. All in favor of reconsidering? 11. Opposed? That's what I got. All right. So the motion to reconsider fails. All right. So I don't see any need for us to meet on Monday.</blockquote>
