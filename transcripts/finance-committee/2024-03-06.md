<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'm Chris Moore. I'm the chair of the capital planning committee. And we have a slide for the introduction. So we'll do it that way. And my co-chair is going to start off the presentation and then we'll switch among the different member. Okay, so we have the presentation up. Again, I'm already on her device chair on the opening act night. I'm going to start off with a in progress picture of our renovation of the high school, certainly a capital investment, although it is not part of the capital plan to make them project, but still paying for this. This, this new asset effects and constrains town finance. So we wanted to put that up there. Also, it's the favorite example of a capital project happening. Right. Tara next slide please. Okay, here we have a nice agenda. We're asking you to do a little bit on who we are. And what we do on this committee. What capital is. An overview of the major issues that we hired this year, and that we think will be with us for a while. What the capital plan has achieved recently, or is currently achieving. And how it fits into our town budget. Then we'll have some detail on the main sources of funds. And our recommended uses by department. Finally, some specifics on prior borrowing. Appropriations, and then the recommended. Next slide please. We're asking you to vote payroll action on our recommended budget for 25. And the re, appropriation of previously borrowed funds. And also to endorse the 5 year plan, which covers 25. 29 next slide please. Okay, this slide is our member. And how each of us came to capital planning. There's town. Citizens who are appointed by the moderator. There's a vice chair. Daryl hammer from. From income. Sorry. I know, I know. All an MC for net for short. And then we have four time officials on the committee. So, just to give you directions right now. And get Chris. I'm sorry. Alex McGee. The town manager. Joe. You got Cody town controller. The APS. And Joe Solomon. And MC Harmon. We're missing. Julie Wayman is our treasure. She can't be with us tonight. I'm sorry. All right, next slide. All right. So, as you do, we divide up our. Tasks into committees or subcommittees. So you'll see how we have four standing subcommittees and we divide up. The members across them as shown here. So public works, recreation, administration. Finance safety. And then we have a subcommittee. Every fall to go through all their requests. And then we are. We present them to our, to our full committee and discuss them. Next slide, please. Okay. And then just want to deal a little bit into why we do our capital planning approach. These are for long-term assets. Often they're costly assets. So we do a lot of long-term planning. And in doing a plan. Many years, we try to help reduce uncertainty. Also try to weigh the different priorities from all different stakeholders. In order to keep in our budget. And having this dedicated group. To this. We hope. Helps to reassure our citizens and our county members. Next slide, please. So our process, I think that you've all seen this before. There may be one or two new members, but here's a refresher. We look at the towns year by year. I did revenue. And we allocate 5% for capital. Finishes. And this is for the non exempt spending. We don't count the exempt portion. What's exempt. That's the part that is. Included in exclusion votes. And then. We have a separate pool of money raised. Like extra taxes for a specific. And finite length project. So back to the. I've done a portion of the budget. We asked the town. Departments. When the year began in the summer. You tell us about the request for the next fiscal year. And also for their look. Forward to the next four years beyond that. And then. The next year. We use a committee. We split up into our subcommittees and all the different departments. That's when we request in detail. We also talk to facilities. We talked about the physical plant. We have. And then we approve or not. And we prioritize. Looking to balance spending. Getting within the 5% rule. We've been doing this. And we've been able to adhere to the 5% rule. With the occasional debt exclusion. To meet the debt. The town's needs and also having the 5% rule. Able to keep us. Within guardrails, not spending. But also not trying to overburden the town with. 5% has worked for the last. 30 plus years. And it is very much in line with what we see. So. I think that's it. I hope that you can count. I'll pause here for any questions before I turn it over to Chris. All right. All right. So. Next slide. What is capital? The committee has a specific definition, which might be a little different from what you've seen in other programs. Capital is either purchased in a program. For $23,000. Or is purchased in a program to gradually. Purchase a set of identical or nearly identical items for $25,000. Or more. You might think these. On the low end. They've been this way for quite a long time. We're also looking at. Eventually making some changes there, but this is what we have. For this year. And then we're also looking at. Potentially lengthening its life. By say, replacing the roof on a school. Something more than just kind of ordinary. Next slide. So some examples. A new roof, like I just said, electric wiring. New floor. Plumbing. Strengthening a wall by adding structural elements to it. Interior painting is one of our canonical examples of something that can be done. But it's not. It's not. So expenditures make it into the capital plan when they are for. Capital improvement. So an improvement to a capital asset. For the purchase or lease of a capital asset. Or for a study. Or plan in preparation for the purchase or lease of a capital asset. Everything else should go into the operating plan. So we're looking at a couple of things that have been kind of lurking in the capital plan for a while. That aren't really capital. And we're slowly. Pushing them out into the operating budget as the operating budget has room to absorb them. Next slide. So we'll try this. To use the right words here. I'm one of the people who fail sometimes. But to distinguish between the capital budget for FYI, 25, which is the thing that we're asking you to approve. And it will go to town meeting. And then the capital plan. Which is guests. Things will change for sure. But we want to know that. You know, the big blocks are in place and that we're not looking at some, you know, terrible shortfall. So we go through the process of doing this plan. But we know that things will move around. Possible change. Et cetera. So. We don't worry about whether we hit the 5%. We only worry about it over the course of the whole plan. Because in the past, we found that the process of moving things around to balance it year to year was sort of a silly exercise. And yeah. Meeting votes to approve the plan. Get it wrong. So there are a couple of things that. That we're looking at. And we're looking at. You know, how we're going to balance it year to year. Another one, which is completely new this year. Most of the it projects these days are cloud-based, which means their expenses should be operating. However, when something needs to move from say one cloud service to another cloud service, there's often an overlap. And we've agreed as a committee to fund that expense in the overlap year only. As a way to make it more. Efficient. Can you give me an example? An example would be let's say. Pick one. I was going to say the word. One of the things that's in the budget we'll see for this year is changing the. Agendas and minutes. Software that the time you use on the time website to post all of our services. And we're going to have to transfer it to the company that runs it. So we're going to have to transfer to something else. And in the overlap year, we'll probably end up paying. For two services. As we make that happen. And so capital is agreeing to pay for that one year of one of the services. Licensing. Transitional costs. Or just licensing. Both. For an expectation that there are. I don't know. It's like a transitional cost. We'll get from the old system. That first year. As the new system is. You know, It's ironing itself out. Yeah. So. We're trying to avoid disrupting the operating budget and make it easier for the town to make those kinds of shifts. All right, next slide. So. We're going to have. $10.4 million. For capital before offsets. So there are going to be some offsets that related to other sources of money, for instance, enterprise funds. And 10.3 million net after offsets. For the last several years, the capital plans felt pretty tight by which we mean that there's more stuff that seems like it's worth doing, then we can actually pay for. The capital projects. And that's a lot of money. It's a lot of labor for building things. So capital projects can be. More expensive every time you turn around. Even some projects where we thought we had enough money in last year's capital budget, and then put it out to bed and books. We need some more. So a few things like that have happened. There's a lot of long-term cost uncertainty in the market. How much will a fire engine cost you in five years? Really hard to guess. So, you know, It's just a plan we can adjust as we, as we move along. We're also, we have a lot of aging facilities in town. And we're trying to do a good job on maintaining and also upgrading them as we go. And borrowing costs are up. Which is great for everyone who's collecting interest and not so good for the town. So we have to take multiple approaches to bring the plan into balance. And we're trying to do that. Some of the notable ones here are that. Awesome. Oh, sorry. It's a lurking capital expense. The plan is eventually to do some sort of rebuild there. But that plan has not really been flushed out since we're still finishing up the high school. We're avoiding spending. We're not going to be able to do that right now. Because that's not happening. Eventually presumably that isn't project will be exempt. Project. But remains to be seen what that really looks like. As I've said before, we were pushing operating expenses off as much as we can into the operating budget. So that's cloud IT services. Schools have some proposals for sort of. The. The extra piles kind of on an ad hoc basis where they were needed that struck the committee is really an operating sort of expense. So. Library asked for some painting and carpet replacement. Those are sort of our canonical examples of things that are capital. So we didn't do those. And the police. One of the updates on flashlights. But tons, which also. So those are some examples of things that were requested that the committee did not. Because they weren't capital. Once we got the list of sort of everything that seems to be capital. We ranked them all. Each person went through a ranking exercise with. And then we looked at what the committee as whole came out with. And that caused us to make some scope reduction. We reduced funding for school front office renovations. So you'll see some more detail on those renovations when we get to the schools. There was a, an idea to expand. Dog park. Which we removed. Robin's library. And work on the entrance, including the front doors. And the masonry surrounding the entrance. Which we did accept. There was a proposal to put in a snowmelt system. That cost me nearly 400 K. And we decided it wasn't. Blue bikes. So. We'll go back to some ongoing program. They had some out your requests for. Expansion new stations with more invites in them. They have current funding from grants and other places. And the committee decided to remove that future funding. Waiting to see how it works. You know, does the expansion of the system. And the new contract, which is anticipated next year. So that's one. Another one. Is. From the schools. Addison made a request to move to a one-to-one device program. We currently have a bring your own device. Optional program. And I guess there's some. You shouldn't. I just want to say. They come from that program. And so they wanted to move to a one-to-one device program. The cost of that was roughly a hundred. And so the committee's decided not to fund that. It's capital. But we thought it wasn't necessarily a great thing to sign up for. Similarly, the age S one-to-one device program was initially funded by. Building. Through the funding for the building. And they were looking to move that onto the capital plan. About a hundred. And we also decided not to accept that. So that's one of the things that schools will just have to find other funding. Any questions on all that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. You just mentioned. I see. In the budget. For Arlington high school. Yeah. It's a phase out. We decided to phase them out over time. We didn't cut them off. Right. Good point. So. We did do. Renovations in schools. They're not very. Oh. Can I put that question on? Thank you. All right.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 1747</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. So I'm just going to speak to. I'm going to talk a little bit about what we've done. In the library, the Robins library. There's been a new lighting system. Just sort of. Utility bills by about 40%. It's been a nice wind. I was also a new building management system is placed there to help manage that new lighting system. We have. We're going to do a study, which sort of is. Can act as a bit of a roadmap on electrifying buildings. We have money on the books right now, but we're going to wait on spinning that until a few more things come into focus. But we're going to meet our. What the vacation goals. To start getting serious about. Figuring out a roadmap. And we're going to do that. We're going to do that. Through the traditional capital plan. That's likely going to be an issue at some point in the future. The new. W building building. Which is like sort of the main building. Now open and functioning. This has sort of the main VW. Group of employees facilities and sections are all over there. And then buildings. So. We have a lot of work underway right now. Part of that project. The anticipation is. Closing that project out. Hopefully this year. So more to be said later on on this. Community center elevator and HVAC. Those projects are ongoing right now. Number of playground upgrades that occurred. Funded sort of by various funding mechanisms. So. Lucas system and that's an automated chest compression system. Which. Fire department is very. Really enjoys being able to add it sort of saves people facts from doing really vigorous CPR. They had actually a life save. Using this tool in December. December, which is really great to hear. So. We're still having difficulty getting all of the vehicles we want exactly. On time. That seems to be that log jam seems to be sort of. Releasing a little bit. And so. We anticipate being able to purchase everything that's funded in the current year, this year. Over the last few years, we've had difficulty getting all of the vehicles that we needed. In the plan for next year, So we're still having difficulty getting all of the vehicles that we need. across nine sort of different vehicles within various operations. School and Cal90 projects are ongoing. Minutes and agendas is something that we're looking to redo. We have to replace our GIS system which is aging as we're moving forward on. So that's just all we're always marching forward with new technology. Capital plan, some projects that are currently underway right now. Woodville Robbins, our construction water and sewer improvements and roadways and sidewalks. Almost to our spring sort of our roadway construction season. So we'll be able to start opening up roads soon once the cross is no longer an issue. Robbins library bathrooms, those are not really our capital project but they are our capital project. The town has a CPA funded project. Yeah so DPW campus working towards it. The Missick Street bridge is finally going out to bid in the next month or so. And the high school as we all know phases one and two are now complete. We're on to phase three which is the athletic building and then phase four will be fields in FY20 and calendar year 25. Okay that was a lot. Next slide. So how the budget is formed for our capital plan. Chris touched on this a little bit. What we do is we take our long-range plan which really guides a lot of our budgeting principles in town and we take sort of as a point in time, breathe it, that is a dynamic document that changes as more information sort of comes to light. So we take a snapshot of that. This year our pro forma number was 221 million dollars. We adjust for exempt debt service which is 12.5 million. We adjust for all of our enterprise offsets which include water and sewer and that brings us to 205 million dollar budget and five percent of that is how we determine what our budget's doing. Next slide please. You can see that sort of play out here. It's probably very difficult to see from where all of you are sitting but the sort of fifth line down the percept total is 12.4 million dollars. We have a whole section in red. This builds a number of different things that we sort of exclude from that five percent number. These are various different kinds of offsets that we calculate and sort of pull the plan harmless from. So for example we have antenna funds which we get certain dollars from AT&T and T-Mobile from a couple of antennas that we have around town. We contribute those towards the plan. Same thing for any override money that's been promised to specific projects in the past. So in the 2011, 2019 and most recent 2023 overrides those all had specific promises made so those are held outside of our five percent number. Our debt service for our ambulance. We pay specific projects down with our ambulance revenues. We keep that outside of the five percent number and so really what this does it brings us down to a number that we as a committee aim for to get into exact balance at five percent for our total budget. We achieve that to within 24 dollars in the black which is a quick way the achievement feels like and then we balance it over the five years also. So yeah all right next slide please. Capital funding sources. The two main funding sources that we use are cash and bonding. Cash is just money that is entirely comes out of our sort of our unallocated funding. We just decide to pay for something up front. We're not going to borrow for it. Bonded is anything typically that costs over a hundred thousand dollars. There are certain items that you cannot borrow for and then we have to follow state law and we interface whenever we anticipate bond something with our bond council on whether or not we are eligible to borrow for that item or project and for the borrowing duration that we plan for. All of the borrowing durations are then baked into our capital plan and that informs our out years debt services. And then we have another funding source category called other. These are things like grants, chapter 90, user fees. So just sort of your other different smaller pots of money that we cobble together to make significant. Next slide please. All right so ARPA funded projects. Our ARPA spending strategy it really went into effect a couple years ago. We took two one-time five million dollar revenue offsets. So that was just money that came into the town's coffers to the two and ten million total dollars that left about 25 million dollars to be spent on ARPA eligible projects over the ensuing roughly four years. All of our ARPA money needs to be tied up and contracted. So it needs to be what the feds are calling encumbered basically by the end of FY by the end of calendar 2024. So this you know late winter and into early spring we'll be making a big push at sort of so out of the town manager's office and the select the benefit of the select board to determine what sort of the the rest of the runway for our spending is going to look like. I'm not going to make any huge wholesale changes to the plan that's been in place for years but we do have some money that can be sort of swept into other projects and sort of reprioritized. So that money is coming through that plan coming. So we're not promising any major ARPA funding into this year's capital. I am going to turn it back over to team right now. Next slide please. Okay so it's one more slide for me here at the high level we're going to give you a summary of what the acquisition expense is going to be for the FY 25 budget and that's 16.1 million dollars. That's different from the five percent number that you saw before. This is the out of pocket cost this year. So it doesn't have debt service from bonds that we are newly issuing this year. Sorry the five percent number you saw before it doesn't have that service from what you saw from any new bonds that we're issuing this year. It does have debt service that we've incurred from prior borrowing. This number doesn't have this is we're paying out of pocket this year. It's going to be a portion that comes out of cash, a portion that we issue bonds for, pay for it now, and then we pay the bond bills later. And it has the portion that's coming from other funds and we talked about other a minute ago. So this is how it breaks out again 16.1 million dollars at the bottom comes out of 16 sorry 6.5 million of bond. It's under 5 million of cash and 4.6 million dollars of other almost all of the other is in public works. You'll see that public works and schools together are about 80 plus of capital budget. And we wanted to give you a sense of what the breakout was here but also to understand how we then ordered the rest of our presentation. We've done them in ascending order from largest to smallest. So you'll see public works coming up next as we dive into the department by department parts of the presentation. One last thing I want to mention before we go on to the next slide is that we tried to emphasize that we're asking you to vote on and have me to vote on the FY25 capital budget. And so whenever we show numbers for what's being spent in public works or schools or what have you, we try to be consistent about having them shown in black if they're FY25 to draw attention to them and during the out years we have a new break. So focusing on what's actually in the budget for FY25. And before we move on to the individual pieces, any questions about sort of the big overview?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Annie LaCourt - 171</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to be sure I understand this. Yep. Okay so the other that's like grant funding not coming out of the budget. Correct. The $4,952,000 cash is coming out of this year's budget and then the bond. Coming out of the FY25 budget. FY25. Yes. I'm already in that. You're already there. You've been in that since June. I'm still in FY20. Okay the bond amount is we're going to bond that amount of money and that's going to add something to the debt service. That'll show up next year when we go back to page 16 in the presentation. That'll show up in that prior non-exempt debt service not next year. Yes. Whatever we're paying on that. It actually shows up in its own line called new non-exempt debt services right below prior. Excellent. Yes. I have to tell you it has taken me 20 years to come to membership to be able to tell you that that's how this works. So I just have to do it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Miss LaPorte. Yeah it's basically the bond is what we're paying for with the credit card. And then we pay the credit card bill next year. Yep. And all past credit card bills next year. Yep. And future. Yes and future years about our budget for this year. It's this year's credit card bill.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie. The other bill in public works is water and sewage. Sorry? How much? 2.9 million dollars. The three three million of the four and a half is water and sewage. Correct. And the rest is like roads chapter 90.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 50</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah there's about three quarters of a million that is chapter 90. There's a portion that is from a department of environmental protection grant that will come to that in a few slides. And that's the lion's share of it right there. Thank you. John do you have a question?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Griffin - 39</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. The breakout of the I guess the other the 4.6 million um is that does that go through the uh the EPW's budget? Is that why it's on there? I'm just wondering why that's carved out of this.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 91</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah the other is so water and sewer is almost fully excluded from this plan. Um in a way we show it there as a capital number but water and sewer um like they're they're 20 plus million dollar budget is not included in our pro forma budget the 220s. Um and their debt service is not included in our debt service numbers. That lives almost exclusively within that enterprise. Got it. So it's like capital capital expenditures of the town but not necessarily written from this budget. Correct. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somebody just to be clear am I reading this right and next year you're not getting some credit card at all? Is that why the new debt service is zero?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 53</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New debt service is zero because we don't issue the bonds until uh December this year. Right. And our payment doesn't come due until after the end of this year. Right. We did what's called a long first coupon. We're not going to be making uh any new debt service payments this year.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 90</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so I can just sort of look at the new debt service sort of shift to the left of the space or is that true every year? Every year. Every year. Yeah. Okay. Uh so I appreciate the um the move to move things that are not capital to budget budgets and you mentioned that there's still some things that hadn't been moved. Would that piggy on anything? Could you give me sort of a big picture about how much you think is still not quite a capital expense?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did a look at that you know right it was very little actually still very much. Okay so it's not about $15,000. Yes it was in like the five figures so not much at all. Yeah okay. We're almost there. Yeah it's small and it's really difficult to absorb things into the operating budget. Yeah. So it's just the type of thing. Sure. Other questions so far? You know turning over to uh our secretary Joe Solomon to talk about how it works.</blockquote>

<summary>DPW Facility Build</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Joe Solomon - 130</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah so the first slide here is the DPW new facility. As Alex mentioned phase one of new buildings largely complete at this point. It's occupied by many departments. The goal is to have the project wrapped up by later this year. The work is moving into older buildings which is you know focused on the storage IT offices. There's some site work around the buildings and to date the project is at its current budget of a little over $46 million. As the work gets into older buildings there is some expectation of minor additional costs but there's no additional ask for money in the capital budget because that will be offset by essentially operating surplus that they have from unfilled attempts. So any questions on that project? Charlie?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charlie Foskett - 32</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes thank you. Isn't this a design build construction company at risk project? Yeah it's a construction management at risk project. So why are we funding their overruns through the operating budget?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Joe Solomon and Charlie Foskett - 529</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well we're funding the overrun because of sort of unforeseen site conditions which are basically the only reason why construction management at risk contracts can't grow. If the duration of the project goes longer due to site conditions which essentially seems to happen almost all the time. It doesn't always happen but if it does happen a lot then your bottom line price tag goes up. They got a $10 million increase in this project cost long after they were in the project. So they knew the site condition. Yeah they're discovering new things. It's very questionable yeah but we're likely to be able to keep it within the sort of without having to come back for any new money. Why do we sign a contract like that and not enforce it and then we're saying that we have excesses in the surpluses in the operating budget. We don't have surpluses in the operating budget. We're not giving services to some of the citizens. I mean we have surpluses in the DPW operating budget. It's coming from services not being delivered or being delayed. I'm not entirely sure how to answer that. We are enforcing the contract fully. I don't want to take up a lot of time but isn't there a conflict between funding the overruns out of the operating budget and enforcing the contract that have to be the responsibility of the contract? Yeah it is their responsibility. There's a town building committee that is sort of managing this project. We're managing it as best as possible. The CMO risk contract is being enforced as best as we can. We're not just handing over money. If we have to get the project done as quickly as we can we can't afford to have any cost overruns that we have to pay for. Can you tell me why we have to pay for them? That's what I'm trying to understand. Yeah because we find dirty dirt underground and we find problems within the walls. Are those things specifically excluded to the contract? No. Then I'm at a loss about how we're managing this project. I didn't mean the RRs. Yes, excuse me. So cost increases that are due to unseen site and that's like the one out for the at-risk part. Correct yeah. Oh it is excluded. It is, I'm sorry. And how much money are you talking about? I think, I don't know, the pendulum seems to swing weakly where we it's not like we're over by, if I had to place a best guess I'd say in the low to mid six figures. We've luckily had a really light winter. We're likely to be able to fund this even out of snow and ice. But yeah it's, who knows, like last week we were 20,000 in the black. So you don't know until you're really working on these things. We get updates weekly from our construction manager and when we have a big overrun we are usually able to negotiate that down to sort of reduce our risk, reduce their risk really, and pay sort of a lower cost to move forward, if that makes sense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So questions, Carolyn, Annie, and Sharon. I'm a little confused why dirty dirt underneath the building was not taken into consideration before we signed a contract with them because we knew darn well that we had gas tanks under there that were there way before the current requirements and that the fact that they would likely be leaking was extremely high, not to mention the fact that it's on the site where the old gas loop was. So are you telling me we set up a contract where we didn't factor that in beforehand? No, it was factored in and test pits were done as part of the project, but I think that it's coming back worse than anticipated. It doesn't take much for it to get really bad. Annie, so let me see if I can understand this in the terms in my world. You signed a contract with a certain scope. That scope included every risk and contingency that you could identify in conjunction with the construction manager who was going to take every opportunity to add to that scope. Everything I felt they could possibly run into because they were going to be at risk. You signed that contract and what we're discovering now are things that are legitimately outside of the scope that was agreed upon in the contract. Right, basically, I mean, yeah, you know, you can say it that way. It's like the scope remained roughly the same, but it changes over time when you discover new conditions that you have to deal with. Right, so sort of giving you an example from my world, you know, the client says, we only need to move a hundred fields from this object to that object, and we only need to migrate a thousand records of data, and then you wake up the next morning, and suddenly it's 5,000 records that you've found. And now you have to go back to the client and say, your scope doesn't cover that. You've got to either add, or you have to not move as much data, or give you other examples. You didn't agree to build that form. We're not going to do it unless you add a new scope. Oh, but it was implied by, no, there's no replication. You've got two forms listed in there. I think the other thing to think about is if you ask a contractor to take on all of the risk, then they price that completely into their bid. Do you want to be paying the full amount regardless? So there's sort of this point of, you know, hopefully ideal point, but maybe not, where you sort of say, okay, we've asked you to take on a lot of risk, but if it's beyond that, then we have to sort of share in the risk, because otherwise you're going to charge me, you know, a lot more, not just a little bit more to accept that sort of low probability, but still non-zero. Right, because this is the fixed fee problem. If you tell me I have to work on a fixed fee, I'm going to double my fee. If you tell me I consume time and materials, you're taking on the risk that it takes longer than it is. Especially if there are a lot of unknowns. Yeah, there's always a lot of unknowns. And you don't want to price the 5,000 records in if your testing shows you that reasonably, you can say, I only have 200. You, the client, don't. I, the consultant, would love to price the 5,000 records. I'll write it in and give it to the client if you don't want to sign up for $5,000. I remember everybody's motivations. Yes. All right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, Al Toxley and then Al Jones. Okay, this project was under the jurisdiction of the Permanent Child Building Committee, is that correct? Correct. Okay. The chairman of the Permanent Child Building Committee came before town meeting with almost tears in his eyes, telling me about all the problems they're having with the town hall project past town meeting, past the spring. So it sounds like what you're saying here is that we won't have to come back for this project. That's the town meeting, yeah. Right. Hold you to that. Al Jones. Thank you. Hello, Dr. Construction Manager of Real Estate. I assume that is a more expensive contract than just time and materials, sort of thing. Yeah, is there any, I don't expect an answer right now, but is there any way to say, okay, we paid this premium to get a construction manager a risk and this is how much was put into that to say, in other words, to say, is it worth it? Can we retroactively look and see what the insurance policy cost us and how much that saved? So was it a better deal or going forward, we should not do that anymore because it would be cheaper to sell the tree, essentially. Yeah. I mean, it's sort of like my husband, the insurance guy says, well, okay, but it didn't come to the roof. Yeah, we can do a look back. We're locked into this. The CM at risk sort of model for these big projects is when you have a lot of unknown, you try to typically go with the CM at risk and it's more of a, when you have more unknowns, you use it. When you have less unknown, you can go up like a design, traditional design is build project. Right. So we had a lot of unknown. Well, yeah, given where the, given those very old building where it was located, what was there, all these things that we've discussed right now that caused cost overruns. We had gone with the design, design did build like a more traditional build. I don't know what the cost would have been, but I would imagine we'd be right in the ballpark of it, but I don't know. It was like Carolyn pointed out, everybody knew it was really polluted. So yeah, these are not stupid people. I guess I would, if it was possible at some point, do a look back because going forward, there are a lot of cases where we've decided to self-insure, cheaper, feel like a form of insurance. Right, yeah. I think it's probably a lot of money in doing that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Charlie and then Sophie. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a question about what was just said here in this presentation about this building. I thought I heard you say that it's just about used up the $46.5 million budget. And then I also thought I heard you say that we're now starting to move into two more buildings. Are those two buildings gonna cost us nothing? No, we haven't. We are on budget. We haven't expended all of the budget. How much of the budget has not been expended? I think we have to get back to you. I don't know. I can send you a report. Thank you. Okay. So what I am curious about is this idea of finding the money in the operational budget savings. So those are the budgets we review. So are you making decisions in the operations of not filling vacant positions or not doing things? And that's in the idea of keeping some money for this or? No, I mean, we would always love to have all of our positions filled. We have a huge need. It's just extremely difficult to hire, especially for our DBW positions right now. Some of our very lower paying positions, it's impossible to find somebody with a CDL that'll work for 25 bucks an hour. It's like really hard for us. So finding labor. So at what point do you ask to increase those and actually fill them and then not have the money for something like this? I mean, it seems like a tail wagging the dog or whatever. I don't know which. Yeah. It's very complicated. These are all collectively bargained positions. It's a lot more difficult than just sort of like saying, we're gonna add five bucks to each position because we don't have the money to do it. And at what point do you just, how long until you say when we can't fill the positions, we haven't filled them the next number of years, we'll take it out of the budget? Like, so you're talking about like reducing like sort of headcounts? Right. I mean, but then you don't have the money for this. I'm just wondering at what point do those just stay as we know we'll never hire? The thing is, is like the sort of the vacancies for excess snow and ice, those are not things that you plan to have, right? There are things that like they become a funding source because they exist, not by sort of design. It would be fantastic if we could have an entire workforce because then we'd be doing all the work that we need to be doing instead of falling behind. And so where would you get the money? If you were at capacity, you weren't using- Right, if we were at capacity, yeah, if we were at capacity, then we would have to find money elsewhere from a reserve fund transfer or town meeting. I mean, we'd have to find the money. It's not, or we'd have to, you know, cut scope. We'd have to not do one of those buildings in the project. Or snow and ice, exactly, yes. Some of the money went from 24 unused funds though, right? Like the 24 unused snow and ice. The name of it was not- Yes, that's where it comes from, the current year of snow and ice. It's this year's snow and ice, the closest. Right, I mean, that's an obvious, right, yeah. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topher and then Jennifer and then Dean. Thank you, Bob, Jen. So I was curious on the things about, we knew it was dirt, right? We knew it was dirt. How do you measure that it's more dirty than the contract? I was not even thinking about it. Like during the project? Yeah, like when they say, well, you know, you have over, you know, this is outside the scope. I mean, you knew it was a toxic waste dump, so. Right. To be honest, it's outside of my sort of sphere of knowledge, you know, experts, expert contractors come in and they tell you. Okay, so it's like part of some part of it. I'm just curious. I think to Annie's point, we could say there's a million square yards of dirt. Should we pay upfront to remove a million square yards of dirt or, you know, and we're just like, is it part of a million or some sort? So no, we did a test pit and then it was like more polluted or is it more, and maybe it's just more dirt. I mean, there's a whole field of licensed side professionals who do this kind of work and they, it's a very standard process. So I don't think, I doubt that there's something going on because it's like a pretty well defined process of how you look at it. And you just get a third party. Yeah, third party expert determination.</blockquote>

Yes, so just having, I just posted this, sorry, but just to give you a sense of the scope, we have about 600,000 of extra money into your new budget because of vacancies. But to your sort of questioning about this, having looked at these budgets for a while, it's not always just an admission. With maybe one exception, three times or so. But you'll see, you know, even from where the budget is published here and then what's going on today, there'll be new vacancies in a different position and then a position that was vacant here has been filled. So, you know, so just sort of cutting one out wouldn't probably get what we need. The only exception is three times. I think I, which always seems to have a vacancy for some reason, but everyone would love to fill it. So, yeah. Yeah, I have other questions, but they're not relevant.</blockquote>

Because, well, look, here's the good news. This is the first time you've been over budget in the last four years of this project, right? It's the fourth time overall. Like you asked for $9 million the last time and we heard all sorts of things and we were told that this wasn't gonna happen again. Now we're back. And so, for me, it's an incredibly frustrating thing. Like, I mean, I struggle because we're all neighborly and friendly friends here. So, like I have every note I can pull up in front of me and I really struggle because I don't want to just read them, right? It's what we said every time, right? And, you know, we went to a special town meeting to deal with this. October of 20 was a special. November of 20 was a special, 2020. It's like, this isn't a reflection. Like, this is not a good book. It's just not. It's like, it's a bad book with one project which was originally a budget. Project that was originally $29.9 million is where it is now. Like, that's really, like, and what frustrates me the most, we talked about this over Zoom in 2020, which was, you know, every time these projects go up, something else gets cut, right? So, you look at like, you look at a park budget and you look at, you know, rehabbing a playground or something and things get cut because this sinkhole is widening. It's very frustrating to me. Like, okay, here we go again, WER. You know, I'm not gonna ask you. I learned not to ask if this is gonna happen again because I don't want to know. It sucks. So, that's why I can't articulate anything else but saying this sucks. It's very sad.</blockquote>

So, they're just not really expensive plans. They're not developed yet. I mean, we can't ask for something we don't know about yet. Okay, thank you, but it is being thought about. Yes, definitely. I mean, we have operations that are continuing here every day. Swap ship, right? Yeah, plus, I mean, there are vehicles that operate in and out of there every day, so it's an average site.

So, these issues, you know, while this is a good opportunity, especially for me to vent frustration, it's not their problem. They've been doing their job. However, I think it would be appropriate, and I don't know how the Chair would consider doing this, but I think we should ask for a complete and detailed report, financial report, on the status of this project and how it got to this point, because I'm not happy with the fact that we're clearly behind in our funding or somehow misrepresenting the funds of the operating side of the DPW budget in order to fund the overruns on this capital project, and I think that's a town management problem, and we need to get to the bottom of it.

We'll get to that soon, but yes, it's connected to all the main things that are falling apart at town hall, but the whole roof is one of the primary recipients of that money short-term. Department heads put together their wishlists and the requests come up and eventually are judged and graded, and did anybody in the last couple of years say, hey, I think the town hall roof is leaking? Town hall has been programmed for about $75,000 in small capital repairs every year for quite a while. Even though we have studies about what needs to be done to the envelope of the building, they'll show there's a lot of need there. It's just not something that has been proposed for an actual project yet. So it's piecemeal stuff, bathrooms here and there, dealing with the clock tower, things like that. Yeah, this last year it went from piecemeal to, oh my God, new tarps and- Yeah, yeah. The ceiling below is collapsing.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 177</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, cool. The next slide. Another area we talked about is roads and sidewalks. Over the coming five years, there's an average of just over $2 million per year for roadways. The last study we have is from 2019 that recommends that level of spend to maintain the current quality at an 80 out of 100 score. Obviously, there's been some inflation since then. The next report will be prepared in time for the next capital cycle to give us a new target, which we can use in our planning. One of the larger roadway projects that's coming up, and it's not all roadway funding, but about $550,000 to address Park Avenue as a corridor. In FY25, a large majority of that is engineering and design work. And specific to roadways, there's $175,000 of that $2 million per year average roadway money for roadway construction work. In the out years, there's additional funding to support this, and it will transition away from design and more into construction work. Any questions on that before I go to sidewalks?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?0 - 174</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Putting it politely, I think the condition of our roads in Arlington has degraded considerably over the last five to eight years. And that may be because of cost escalation, maybe because the infrastructure, people like National Grid or whoever digs up the streets doesn't prepare them correctly. But I think we're giving Belmont a good run for the money under that road. And well, it's a serious problem. And I think strategically, one of the things we have to consider here is we put hundreds of millions of dollars into our school infrastructure, and we've neglected streets and sidewalks. And somehow that imbalance needs to be considered. And I've been behind some of those hundreds of millions of the school site. So I'm not trying to say that. My hands are closed, but the situation that we have with the roads is getting serious. It is serious, but it's getting worse. So, I don't know how the Capital Planning Committee thinks it's going to address that, or if you have addressed it.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee - 332</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, the approaches on a five-year cycle, a town hires a consultant who goes out and creates a PCI score. So, for roadway segments, they'll determine where it is. And then, as an asset, a roadway, in terms of the replacement and repair costs, it doesn't degrade linearly. If you take care of it with sort of lighter treatments more regularly, the quality of the road can be maintained. So, your score will be maintained at a more acceptable level. If you wholly neglect the road, it starts to really accelerate down a curve, where the work required to repair the road becomes, I need to dig up the whole thing and rebuild it again. So, you're talking about, you know, $1 to $2 per yard going up to, you know, $20 to $30, right? Very serious difference. What the town does is they take the report that's done every five years. They take that data, they put it into a program, and the program gives them, based on the town saying, I have X dollars. It says, here's where you need to make repairs to minimize the degradation of the system as a whole. So, our approach has been, and this is sort of the first cycle through it, is to get that data, to understand what the report says, and it says to maintain spend X and try to get close to that so that we stay away from that other end of the cost curve, where this just spirals and becomes untenable in terms of costs to repair. And in terms of what we've done on a capital plan in the last three years or so, is we've been notching up the total amount that they will spend on both roadways and sidewalks. I realize that. So, we are now at the point where we're essentially meeting the goal offered to us five years ago. Better than we were, still not probably where we need to be.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee and Others - 329</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a unique problem that Arlington faces. It's sort of maybe a discussion for another time about how much does it cost to maintain a road system, and is it something that a municipality should take on? Should the state maybe provide more Chapter 90 funding? When I was in my first year trying to learn about this, I searched Chapter 90 funding and road condition. Every town is going to the state saying, you don't give me enough to maintain my roads. It may not be a problem that is going to be solved at a capital funding level, but I don't think we want to let it get away from ourselves. So, we're trying to get close and trying to make sure we maintain it as best as possible. To get from a 79 or 78 to an 80, we needed to spend an extra quarter million dollars per year. So, to be B-minus students, essentially, we would be giving up two police cars every year, forever. It's a lot of money to just maintain it. So, when National Grid comes and clears up the roads for gas stations, and they patch it, who's responsible for really fixing it at that point? Once they're done with everything in the major, do they come back and repave it? Yeah, they come back and repave it, depending on when it is. Depending on when it is, they do a temporary or permanent. But they eventually get to a permanent? They eventually get to a permanent. It's on them. Right. Yes. It's on us to inspect and finish that. Right. Don't we also limit their ability to dig up roads when we freshly? Right. If there's something that's been freshly paved, unless it's an emergency, we won't sign off on it. We try to find efficiencies where, if a road's open, that we're doing other stuff. It's easier said than done, though, the line that kind of thing.</blockquote>

The data here is from 2015, a little bit older, but it just looked at the entire system and said, at this point in time, you've got about a $26 million backlog of work to address quite a variety of deficiencies. And again, this isn't, the backlog doesn't get you to perfect, it gets you to the point where really your sidewalks are fair plus, fair, good, excellent. And as Alex mentioned earlier, there was a recent override geared toward mobility improvements, $200,000 per year. What we do is we carry that $200,000, and then each year that goes up by 2.5% in perpetuity. And there's a few examples of some of the FY25 projects that will be supported by that.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, it would come out. You're saying at this point, this is a huge backlog. This sounds like this is funding, maintaining what we have, not necessarily. Sidewalks don't really degrade aggressively. What DPW has said is they use sort of a few layers of data looking at, you know, areas that tend to have higher pedestrian traffic, areas that tend to come up on equity surveys. They use data to find hotspots where they need to increase the quality or maintain sidewalk infrastructure, and that guides their spending of this budget year. I do see something in sidewalks. I see 50% of all sidewalks are in fair conditions. Yeah, this is at the discretion of DPW. Yeah, but it is driven by a data-driven program. There's also dealing with accessibility issues, because that's like their number one priority is adding or upgrading ramps or corners. Now, you're talking about the little yellow? Yeah, yeah. Are there technical funds for that as well? We use CDBG funds for that, too, but yeah, it's not enough. I mean, eventually they'll get them all, but then the accessibility chain, yeah, there's change.</blockquote>

So the sidewalk and street money that are listed here, does that include Chapter 90 money or does Chapter 90 money sit on top of this? It includes it. It includes it, okay. Then I'm also really excited about the flashing beacons at the Robbins Library. I'm also really excited about something that DPW has been doing in their operating expense, which is something that English has done for years, which is sidewalk shaving. So that when you see, you know, there's a sidewalk that's off here, they shave off the top, so it's not as much of an inconvenience. I feel like we're making some good progress. The concrete, yeah.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, so a sidewalk, when I read the 2015 report, really, it's things like tree roots, which will actually physically destroy the sidewalk. Other than that, once you put a concrete sidewalk in, if you mix the concrete and pour it the right way, you're good for a while. When I talked about the roads and how they degrade and get to that, that isn't the characteristic that you see in the sidewalk. That saying, like $26.1 million backlog at a million dollars a year, none of us are going to be sitting here doing this when we solve the problem. Similar to, oh, my God, the road, what are we going to do? It does feel like quite a big lift to address. So we're not really progressing. Well, we don't. I would say we are progressing, and it may not look overwhelming because we're progressing at about a million dollars of spend per year against a multi-tens of million dollar target. Sure, and again, like Alan mentioned, some stuff gets added, but maybe not more than, never more than a million a year additional stuff. So we're going to somehow make inroads on the sidewalk. Yeah. All right, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that $26 million backlog that includes places where there's no sidewalks, I assume it excludes private ways? 100%. Just check it. Yes. Coders. Please, yes. Coders. I would start with your question. The million and a half, the budget, of which $750 is assumed to cover. So that's where you see there's something being covered by other incentives to drive on. This is a requirement of the pending renewal of the contract. So there's a world where it could go away. But right now, this is to supply every home with both a recycling and a trash decoder to cut down on the labor costs for the trash program. But if we get granted... Is that missing a minus something?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's a $1.5 million project, so $750 would be sort of like our expense, and $750 is like sort of grant cover. Okay. But it's to represent the total cost. I'd just like to add to this that there is, like David said, there's a world in which this becomes very advantageous to us. If we do not arrive at that world, then we could sweep this money and not buy the coders. This is a... I know that you are all very well aware that this is a looming problem for us. It's trash and recycling. A lot of the haulers these days want you to move to something that they can use their robotic arms to remove the waste from your house. So having these uniform totals would allow for that kind of an operation. Who knows when we issue an RFP on this, like who's going to respond and how they're going to respond. It may not require this, and it may not be a thing. We feel like we have to reserve this in our plan in order to potentially land an advantageous contract. It's going to be, I think, very expensive either way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, good. You're going to talk about... I channeled you the other night. It seems like maybe a good opportunity to consider pay-as-you-throw. This is definitely an opportunity to do that. Part of the $750,000 grant, broken into two grants, because we're looking at sort of two different totals, a larger recycling total and then a smaller trash total. With a smaller trash total comes almost a forced change in behavior for residents. You only have a finite number of gallons of trash. You would have to either purchase excess bags or another total or something along those lines. And so that is sort of where the calculus comes in, whether this is advantageous to us as a town or not. So we don't know yet. This is still being sort of discussed and negotiated. Well, not even negotiated yet. It's being discussed and sort of like conceived with the town managers and the DBW director, along with sort of a number of different people who are talking right now to try to figure out what's the best way to move forward. So this conceivably could involve a pay-as-you-throw model. Really what that would do is it would shift a lot of these excess costs on to sort of like your user base who are using it more. So they pay for a basic level of service. And then anyone who produces a ton of extra waste, then they are going to have to pay for it a little extra. It just seems like going to Toters requires a fair behavioral change. How much are those Toters if a resident needs to buy one? I think that would depend on the contract. I don't know. I'm thinking I have had to replace half a dozen recycling bins because of the treatment that they get. They get tossed around. I happen to have these exact Toters. Like the Toters that are pictured, I don't know what they are. They cost me about $60 to $70 each. And so how does this work with parked cars? Yeah, so there would be requirements on where you would be able to place your trash can. It would have to allow for access for this robotic arm. And I don't know the sort of specifics of that, but there are countless communities that are denser than Arlington that do this. So I'm sure that there are ways to make it work, but I don't know what the specifics are. So when you say depending on which size Toters are ultimately selected, so we would have to choose the right size Toter to be eligible for the grant? Right. So the DEP is calling for a 32-gallon size trash Toter, which is small. It's like a little bit bigger than your sort of normal round trash can, you know, like the curbside one. And so the recycling cans are 64 gallons, so they're double that. They're bigger. And so that's kind of like the base level that you can qualify into the DEP grant. And have you looked around at all at sort of like how much most people are throwing out? Yeah. Waste tonnage likely isn't going to change much. Okay. Because I'm throwing away less than 32 gallons, so that would be fine, but they're going to us. Right, and it's hard to do this on like a micro level. We can look at it like sort of we track this by like when the trash goes to the incinerator, our recycling goes to the plant. So I don't know if it's easy to track on a household basis, but we can spread it across all of our households and find this level of the 32 gallons would suffice. But there are, every household is different. Like I have six people who live in my house, so we're going to produce a lot more waste than two people, you know, so. You know, I'll make you do it. There you go. That's what we need.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al Tosky and then Topher and then Charles. Are there any other urban areas near us where these toters are used? I mean I've seen these used in a lot of places, but the ones I've seen them used are in suburban areas where people usually don't park on the street. People park on the street a lot. And if they park in front of your trash cans or your toters, the truck can't get to them. So I lived in Medford. And we had these for trash and recycling yard waste was not one of the toters, but we had, it was just like this program. I lived in a two-family in a neighborhood full of two families, it was very dense, it was mostly street parking and that was how we got rid of our waste there. And it worked completely fine there. So Medford uses this for trash. They put it on the street, basically. Yeah, you put it right against the curb of the street. Right, Topher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Okay, Charlie. Yes. Any other questions on the toters? All right. Next slide. And then this is a more granular view of what we're showing earlier. A bit of what we were showing earlier on how the DPW breaks out against general and vehicles and then this coming year versus the out years. The administration line, you see the 750, or the 1.5 is the toters. And then within the highway and the water and sewers where you see most of the rest of the four and a half million of other. And across the five years, we're at 39 million of total spend within DPW. Not net. Maybe not the right time, but it's right here. So the water and sewer is dear to my heart. And it's dear to our heart that it's near to his. Yeah, it's 2.9 million, and it's all under other, right? So I think I just want to verify this. So 901.5, that's MWRA, is the other, I believe, right? That's the stuff we asked for the town meeting. And then we have the 450 for drainage rehab and 50 for hydrant water replacement. Are those separate bonds that get quoted? Is that how that gets financed? Is that the right way to run it? No, I'm not entirely certain how we're financing those next year. But yeah, we will borrow for them. We do fund some things out of the water and sewers operating budget, but I think we finance almost all of them. They'll come from the water sewer enterprise fund in the end, so it doesn't affect this plan. Right, it now lives outside of this plan, essentially. So they come from the enterprise fund. Right, yeah. Whether they're bonded, and then the bonds are paid from the bonds, or paid in cash. Well, so they're not under bond, that's why it's funded. They're actually in the regular water sewer budget. And that can be a little confusing, because they are displayed here. And we also show them in the operating budget of water and sewer. But it's just for transparency purposes. I wouldn't call it the operating portion of the budget. Portion of the budget, yeah. That's sort of the portion. But OK, so they're non-MWRA, and they're just funded from the retained earnings, which are from the fund balance. OK, thank you.</blockquote>

Is that $4.6 million here on this slide as well? And I'm just wondering, is it basically like the first four lines, like $1.5 million? It's water sewer, the water sewer line, a portion of highway, and that's a portion of half of the administration. So the $4.6 is kind of a subset of that $7.7 million. I mean, we don't have to get into the DAAC, but it's yeah. We'll give you a chance to do that.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Magee and John Griffin - 633</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, got it. And actually, real quick follow up on that. The debt service on whatever, the $4.6 million, I guess the $7.7 million, the debt service on that, does that come through the DPW budget? The water sewer, no. It lives in the water and sewer budget. But it means a non-budget. And again, I see 2.9 of the water sewer, but I assume there's a good chunk that is not water sewer. Does that debt service go through the DPW's budget? I'm just curious, because it doesn't go through your budget. It shows up as previously bonded. Yeah, it lives in the capital plans, previously bonded. So it comes through as an expense, but it doesn't get. We bundle all of the prior issue exempt and not exempt debt. We have those as their own lives within the plan. So it comes through as like prior non-exempt debt service. It's kind of baked into those numbers. Correct. And then anything that we buy in this plan shows up in the line labeled new non-exempt debt service. Yeah, so it can be complicated, but I feel like the DPW expenses do go through your budget. If you guys are paying the debt service, then you're paying for it, right? They go through our budget. They're not in a separate DPW budget, which is what I thought we were answering. Maybe we didn't answer it clearly. Yeah, so real quick. So the 4617, which was DPW, and you're showing what's the capital expenditure for you, the capital plan, and then you had a current expenditure for the capital planning. Then you had other, and the other was $4.6 million. And I said, so those are capital expenses, but generally, their DPW did not go through your committee. I probably didn't ask it clearly, and you guys said yes. But now, and I'm learning, but now it sounds like you guys actually do pay the debt service on that, on that, it feels like. Yeah, anything. You also have other funded things. You don't pay the debt service. If you look, let's go to page 19, slide 19. Under public works, which is the top row there, you'll see different funding categories, bond, cash, and other. So there's about $1.1 million of FY25 expenses that we're planning to issue bonds for, and it will be paid for under the line that's labeled new non-exempt debt service in the capital budget, in future years' capital budgets. So that's how you can see where that money comes from. There's cash, which is paid for in this year's capital budget, and there's other, which is paid by some source outside the capital budget. In this case, the water sewer enterprise funded the majority of it. The DEP grant is another chunk of it, but the anticipated DEP grant, yeah? It's not a long list, so we can just go through it very quickly, so let's jump in. So of the 4.5, it's 750 is the half of the totals that we expect a grant for. There's 10 grand for headstone cleaning, which comes from the cemetery investment, or potential cemetery. There's 760 in roadway. There's 125 in the roadway grant. What's the number? CBG. 760 in, top of 90 in CBG, 125. And then the 2.9 that's public, that's water and sewer, 450 for drainage rehab that comes from the enterprise fund, 50 grand that comes from the enterprise fund for hydrant and valve replacement, 900 that someone previously referenced for the sewer system rehab, and 1.5 for water system, and those are both. Those and gallery, the last one. So there's, it's not bonded, it's other funding. So the other is truly other, like really. They're not just part of the building. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any more questions on high school? All right. All right. I'm assigned to represent our biggest customer. The school department. I'm going to try to be convincing, and hopefully you'll endorse it for the kids. Even when I tell you that we plan on spending around $4.6 million, basically in 2025, and around $12 million over the course of the next five years. Most projects are funded with that because they relate to building innovation and upgrades. And our largest projects in this plan are Bishop and Hoddy for approximately $7 million. Bishop, we plan on spending $2.8 million in 2024, the current year, and fiscal year 2025. We've already appropriated 1.5, 1.6 for the roof replacement in fiscal year 2024. We have the design complete, and it is scheduled to go to bid this month. We're going to need $500,000 for envelope repairs to resolve the water penetration. We've completed a visual survey. The work is scheduled to start in April, and this is because we have active leaks and damaged doors. There will be sealing of the windows, replacing the frames, glazing the windows, replacing doors. Once we're done with the roof replacement, we would like to have solar arrays. The cost is $348,000. The useful life is 20 years, and we hope to have a payback of seven years. This payback is realized via rebates and also energy savings from monthly bills. The school department would also like to have a reconfiguration of the front office. Their initial request was $500,000, but we brought it down to $350,000. We requested to adjust the scope. They want to add two offices, one for the assistant principal, who is currently working from a closet, and also a social worker. These people need space for confidential meetings. This is a lot of work and would involve moving the walls, the PA system, the electrical, plumbing, and IT wiring, and so on. It will also enhance, help me out with this word, the vestibules, vestibules, security, and they will be able to lock someone in in case they have an emergency. Then moving on to Hathi, this is a bigger project. We need around $4 million between Fiscal Year 23 and Fiscal Year 26. We've already appropriated in Fiscal Year 23 $400,000 for the roof replacement, but the bids came back really high, so we're going to need another $600,000 in Fiscal Year 25. The design work is complete, and it's going to go to bid this month. Envelope repairs, this is a much larger scope than the bishop. It's going to cost us $2.2 million for windows and masonry. They completed the visual design. We don't have the written design yet. This project is really going to replace almost all the windows and the doors of this school, and also the external part of roof parapets. They will replace the broken bricks, repoint, and waterproof. And finally, when we're done with the roof, we would like to install solar arrays. The payback for this ones are six years, and the useful life is the same as the other ones, 20 years. Any questions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll get to the HVACs and our fees. I can move on. Keep going. Next slide. During this project, I've learned that since I'm not good with numbers, I should move into the HVAC. They're so expensive. I'm telling you with a little concern. So we plan on replacing rooftop units, RTUs. These are part of the HVAC. So the HVAC has AC, ventilation, and heat. The rooftop units have some, but the compressor, the coils, and the fan in a box outside the building. They're roughly $150,000 per RTU. So if you're switching the RTUs of five schools, Hardy alone needs 11 RTUs. Now, this looks like a lot of money, but believe it or not, we still have, in addition to this 1.4, we've also appropriated about 1.3 from ARPA in fiscal year 24. So it adds up a lot from the HVACs. The elevators need to be replaced. Our elevators, they're at the end of life, and some of them are beyond the life expectancies. We don't have parts for them anymore, so we cannot fix them. We just have to replace the whole unit, and the facilities director thinks that they're going to fail the state inspection. So these are a must. Is there one elevator per school? One at Pierce and one at Dallin. Oh, I don't know. In each school, I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. It's $250 each. And how many? Dallin is? One at Pierce. So in fiscal year 26, we're going to replace Pierce and Dallin, $500,000, $250 each. And in fiscal year 28, we'll replace Hardy and Stratton at $250 each. Pierce is three stories. Dallin is two. Yeah. Hardy is three. Is this a safety issue? Yes. It'd be an FY25 expense rather than a 26 expense. He said that he can suck up some blood. I don't know. Yeah. We pushed that because they came with a big list. Questions?</blockquote>

So you're replacing those that are feeding the fossil fuel system, a non-electric fossil fuel system. Correct. And what would it cost to instead of just. It's a rough number for electrifying whole schools around $10 million a school. How much is electrifying? Yeah. I think it's a pretty big portion of the. Okay. We're not doing this. Well, we can't afford to do the $10 million projects. And so this is a way to keep our students comfortable. I don't know. That's kind of the arena that we're looking at. Josh. Other questions. I didn't think that schools were generally air conditioned. Are there. The media center. Some are. Yeah. Like all the classrooms and everything. Things like that. There are some schools that are. There's some schools. For example. I don't know. 15 years ago when they were rebuilding. It seems like. It would be more and more. During the school year. Would we think about fighting the bullet? It's going to cost. I don't know. By inviting the bullet. I don't like the same. 15 years ago when we rebuilt the school. It probably would have added a million dollars. The $6. Price tag. Now it's going to add 10 million. Five or 10 years. I mean, I have no idea. Yeah. Curious. Yeah. big project that it really doesn't fit in a capital plan, so we would have to figure out, you know, especially if we're going to march through all the schools, electrifying them, how is that going to be funded? So, the facility manager, Rob's understanding, just this is a question for yours as well, was that the ARPA money was going to be used to study the issue, right, and then to see how much it's going to cost to add it on to the school, and what that's going to look like, and what's the difference between electrification versus non, does that sound right? We had an allocation from the ARPA to do the design, there was eight packs at the schools, but we've also had appropriations from ARPA for Thompson. Okay, so we don't have actual ARPA money. Right, yeah, yes, yes, for each school, so it was additional. ARPA carried a portion of the cost. The capital carries a portion, yes, and now we're discussing only whatever the capital carries. Keep going, yeah. Bobby, can I go back one? We're missing? Oh yeah, okay, the Stratton, they need to do the lobby reconfiguration at Stratton. I know that this is a relatively new school, but the school added new positions, same thing, they need two offices for the assistant principal and for the social worker, because they have confidential meetings, especially the social worker needs privacy to discuss IEP plans, there's actually even legal documents when it comes to IEP, so this is necessary to add additional space. They plan on reconfiguring the lobby, the workroom where they have the printers, and also the waiting room for the nurse. And Gibbs additional classrooms, this is $350,000, we appropriated last year $100,000, and they need an additional $250,000 this year. They want to convert the mezzanine into three classrooms, right now they have, they teach classes in an open space, and they need to accommodate the fluctuating ways of kids, so they need additional classrooms. They have to be ADA compliance, so they have to, it's a complex project, that's why it came up a lot more, because they have to move the wheelchair elevator, and add extra stairs next to the elevator, to be part of the code, for ADA code. They also have to do HVAC changes, and all other auxiliary adjustments, like wire, fire, plumbing, PA, and so on. Questions on that? Charlie?</blockquote>

All the sixth grade kids go into that room, so this was based on their study. They anticipated that they're going to have a wave of students that need to be accommodated at that school. What's going to happen beyond this, that, we don't know, but once the kids show up to work, I guess they need classrooms, too. I think Charlie's question might be a timing question.

I mean, I think they've dedicated, like, multiple pages to their budget report this year to talk about demographics. Like, so they get it. From what I understand, at least out of the schools that we've met recently, is the challenge with Gibbs, I think you made the reference, is it's a single grade building, right? So, like, what happens is, in elementary schools is, if you have a class, let's say you have a third grade, a fourth grade class that has three sections, and a fifth grade class that has four sections, or I should say, third grade has four, fifth grade has three, but, you know, just go three, four, three, four, three, four. You can kind of move the kids around, right? You can, you know, this, you know, this row of seven classrooms is going to be four for fifth grade and three for fourth grade. The next year, we're going to flip it, right? And we're going to just bounce it back and forth, things like that, right? Challenging arrangement. The kids can't do that. It's one sixth grade. So, you can have a class of 400 show up, a class of 400 show up, a class of 400 show up, and a class of 600 show up. And actually, that's wildly made up, by the way. But you can't, you have to deal with that one year, it's a day year. And that's what they've been saying for years that they have stress on, is they have no way to load balance those kids that are coming. I mean, so that's the challenges they talk about it. Just a comment on projecting these things with, we don't know yet the impact of the MVTA Communities Act and potentially other zoning changes to increase the town's density. So, I guess I don't put a lot of credibility on projections out further than a couple of years. We could have serious growth and we have no idea. At this point, this is a near term problem. So, right. Probably.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playground. All right. So, the school needs $880,000 to do a complete overhaul to the bracket playground. We allocated $80,000 in fiscal year 23. And we're asking for another $800,000 in fiscal year 25. The project is in the design phase. This is the playground where we had an injury reported back in 2021, I believe 22. And they plan on replacing the equipment, replace the wood chips with rubber and upgrade the basketball court. The project is in design and it's planned, it's scheduled to start this summer. Any questions?</blockquote>

And I spent a lot of time up at Robbins Farm and during school hours, the bracket playground is only four. There's nobody in Robbins Farm. And out of school hours, Robbins Farm is four. There's nobody in a bracket playground. I was just wondering if there's any talk about like multi-use of one big playground? And just to add to that, I went to the bracket school and we didn't have a playground on site when I was a kid. So we went across the street every day. Yeah, you have to cross the street. Yeah.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, of course, our playgrounds are sort of a weird animal because some belong to the school and some belong to the town. You have a little bit of paperwork. Yeah, but I think the town is not necessarily willing to exclude citizens from the playground in order for the school to take it over. So I think there's been some question about, we really want to have a situation where we mix. Yeah, for school hours, there's nobody in the park playground. Because all the kids are at school. Younger kids, in this case. Very few. Well, yeah, I think the problem has been the question of, you know, how would we exclude the public from that now school playground? They didn't come to that conclusion. Well, we excluded them from the bracket playground, right? We don't want them to get in the way of saving a million bucks. It sounds like there was discussion. There was a discussion. It was rejected. Yeah, it was rejected. So maybe that's a million dollars we wouldn't, or $880,000 we wouldn't necessarily have to spend. Or could spend it on something else. More sidewalks.</blockquote>

Annie, I would just like to suggest that in the modern era, having a dedicated playground closer to the school building, particularly when it can be translated, it's a security issue. You know, it depends on the Robin's farm playground. If I were a parent of a grandchild in 2024, I would not want my child that far from the ability to get into a building under current circumstances. So when I went to bracket, we had three pedophiles living within the school district. When you went to the bracket, those three pedophiles didn't own the AR-15s.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So we're going to shift gears here and look at facilities. So the Robins library, we're looking to do a, sort of calling the main entryway plaza. There's stairs there. There are granite slabs in there in disarray. They're sort of heaved and out of alignment with each other and tripping hazards. Looking to do, so a full plaza renovation there to the tune of $725,000. Town hall renovations. This is something that we request annually at $75,000. This will be dedicated to our roof and clock tower issues. But there is a massive need of town hall for work. I don't know if there would ever be an appetite to fund that on some sort of an exclusion, but the general needs are very high at town hall also. And then the DPW at the building, something that was value engineered out, is a dust collection vacuum system and maintenance shop. That's something that OSHA requires. So Sylvies is requesting that. And then the various school projects, those have all been covered, but these are all the facilities department is sort of going to be managing in FY25. I want to sort of put a premium on our facilities department. They're relatively new in town, but it's about $3.5 million in FY25 projects. So maybe we'll go to the next page and we'll take questions on these. All right. Fire station mechanical system replacements in FY26. We're looking to do mechanical, so that's like HVAC at headquarters. Waterproofing also at headquarters in FY26. That's kind of a larger combined project. And then in Highland, a mechanical system replacement FY27. And then other, these are things we've sort of touched on a couple of these, is the community safety building and elevator replacement in FY27. That elevator will be at least 21 years old. The library storefront doors, so sort of a second part of the plaza project is replacing the doors, doing that in FY27. And then already a solar array there in FY26. Questions on facilities.</blockquote>

Yeah, I'm not sure why we have to organize it here versus future years. Oh, okay, got it. Second, one of the things that was value-engineered out of VVW are these shades. And I think we're going to need to shade those. And there was just sun streaming in into the main conference room. And third, just a question. Where does the renovation of bathrooms in Robin, is that this year or next year? That's this year, but it's being funded out of CPA money. Oh, CPA. Yeah, that is happening. CDBG. Excuse me, CDBG.

One, town hall, when we did our budget reviews over there, department heads, I mean, even the slum board's office, right, meeting room is in need of repair. I'm a bit confused. I mean, you all, some of you work there and see it. How do we let it get to this without insisting that more spend on it? I mean, I understand asking for department heads to come with projects, but is there any proactive force that says, no, you need to do more than what you're asking for?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Moore - 172</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, so the general awareness of the need is high. Our town manager ran our facilities department for a while on sort of an interim basis. And he's, so he was a certified contractor, very sort of aware of these kinds of issues and how to deal with them. It's going to be a hugely extensive job to fix. So I don't know if, I don't know why the requests have not come in the past. I don't know that I can really answer to that, but it is on our radar looking into the future. And it'll probably be coming next year, the year after for some envelope work. So the only thing is that in the past, we used to allocate $100,000 every year for town hall. And because of budgetary constraints, we've brought it down to 75. When in reality, we need triple, more than triple. We're also looking to see funds to do some of the work. One idea that we're considering is community preservation money for that.</blockquote>

And we talked about the Fox Library and sort of knowledge in 2015 to 2018, when plans were made that there were lots of PDA non-compliant issues and that nothing was done really since then to fix those. Is there any proactive force amongst you to sort of force some ADA compliance issues? I see later in the presentation, you are doing 100,000, I guess, in ADA compliance. But historically, it seems like you've been not focusing on areas where we know we have to have ADA compliance on town buildings, like the Fox Library.</blockquote>

Just when I was meeting with the treasurer, she mentioned that one of the staff there in the workspace had got completely trashed. The snow and the rain came in and one of the desks and computers broke. And it's just not acceptable to ask someone to work on that. I gathered last year that they were looking for $385,000 in CTA money. I don't know whether this year we can ask for that. And that the total budget is $10 million. That's the right scale. For the town hall? Yeah. I think it's much bigger than that. Well, for the envelope work. For envelope work, yeah. The building as a whole, the frames and that, probably.

And that position was eliminated as a result of Proposition 2.5. And as a result of that position being eliminated for a number of years, the maintenance of all our town buildings took a real major hit, including the town hall. And if something had to come up, it was piecemeal, band-aid approach, until they brought back the patents of facilities. And there was a pretty good gap of years. And I remember when I was on the school committee, a fellow on the school committee, Bill Carey, kept on saying, we're going to pay the price for this down the road if we don't maintain our buildings.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Moore and Charles Foskett - 426</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it's a representative picture. About five years ago, finished renovating the central fire station. Ten years ago. Longer than that. Yeah. How long ago? Ten years ago. So we have, how much are we spending here on the central? About 500K. The mechanical system? Mechanical and water proofing. Correct. Water proofing in the last 10 years. We're approving last 10 years. Yeah. That's sort of amazing. Then it says that the high school is going to be leaking in 10 years. I'm just asking the question. What I'm concerned about is what. You know, it should be. And if we're letting these contracts. Out and winding up with inferior work. It's costly. I'm also. I'm not disagreeing that the. But $75,000 a year for the next five years. That looks to me like operating maintenance costs, not capital costs. And I don't understand why I said the capital budget. The plan for that money is the first to be identified to actual projects that are big enough to be capital. So it's not supposed to be a. You know, replacing doorknobs or anything like that. Five years worth of. Actually identified projects that you've seen in a plan. Not yet. What we've done for that. Well, we had a choice to not include them at all. And just, you know, say, we think it only takes 75K this year. Cause these are the ones. This is where we know we're going to spend money. And that seemed like it wasn't really straightforward at all, because we know that it's going to be. Bathrooms here and folds and rooms and who knows what else going on. So we tried to make, yes, it's something reasonable. And then for every year, when we get to the actual budget year, We make sure that we're talking about projects. So that's been our approach to that. And then a few others. Okay. So we're going to do a chemical system replacement. Island. Or sent or no center of town. One in 26 and one. And is that a complete replacement of the HVAC system? I think it is not a complete. I don't think it does interior. It's true. So I'm not positive. Or are we just. I'm not certain. Okay. I'd really like to know. Great. Yeah. And it's also. Correct. And so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So just another quick. A lot of people. Has been problematic. Constructions. Since before I went to the school. And it's also built on a four. Correct. And so. Digging up more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Nice. Recreation. For the kids. So, yeah, I think. We're back to earlier. The sort of funding, which is what. I paid for a lot of playground work. The last few years is now all done. So we're back to paying for playgrounds. Feels through. The capital plan or. So. Where we are today. So. Those who don't know it's that's on the other side, pretty much of the cemeteries. Right where. Valley Parkway. Intersect. As a playground. It was closed. By the DCR because they actually own the underlying land. Two years ago. And so it really needs to be. Placed. Closer to the intersection. Yeah. So. The park project. As right now, there are no other major park projects in the, in the five-year plan. At least. First for this as opposed to CPA. And what they're proposing to do in FYI. To master plans. One for fields. Any other for playgrounds. Sort of figure out kind of what our future. Needs to hold for. So. What we're going to talk about. Sort of goes to the question earlier about school playgrounds is that, you know, This is a very controversial thing to say out loud is that perhaps. We can't afford to, or don't have a need to have. Playgrounds that we have. And so that's going to be part of what that's going to look at. And then the field part, we'll be looking obviously at, you know, sort of athletic field needs. Across the town. And then they have three things they do every year. The sort of continuing expenditures. One is ADA study. Implementation plan. So that's improving the. Accessibility of our parks and playgrounds. Feasibility study, which they basically use to plan out future projects. So, you know, we're going to be looking at a couple of those smaller and large scale projects and sort of figure out scope schedule and budget for those. So that they actually, when they do come to us. With a request. Good sense of what the cost will be. And then something that was added more recently, which is the playground audit. It saves the improvements, which is making sort of. Smaller, but still capital eligible repairs. To playground when a piece of equipment breaks and needs to be replaced. So that we can, you know, we can have a little bit more flexibility. To respond to those kinds of capital repairs. That are smaller. Questions.</blockquote>

Somebody's been going around town, closing playgrounds. And the playground. The park has been closed. For whatever reasons. Allegedly because it was dangerous or whatever. And. I was involved in having a professional engineer review it before it was shut down. And minor maintenance could have kept that playground over. I don't know. I don't know what the story is probably going on there. So, you know, the children in the town are being held hostage. I don't know. Consulting firm or some, some jihadists on the.

And obviously the Thompson is a, is a school playground. Thank you. Yeah. My response to him was, aren't 10 year olds allowed to break their arms at the playground anymore? You have to shut an entire playground because somebody hurt themselves. That's insane. Well, I think that the $75,000 is to help head off some of these issues where like we have a broken piece of equipment. And we're not going to be able to fix it. So we're going to have to go and get it fixed. Or we're going to have to go and get it replaced. Or something like that. Right. And so if we are.

We're asking you to vote favorable action on our recommended budget for fiscal year 25, the re-appropriation of unused capital funds, which I'll cover in just a minute, and to endorse the five-year plan. So to cover the sort of overall budget, this particular formulation of the budget is one that's been requested over the years by the Finance Committee, where we see both exempt and non-exempt debt service adding to about $20 million, cash capital spending of about five, and then there's the offsets from the intended fund capital carry-forward, which is capital projects which were finished under budget, so that money stays in the capital plan, and the rent-and-rent enterprise funds would pay some of the debt service associated with those projects. So that other financing there, which is maybe a poor term because there's also the other category that we've talked about, grants, that's something else, brings us down to a net capital appropriation, including exempt debt of $24 million.</blockquote>

And then finally, I would like to vote that I would like to move that the Finance Committee endorse the Capital Planning Committee's, what did you call it again? Five-year plan. Five-year plan for the next three years. 25 to 29. 25 to 29, thank you so much. Just don't just stop at four. You're out. Stuck in the stack. Yes, they are. Do you have anything you want to add? No.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Alan Jones and John and Rebecca have some questions. The parking control vehicle, 32,005 years old, says it's being paid for by the parking fund. The parking fund offset isn't listed in that table, like the entire fund. Can you be a part of the offset? By this table, you mean page 37? Yeah. So, it's a future purchase, whereas table 37 is FY25. Okay. So, we'll be there. Likely, we would just list it as other funded. Wait, so it's not listed on FY25? It's in there. Oh, so it is another, sorry. It's not an offset, it's another funding source. Yeah. What's the difference in the entire fund and the parking budget? What's the difference? The incentive fund that we can spend on, my understanding of the incentive fund is we collect the money, and we can spend it on parks and recreation. Or parks and recreation. So, yeah, the parking fund, where's the 32,000 come from? It comes from money revenue. It's already paid directly. It's like an enterprise fund. Yeah. Right, well, you've got those enterprise funds on that table. We have a couple of them listed. Yeah, no. I'm just wondering, what's the difference between the antenna fund or the enterprise fund versus getting the- I think the other ones are listed as general offsets, and that is like, has a specific plan. Okay. I'm not quite as clear as, yeah.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John? Yeah, thank you. My question is related to the 4.9 million in the cash capital. And I think last year it was 3.9 million in the same category of cash capital. I understand that we allocate 5% of our budget to capital expenditures. But the thing that kind of sticks in my head is do we necessarily have to spend 5% every year? And for instance, I looked into the 3.9 that was allocated last year, and I think only 786K have been spent so far. And I know this is a tough question for like 956, but I just wonder if, could we add a column to the spreadsheet going forward, or is it considerate where you have a bank that we'll save them on? Is there any mechanism where you can just say, all right, we don't really have anything to spend this money on, but we know we need to spend 5% of our budget on capital each year, but we have nothing to spend it on this year. Let's just kind of bank it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We don't really have a mechanism to do that. That's not a problem we typically have. We're trying to get rid of projects and afford. Okay, so I look at the, again, that current year expenditures. It does seem like there's a little bit of like kind of filler in there. And again, just to support that, I said, what happened to the 3.9 million that current spent last year? Only 780K of it has been spent. I know this. But there's also in Congress says, so we need to look at it. So either ran several reports. So keep in mind, I mean, the way government spending works we've never even seen as late as the moment. Yeah. There's a lot of, whether it's getting quotes, getting procurements or with the DPW stuff, getting a lot of that at the same moment. So what you're seeing in March isn't necessarily really accurate with what we'll get spent. But then it's the other question about banking money. And I think we've heard bang, there's overwhelming needs for really more than 5%. But we could do that. So the challenge seems like we have like big expenses that we just, we have no real way to address the big expenses like Tom Hall. But there's all sorts of 700Ks there, 600Ks there, 100Ks there, but there's nothing like, there's no $8 million.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any 5% capital? That's the capital issue. What we can afford. Yeah. I just wanted to raise it. I know it's 957. I wanted to raise the question. Can I also add that, yes, we've spent 700,000, but we've also encumbered 500,000. So there's some legal obligations. But then there's still 2 million plus that hasn't- Right. And that's a time made. So most of it is gonna, they're gonna start to work, like BBW, for example, and this is right. Yeah. I just thought if you could take the pressure off of spending 5%, putting 5% aside is great, but do you necessarily have to spend 5%? And I guess that's not a problem. Just raising the question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two last questions, Rebecca, and then I'll toss. Thank you. So I have a question about something that's sort of missing from this plan. And that is, there's a separate warrant, or a separate article of the warrant I'm sure you've seen for the Fox Library for the $150,000 to keep it planning for the rebuild of the Fox Library. So I'm starting to achieve our question, which is why is that not part of the capital plan? And isn't that something that you considered? So why is the Fox Library somehow unique in that it's a separate warrant article? And then the second part is, if that were to go forward, is there space in the five-year plan for the actual build of the Fox Library? Is that something the committee has altered?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Moore - 199</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the Fox Library has been on our radar for a long time, as you might expect. The reason that there's a separate warrant article for that funding is that it's required by the Mass Board of Library Commissioners. Yeah, Board of Library Commissioners, from which we hope to get a grant, which would cover 40, 50% presumably of the cost. The exact cost is unknown at this point, that's part of what we're finding out. But should we decide to move forward on that library and get a bill for it, so we know how much we're gonna spend, we'll have to figure out as a panel whether that's something we wanna try to fit in the capital plan, or we wanna do a debt exclusion, or let us put the process with you. So there's no space already out there that I see. There's no reserved space. Right, we try not to reserve space for things that are a little too theoretical to know if we're doing them. Because the answer to the question, is are we doing this library, may depend a lot on whether we get that grant or not. Thank you, I'll pass these.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, three questions. On page 30, it says under other robins, storefront doors. Now, we get a lot of robins buildings in this town. Is that the robins house? The library. The library. The front door is at the left. Those are $300,000? Yeah. Okay, second question. I think Al Jones's comment was, I think it's important in trying to simplify and be transparent to have all of the projects in one place and all of the funding sources in one place. Whether they're enterprise funds, parking funds, it wouldn't be hard to just add the cost up here and then down here have from parking fund. In that way, it's all in one place. So not asking you to change it now, but think about that for next year. That's what we thought we were doing on slide 16. On slide 16, you'll see something that looks more like what I think you're asking for. Yeah. Well, this is like 15,000 from recreation, 32,000 from benefit. Yeah, and that's above the 5% wise. My third question is, it doesn't sound like it. Do you have any rescissions or prior borrowings? No. Okay, in that case, I'd like to add another motion to vote no action on article 41, which is the rescission order.</blockquote>
