<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, let's start with the. Proving the minutes of February, okay. Okay, there it is, all right. I have two corrections, uh, one correction, one addition for, uh, attendance, Al Tosty and Jennifer Seuss were attending remotely. And on item eight on the second page, um, DI, yep, the vote was 13 in favor and one opposed. That's how it's written. You don't have a one. I don't have a one. You don't have a one. Oh, one opposed. Oh, I have the, did someone just write that in? Yeah, that's just cut out. Oh, okay. Didn't get tracked. Any other corrections that anyone noticed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rebecca? Um, on 9A, the vote, uh, was, that should refer to the Early Childhood Counseling Center. It says counseling on aging on the breadcrumbs, so just correct that to AYCC. And then, um, in the table, sorry, yep. In the table, the very last, um, item where it says Council on Aging Enterprise Fund, I would insert the word transportation for Council on Aging Transportation Enterprise Fund. And I just want to check with, um, John or Daryl on item three under FIRE, um, third sentence, advanced life services, medical services is covered by Armstrong and transportation is covered by FIRE. Is that correct?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>Controller's Budget</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 1048</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Carol, I'm here. No, she's not going to be here. Yes, it's me. You want me to share that, Charlie? Yeah, maybe I can share it. Can I share it? Yeah, sorry, let me just enable that really quick. Okay, now you should be able to. Can you see it? Almost. There we go. Thank you. Okay, so Carol and I met with Peter Cote on the 7th. By the way, page 39 is written. Where's that? Page 39. So a couple of different issues here. Salary, expenses, and justice budget, and some interesting things that she's accomplished. The first thing is the original salary budget, which is on the screen here. It's also in your book. Has the comptroller at higher than the max in the M-Schedule? We very politely explained to her that's a no-no. It appears that the town manager and the finance director are planning to grant a COLA to the M-Schedule personnel sometime after the bargaining issues are settled. And so that's fine, but she still can't get the COLA that they had in here if she's above the max in the M-Schedule. So Carol and I had independent discussions with the finance director, Alice McGee, and with Karen Beloy. They have agreed that they will solve the problem probably by changing the M-Schedule and the classification schedule and including an adjustment for her salary probably either in the M-Schedule or in the reclass warrant article or in the collective bargaining issue. But it can't be in the regular budget. I mean, I can't imagine our chairman defending a salary schedule above the max. So there is a somewhat of an apparently large adjustment in this person, Zhang, I can't remember her first name, but she's been reclass, a senior accountant, and there's an adjustment made after the last year's budget. So that's why it's not clearly reflected. And then, Guyan is the principal accounting clerk in the junior position. So fundamentally, in addition to Ida, the three people there are relatively new in the department, which has an effect on the expenses. So on the slides, we're going to go in order here. Okay, so in any event, we changed the, if you look on the slide here, it's slide four, the M-Schedule max that the comptroller has shown. And so what we did is we changed the increase to the comptroller to get it to the max that permitted the current M-Schedule. And then, as you know, it has to be addressed in the two warrant articles that I just described. I'm going to skip, somehow I inserted these slides in the wrong place here. So the resulting, I'm going to pass these out. Thank you. I have a thesis, the new budget is, there's a sheet of paper here. So you can see on this next slide, the adjusted salary for the comptroller. And then there's a, the adjusted difference is the reduction of 2282. And then, on the expense budget, that goes through the salary and again, the total budget, the gross check total budget is adjusted by 2282. So the one thing that we investigated with her somewhat seriously was whether or not the prior expense levels were appropriately being reflected. In other words, you know, if you had for a number of years, you have lower expenses, and now suddenly they're higher. And it turns out that she had vacancies in the department the last couple of years that resulted in lower out-of-state travel and in-state travel expenses and lower training expenses. Now that she's got essentially these three new people, they all need to be trained on Munis. And that's pretty intensive training sessions. Plus, she and the senior accountant have to be, I'll use the term certified, I'm not sure that's the exact term, but there's three different accounting, three different organizations they have to be certified by. One is Munis, one is the MMMA, Mass Municipal something or other accountants. And the other is the MIA. So, the expense budgets are really going back to the level where they were in the past and will be spent as opposed to not being spent. So, I'd like to go back now to the charter accounts issue. So, she basically created a new chart of accounts. And I believe I uploaded the document on that in the, that was in the SharePoint, if it's not there, I'll get it there. But it's a fairly difficult task, a large task. And so, she implemented that change herself with her staff. And if she hadn't brought in outside consultants, it would have cost more than $100,000. This was like, you know, a year long or a year and a half long effort. So, we will see a new charter accounts that are much more logical and organized going forward. And they will, the accounting department will take the past year's data and budgets and recast it to the new chart of accounts. So, that we won't go bananas trying to understand the budgets with one set of numbers and then another set of numbers. In other words, they will reconstruct the history in the new chart of accounts. And the main intent here is to provide better control and better transparency on mostly expense spending, but also labor spending, some labor spending. Generally speaking, I felt that they needed a new chart of accounts, you know, for the last 10 or more years. But nobody got around to it except me. And I personally think that she's one of the better managers that we've had in that accounting department in my memory. And she's pretty energetic. And, you know, one of the reasons why we're being somewhat efficient, this finance committee session is because I think we're running into fewer errors than we've had in the past, in the reports that they're giving us. And that's in part due to her aggressiveness. So, that's it for the accounting, for the accounting budget. And I'm going to try to find the next slide, I can't read it, it's more printed on the screen. So, we are supporting a taxation total budget of $363,062 for the comptroller's budget, and to do that, then we adopt that. All right, questions?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? and Charles Foskett - 175</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you going to go further into MUNIS, is that coming up? You had some materials available about progress with MUNIS. Yeah, I put it, I think, is it on the website? Yeah. Yeah, I didn't, I wasn't reading a lot of it. You mean on the... It was in the email. Yeah, I wasn't going to drag everybody through that. Okay, well, my question was going to be whether there was any initiatives towards moving the budget process to MUNIS. Well, that's what I... Oh, actually moving the budget process. Using the MUNIS budget model. We didn't discuss that. But I assume, because you have got this in the new chart of accounts, that it will be largely driven by MUNIS. Okay, because a lot of the states are referring to her, because we have those fine points, those spreadsheets. Yeah, so that's actually more at the Alex McGee level, and his budget director, as opposed to Eda Cody. Well, she needed to enable it. Yeah, she has the basic information. Okay, thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sophie Migliazzo - 54</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other questions? Sophie, can you just re-explain this to me? I'm sorry, I might have zoned out a little bit. On her, on the salary and the max, so the base is not, the base is the max. Which is still the same in the book. And what has changed? Is there a step?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett and Sophie Migliazzo - 344</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in the sheet that I passed around, it's the minimum step. That's the step that we're recommending. That gets her to the max in the schedule. Okay, great, because the base is step one. Oh, great. The new pay is... Still above. Yeah, the new pay is still above max. Well, the new... You changed the base, you didn't change the minimum. Well, the new pay... So I was just trying to understand, the max is supposed to be... Doesn't include longevity. The max doesn't include longevity. I know, but the max, I thought... If you, I believe it should be equal to the new pay. If you take 15.17 and add it to, I think I did this, you add it to one... New pay is equal to the base plus the step, and then longevity. They add the longevity. But I thought that max is... That's my question. Is max supposed to be the new pay, which is base plus step, or is max supposed to be base and you can still get a step? Let me see if I can go ahead. So max is the base, right? Max is the cap on the base. On the base. So why does it matter whether her step is 692 or 2974? Because in both cases, the base was the max. I don't know the right answer. Do you follow, Charles? That's a good question. What page is that on, 150? 139, right? Oh, I see. Well, I don't know the answer to it. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I think we'll have to come back. Okay. Let's. Let's keep pushing. It might be right. I just. Yeah. I'm not 100% sure. We reduce the. Reduce the step. Yeah. It hasn't changed and that's still the max. So we're only taking this stuff. Yeah, I have to go back and find out where I got my deduction from. Okay. Yeah, I can't answer that question. I hate to say this. It looks like I might've been mistaken. Oh, my God. All these years.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 261</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate you admitting. Charlie, maybe you can get this answer for us. By meeting on Monday. And in the meantime, does anyone have any other questions? All right, so let's postpone. So I just would like to add one thing. I sent around, I investigated with. The issue of the. The cost of the auditor that was raised during the. Select court. So I circulated her response. Which is pretty lengthy, but basically power to Sullivan recently got acquired by another company. She said that their price went up to 3,000 every. I think she said two or three years. Yeah. And that's probably on the average around 5%. Or less increased for the year. In. In general, she's pretty happy with the. Services. So I don't sense that there's going to be a. As long as they continue to get the team. That's been working in town. For the last several years, I don't think that there's going to be. I don't think that there's going to be. Those sort of services for. In this house. And so, and what about the thought of how. It's budgeted at 78. The actuals are at 65. If we know there's sort of a 5% increase every year. Yeah. That was in his luck. So. Or just for next year. I think that was the idea. Bring this up on Monday. Or just to let her know that next year. I don't know what. We have a position. I don't know. Because decide whether we need to take a position or not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant. Thank you. Did you say. Yes, the charter of accounts implementation is a big deal. It's also. My experience. Typically. Difficult to go back in the past. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do you. Indicate that we've actually have this data. Well, I expressed concern over the. Analysis that we normally do. Because the prior year is always a budget because we don't have. Actuals. And then the year before that is. Actual. I don't know whether it should go back an additional year or not. That's. Definitely ambitious. I suspect she's had to do a lot of analysis. Those. Expenses anyway. Decide what's happening. For the conversion. Thank you. Any other questions on the control. I'm just genuinely curious. I don't, I don't know the answer to that. I know we have. We moved from a text-based system to a windows-based system. Five years ago. And in the last time that I was involved in that. We allocated. A significant amount of money. It moves to the cloud and I don't know what version. That is exactly. But it's supposed to be. It's probably whatever they update it to. We're probably not paying for a version. They're probably just automatically doing it. They're not. No, they do. Okay. On a regular basis. Once it's in the cloud, our support contract covers. Yeah. A lot of effort to migrate data from. So glad to see that. Well, I think they were kind of like.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other questions on this. All right, Charlie, if you can get those answers. Our next week. Okay. Thank you. All right, Charlie, if you can get those answers. Our next meeting. That'd be great. And we'll postpone this. And you haven't had the budget.</blockquote>

<summary>Retirement Budget</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?1 - 1243</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have. Retirement. Do you want to do that? I'll start. Okay. You want me to share anything? Yeah. I can do it. Okay. Okay. 153 in the budget. Great. Okay. Okay. Okay. They're gone. Okay. Let's just start. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So we met with. Rich Greco. Who's the director of. The. Okay. So the first thing. The agenda was missing. I don't know what happened. Just a set of definitions because there's a lot of buzzwords. That's why we're out. So something called. Retirement board is the board that manages the active pension. So the retirement board. Does not report to the board of selectmen or to. The finance committee. Meeting per se. Reports only to. Correct. And Eric is the public employee. Retirement administration commission. And that change happened about 20 years ago, the result of some. Large number of scandals among retirement boards. And. Former town manager. Don Marquis was on the board for a number of years. The Arlington non-contributory retirement system is something that we'll refer to when we discuss open. And. That's the retirement system that existed for employees. The work of town. Up to and including 1939. And we were paying. We were paying. We were paying. Thousands of people who work. Three or four years ago. And. Under our. A prior finance committee. Chair. We developed a. Process for dealing with those funds, which we'll. We'll discuss a little bit later. And. That's where the funds are kept in this trust that get invested to. For the benefit of the retirees. Now. This means that Arlington's contributions to the retirement fund that get invested. Are invested alongside. The all the other. Retirement funds in the state. So, so the. Organization. And. Having tremendous amount of leverage because instead of a hundred and. $50 million fund or whatever. Whatever. You know, Is it a local town suddenly your money's alongside. Billions of dollars. It has much more effective. You know, Presence in the market. And we have about. The way I've been trying to learn this T stands for trust. In print. And is the management board that decides. That's what print is, is. So. The real bank M and T for only merchants and traders. Buffalo. Is where the actual cash designs. They are the definition of a good old solid bank. Founded 1856 in Buffalo. They're the only bank. Only one of two banks in the entire S and P 500. Never missed a quarterly dividend. Since 76. They've been very steady with, with, with their, with their dividends. Stone consulting talks to us. You see, there are lots of layers of oversight here. Who reports to whom. Stone consulting. Reports to us. I'm sure you're familiar with other posts and other posts. Employment benefits. ID. Health insurance. Which is. And the retirement financial year, just to note is not. This fiscal year. It's a calendar year. As we go on, you will see. References in the various slides too. What's that called? Charlie. The payouts to the individual retirees. Mr. Distributions is the correction. It makes it look. I think at one point it looks like. It's a salary. It's a distribution. Here's who are retirees. Look like. Average age. The way we talk about the active and retired. Members, the active people that are employed by the camp. Contributing. Retirement fund. Slice of their salary. And, and the retired people are people that are getting. Distributions. Nope. Sorry. I've got it up on my computer. Okay. So this, this is the. Just the statistics on the active members. The details of these things. But it shows the, the. Here's a service. Like. I don't know if you can see it. I don't know if you can. I've got it up on my computer. Okay. So this, this is the. Just the statistics on the active members. Those people who like to get into the. The details of these things. But it shows the, the. The years of service. You know, other, other demographic. Features. Like the age distribution. Years of service, et cetera. In the. And this has this. This matters. It doesn't matter. You can't immediately see this. I'm looking at it, but this. I'm looking at it. I'm looking at the liability of the fund. This is really what stone does. Charlie. Inactive. There are people who were in the fund. And have disappeared. They're not dead. They're not here and they're not collecting. And in the. But they have a liability. So it has to be accounted for. But they're members and they have assets in the fund. But they're members and they have assets in the fund. Okay. Moving on to the next slide. These are just similar statistics on the retired members. Again. What does this matter? Well. A very simple graphic example is that our retirees. And people over 65. Live longer these days. Thank God. And they pay out more. Every year. And that. That impacts. The balance of. What the town has to pay, what the employees pay, what the employees can take out, et cetera. Take it away. This is what print invests our money and all the rest. And. There's a handout that was emailed out earlier before you can read this better. This number here is significant total core. And these are by thousands. So print is holding. About a 100 million, $100 billion. In in. In total for all the towns that have invested in. In the past 10 years. And you can see that there are a number of investments. That they have put it into from the top global equity core, fixed income value, added fixed income. Private equity, real estate Timberland. Which is chiefly a hedge. Against inflation. Because it runs opposite to, to equities. I do not know what portfolio completion strategies and overlays are, but they are the ones that are the most important. And they are the ones that are the most significant. Exceptions I believe are the most significant. Because we are looking at a very. Long-term need. And therefore we are looking at long-term performance and long-term gains at the bottom. For that a hundred billion. In aggregated management. The entire fund is returning over the last 10 years, almost. 8%. It represents all of the. Contributors to, to print them. I'm not sure. Right. It should. It includes this. Yeah, me. Yeah. Okay. And since inception nine, just. One under a nine and a quarter. These are very attractive numbers. These are less. Less of fees. I'm sorry. 54 basis points, Charlie. Yes. 54 basis points, which in finance speak. Is 54 one hundreds of 1%. That's what it costs us to have our money in this font. It's a very low figure for a, for an actively managed fund. More typical of retirement funds, but especially, but still. Among retirement funds. A very low number for the management fee. So. It'll be managed by a company called PETA. And that. actually being transferred out, as we speak, to Pritt. And the reason is that they were involved in some sort of... there were a portion of the funds that existed when we made the transition to Pritt, but they were in some sort of long-term contracts, and they had to be, you know, rolled out as those contracts expired. That's just about complete. Okay, so the next slide...</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall we take that? Yeah. How many towns are comprised in that fund? Do you know? I'm not sure. Alan, do you know that? How many individual slices that $100 billion comprises?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?1 - 78</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I'm sorry, I don't. I think it's a handful that are not. They basically forced most of the towns to go in, and they have a benchmark that says if you go below a certain funding level for so many years, you have to put the money in Pritt. You can't have your local retirement board manage it. That's foolish. That's a total of 90% of it. All right, thank you. Dave, did you have a question?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?3 - 18</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. On the previous slide, you mentioned Timberland. Is that literally Timberland? Yes, it is. Fascinating. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ?1 - 924</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you can. While they are not politically as popular or as green defensible as current investor attention applies to them, extractive industries are a terrific hedge against variations in the equity market. Thank you. This slide shows again the result of how we got to the final numbers on the previous slide. You notice in purple, it's a much more jagged line. That's a year-by-year figuring of what Pritt's corpus is valued at. That's going to be subject to wilder swings. What Stone Consulting uses is a rolling average over the prior four years to try to get a better handle on where that rise and fall is actually leading to. The purple is the actual hard numbers from year to year. The green is smoothed out a little bit. The smoothing out allows us to have a better idea of how much money is available. Remember, the whole game is to get to what you would call the Dowager's retirement, where all the money in the retirement fund is all you need and all it produces is what you need to get there. But we're not there yet. We are getting there. We have some realistic projections of how long it will take us to get to that point where the sum total of money we have invested in this fund with its professional management and oversight will get to the point where it generates all of what we need to run our retirement expenses. But we're not there yet. This slide explains a little bit about what's called the unfunded actual actuarial asset. Actuarial accrued liability. I'm up close. I can read it. The little box on the upper left-hand corner is the current year's appropriations, which is $17 million $17,175,692 I shouldn't say appropriation, a contribution to the to the print. The normal cost is the amount that the town has to contribute to meet current expenses net of what are contributed by the employees that are contributing from their salaries. The net of this 3AC payments these are collections that Rich Greco manages to undertake every year averaging about $50,000 a year by going after other retirement boards that are getting away with not paying for their share of the expenses. For example one case that comes to mind and it's not in this number this is historical, but Brian Sullivan former town manager worked in other towns before he came to Arlington and he was town manager in Winchester and had other municipal roles during his career so in various towns he contributed to their pension systems he retired from Arlington now let's say he retired and he had a pension of X tens of thousands $100,000 a year something to that effect when he retired Arlington is paying that but Rich Greco has been running around the countryside for all of these employees that had previous municipal experiences making sure that the town that got the contribution 20 years ago gives us the money or somehow reduces our expense. That's what that net 3AC payment funds Just a second Charlie and conversely Rich has been very successful in challenging the 3AC contributions that other municipalities have requested of Arlington when somebody over at the other town retires at the top of the payment schedule and the bill comes to Arlington for X number of years at that number. Rich says no he worked or she worked here in Arlington for a much lower figure and our contributions to that person's retirement were substantially lower proportionally to what new town or final town was paying and working out these deals it's really been on his own initiative. It's really been advantageous for our overall scheme So the $13,807,534 $13,807,534 $13,807,534 is the amortization of the unfunded actually crude liability and the way to think about this is sort of like a mortgage. You have a liability that we have to pay off The trick here is of course that that mortgage amount is varying every year and in the the liability is this total material liability that the town has. That varies from year to year and that's offset by the assets that are in the fund so if you have let's say you have $100 million liability and you have $80 million in timberland stock or something then you have an unfunded liability of $20 million and that has to be paid off over a certain period of time and the state gets that period of time The problem that the reason why we need this consultant and this is a complicated situation is that two things two big variables happen three, the number of people paying into the fund vary every year the retirees take out funds that vary every year because they live longer or there are more retirees etc. and then of course the assets vary if the stock market goes up they're high if it goes down they're low so this is a very complicated calculation that has to be done and the result is the details are shown on the right hand side which basically says in a lot of detail what I just tried to summarize and the chart the funding schedule on the left hand side says that basically our current looking for our current unfunded liability is $118 million and then based on our contribution increasing 5.5% each year under the assumptions of the age demographics life expectancy stock market etc. I totally paid off the liability in 2034</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well theoretically that's true but practically but wait this more but practically I'm jumping ahead to the subject of OPEB but we have a huge liability for health insurance for retirees that is not really funded we've been contributing to it basically due to John Bilber's efforts starting about 15 years ago or more they've been very small contributions one of the lucky things that we have going for us is that there is no law right now that requires that it be funded at a certain rate I don't know why that's the case but that's the case but the GASB Government Accounting Standards Board requires us to report that liability on our balance sheet basically if you fund the liability at a high rate they allow you to use a discount rate that's more or less equivalent to what the improvement in the stock market is which is around 7% if you fund it at a low rate they require you to use the cost of funds for the town which is about 2 or 3% or something like that so that makes that liability very large so that has to show up on our balance sheet from a practical viewpoint as I understand it most of the bond markets are happy that we're paying some money into the OPEB and so we continue to get good bond rates</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know the answer to that but it's got to be something similar to this and so to answer your original question Andy I want to say the consensus between Al Tasti and just kidding but the consensus of a number of people that I've spoken to is that when we pay off this we use that funding amount to fund the OPEB and we may find ourselves before we get there we may find ourselves required by the state to do something more aggressive but I don't know that's going to be a select board decision probably select board we have a calculation for the OPEB liability yes we do we do 194 million we have 10% but that's a low discount rate as opposed to a high discount rate I'm just thinking how many more years before we get what we're currently paying in there is not going to do much I understand that so anyway I think the thing the town really has to focus on in my view is getting this thing what we do when we get there that's going to be a good problem to solve and this has been a moving target because every time there's a recession markets go down and then we wind up with a higher percentage of unfunded liability and then the state moves the maximum date out a few more years this is a never ending wait Charlie I'll toss to his question yeah thanks Charlie for the introduction right now that's 10 years away from fully funding the pension system and right now if we're able to establish a policy maybe starting from this committee working to the select men and the retirement board that 100% or maybe 80% of the reduction there goes immediately to fund the OPEB right now if we get that policy established nobody's looking 10 years ahead if you wait until you're a couple years ahead the more spending people on the town might say oh my god we don't have that money for pay raises anything else so it might be good to get the discussion and policy 10 years now as opposed to waiting until a few years closer to it because then the money you could they could smell someone is looking at Annie priority OPEB or eliminating the structural debts it's not wired to fund at the rate you're suggesting Andy the only way you can get rid of the structural debt is to stay lower why let's let's focus on discussion it's a different time but Michael go ahead we're about at the end these are demonstration that has proved and the amount just note that there's a line here the town is not have to pay the full 17 million the Wellington housing authority is in this pension plant and they have to $600,000 so that gets our contribution down to 16 million five five five six four years I can make that a little bigger so the the total we referred to in the earlier discussion was 175 million 175 692 you subtract out the 620,000 from the housing authority has to pay the town's portion is 16 million 555,000 650 so so going to OPEB the total value that we have right now is 23 million and this just shows the gain in the last year let me make this a little smaller here so so the net liability in OPEB right now is about 194 million I think that's what Andy just mentioned and in the so I mentioned the non-contributory retirement fund number of years ago Al Tassi was noticing that that we were paying the retirees 600,000, 700,000 a year and they were because of their age they were becoming deceased and falling off that demand for contribution so what we worked out was a plan to freeze that expense level at 500,000 dollars and as the retirees passed on we took the money that was not that was no longer being distributed to those retirees because they were deceased and put that money into the OPEB trust fund so 500,000 dollars of that contribution that we made is associated with that policy secondly in 2007 the select board increased the contribution to the health insurance by retirees from 10% to 15% and there was a great deal of consternation and negotiation and the agreement was that the town would contribute an additional 155,000 dollars a year to the OPEB fund in compensation for the retirees increasing their personal contribution to the health insurance and then as a result of the recent override commitment the selectmen agreed to 150,000 dollars so the amount that will be in the Warren article when it comes out is going to be 105,000 dollars questions none done</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so as you mentioned Charlie the unfunded liability going forward it's not really an exact science I'm sure they remeasure it every year depending on the market and also I guess our payroll and our hiring does it seem like it actually has gone down the last 3-4 years, I'm trying to figure it out but I don't really have any good historical records somewhere here I think It's not here, it's in the attachment set, right? It's on his card. He's got 12, by 12 votes. Oh, but that's for the OPEB. Yeah. Is that what your question was? I was actually talking about the pension. Yeah, let's see. I don't know if we can look at it. I'm looking at the financial statements, and it looks like, I don't know if I'm looking at Apples and Apples or whatever out of the ordinary, but it says total net pension liability at December 31, 2021 is $95 million, which seems very low. That means it shot up from $95 million in 2021 to $118 million. So it's kind of low. Can you look in the other documents that I sent out that history was in there? When 2020 to 2021, we experienced a larger than average number of people leaving town employment. Leaving. So paying for retirement. So that would be, so in other words, that would increase either payees, or payees, or recipients. Yeah. So I'm just curious, if the number I'm looking at is correct, that means that it's not necessarily going up? It's complicated because, as Charlie alluded to, you've got varying amounts on all sides of the equation. Net asset value, net cost. So that's why the presentation begins with something basically like the tedious details of what is the age profile of our employees? And what's the age profile of our current retirees? I can't calculate it. I think my future son-in-law makes a business out of it. I think I have to stop my screen sharing and start again. So this is, there's a document, the entire document from Stone Consulting is in the appendix, and it's on the SharePoint. So this, these two charts show the history of assets and the unfunded liability from 2005 to 2023. The unfunded liability is in purple, and the, I lost track, which is called the assets, the accurately found assets. That means it's because it's using a smooth curve that we talked about earlier. Got it. So yeah, this is great. So the entire bar represents our liabilities. So it looks like the point for the liability is kind of sneaking up close to $150 million. You know, get it paid. And then the shaded part, the shaded part is the unfunded liability. So you can, you know, it's getting better. Yeah, visually, it seems like it's getting smaller. Yeah. Yeah, you can see the run up in the general stock market beginning in January of 17 that was dramatic. Yeah. You can also see the OA drop. Yep. Which is not as bad as it felt at the time. Yeah. Right there. Yep. In hindsight, everything looks better. I don't know. That was so much smaller in 2007. Can I get back to the other? Well, I'm just going to point out that doesn't include, so this is great through 23. Doesn't include 24, 25. Well, that's because you don't get the data until about a year later. Yeah. So this brings us then past the OFED to the last slide, which is a recommended vote. I hesitate to make this recommendation. I'm so confused here. The numbers are too big for me. It's OK. You're safe. So the amount, including the housing charges, about $17,175,692. Take that out of $16,556,550. And the taxation reduced impact due to our offsets of $14,944,696. So I would like to move that we approve $16,555,650 less the offset for the taxation contribution, but doing it so that we have approved the appropriation that is required by the Tariff Act. So I made that motion to last forward. Second. Any questions for the discussion?</blockquote>

It's historically been directed towards the town side as opposed to the town and the school, except that in 2022, we set aside almost a little more than $1 million to cover the potential increase in student growth, which didn't occur, so we didn't use the money. And this is for? It's 1% of the budget, more or less. And that's been a policy? And that's been a policy. For unexpected emergencies. And to the extent that the Reserve Fund is not used, it goes back into free cash, and it eventually circles its way back into revenue. So do you have a motion?

And then 22 and 23 are showing a zero for both those years. Is that accurate? I don't recall spending any money for the Reserve Fund next year. That's what we did. We used to do a lot of snow money, but we need to solve that somehow or another. I can't remember what you did. For now, the budget being more realistically snow and ice. We're budgeting at roughly 75% to 80% of a rolling tenure average of actual costs. So instead of just, I guess what we used to do is we used to budget snow and ice for $100,000, even though we would pay $1 million or $2 million, and then make it up through this. Now, we don't have to make up such a big gap. And when the town clerk was saying she's going to need probably money for the election, that it's going to come from here or do you vote?

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. And someone may have explained this earlier, but I might have missed it. So this year, we're budgeting $2 million for this reserve fund. And then if it's not used, if we don't need this money, at the end of FY25, does it go to free cash or does it go to like a stabilization type fund? Like a balance sheet? It goes to free cash? OK. And then our policy is to use it. So it doesn't get certified for another year. The problem is we don't have it available for another year because free cash doesn't get certified until sometime in September. So in that following year, it goes into free cash. And traditional policy policy has been to bring in half of the free cash as revenue in the budget. And the other half goes to a stabilization?</blockquote>

Because those are pretty significant numbers. Do they even go through our budget, or do they just? Yeah, they go through our budget. They do? They don't go through the operating budget. But we will have warrant articles to put money into them or take money out of them, depending on what year we're in. This year, we'll have a warrant article to put a bunch of money into the overhead stability. Select board, I believe, as a committee, to maintain any aggregate in those reserve funds, something on the order of 5% of the annual budget. And that may go above that, but it won't go below that.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commence. Does anyone have any other budgets for tonight? I do. It's over. Go for it. Can you share it? Yeah. Sure. What are we doing? I take it. We should fund it. Let me just download this so I can make it bigger. 35. All right. All right. All right. So IT. So next slide. So I met with Tricia Shepard, the CIO, a couple days ago and went through this. Next, they have the IT budget itself. It's in the book on page 35. I'll just show you that. We'll come back. The way I'll talk about this is the positions and then the various projects. Then I'll go back to some of these line items. So the next slide is just the budget change. Essentially, it's gone up by almost $50,000. Tricia said basically anything that was left over went to the DPW building project. She says they are going to be doing DPW and IT will be moving to DPW. She said this budget is pretty tight. Just a general overview. Going to the positions on the next slide. Good news here. The manager of enterprise applications, while it says vacant in the budget book, has been filled. So they just started. So they have a full roster. She says, though, I asked, you know, are there other projects you wish you could get to? And she said not. With the current staff, they are pretty maxed out on what they can do. A note, a couple notes here, just salaries here, just on the town share, a dozen more in the schools that are not in this budget, obviously. And then this happened last year, but the manager of GIS moved from IT to DPW back last year. So the projects, she said her highest priority is getting to the modernized GIS project. The current system is actually based on Microsoft Access. She said it can't connect to the new inspectional applications and permitting systems. So trying to get that figured out is working with the GIS manager, the DPW has to do that. Jumping at those questions. Cyber security. Go back one. So this I know is a hot topic. As Jim Feeney mentioned, they've got a grant from the state for training. It uses this Know Before training platform. It's pretty simple to use. So it's a good way for people to just get trained on. Don't click that link. Don't write your password. You know, your password shouldn't be his birthday. It's just content. When you hear grant, it's like, oh, how much money? But it's actually just access to this content. The 5K that they mentioned is for what they call penetration testing. And five weaknesses. So there's many more aspects to this than just that. That's what's happening. She did mention they have a password policy for the schools and they're producing their in one for the town side. And another way to do cyber security is to start moving things. You move your servers to the cloud. Well, basically it becomes the cloud providers problem. They have a lot of money to spend on that. So that's what's currently planned. There's more stuff planned. I don't know how much we want to get into everything on camera, but that's what's happening this year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to, okay, so Microsoft, this is the license breakdown. So essentially, there are some additional licenses. They've also moved some things around that from the online only, they've moved into the middle category, and they moved some frontline workers into this little category. And so this is an increase from last year because there's additional licenses, but some of this too is, G3 is more secure than G1, so that was part of the motivation for that. And she did mention that, you know, VIMCOM kind of spearheaded the whole movement. She's very grateful for that. Thank you very much, that was before my time. Next, Munis. So there's a steering committee. Charlie covered the EDA's work, the comptroller's office. She did, Patricia said, yeah, you pretty much specified what they wanted to do. IT is help. They have a new parking system up and running. And for the question of, from Alan about, you know, are we going to do more financial stuff but get away from Excel help, they would like to do cap, general building and capital planning. So that's not this year. These upgrades happen about twice a year, which they try to keep up with. And they do, in fact, a big upgrade this summer, but then a rewrite of the financial module coming after that. So she's encouraging people like Alex to go to the Munis conference this year to start covering what's happening. So I think the net of that is we're slowly moving to take full advantage of this. Yeah, what does new parking system up and running, is that for parking revenue received, fines levied? I don't know the details. I think it is probably all of the above. I mean, we've got new meters. I expect we'll have information on the new parking. Thank you. Also true. Digitizing documents. So this is the inspectional services, the processes and forms. Instructional services, like, you know, is very happy with the, this is automating the app. One side of this is automating the applying for permits and getting stuff done. Other side of it is if you want to go look things up, it does seem like you'd have to click a lot more things than that, there can be some improvements to that, because you sort of just see a list of, you know, unintelligent IDs, basically, of what the permits are, not even a date on it. You click into it, and then you see a ton of metadata, including the date, broad brief description, and then all kinds of other stuff you probably don't want to look at. And then you can then get to files associated with it, hitting the tab. But, you know, and then you can actually see, you know, the scans of the permits and things that you might be expected to see in the old system. But it is, you know, I think they can continue to configure it. It is fairly new, it's just come online. And it was retired a system that was based on Linux and Perl. So that will be advisable. And I asked, you know, what comes next? And she's hoping like vital records would be next, but you've got to have the town clerk involved. So the town clerk is interested, she wants to digitize this year. Okay, so that might, so they'll just have to make that happen next year. She also mentioned, you know, minutes and agendas could be another thing to get into the system. But I think it's still, it's underway now, but in total, in five or six years, it's going to be hard to get it digitized. Charlie, I think you had a question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, thank you. So I told her, was there any mention of the town hall basement? Oh, you mean, what's in the town hall basement? Well, there are probably 100 years worth of records there that are going to be eaten by the rats. And the town has been talking about both the liability and solving that problem, probably for 25 years. Back when Nansko Kowsky was the deputy town manager. Yeah, there was no, we did not cover none of that. I can ask you. Well, I just wonder, I mean, it's great. The digitization that they're doing is great stuff. But I believe that there is a state law that says this material has to be preserved and made available. In some form. Is that more than the vital records? I don't know. I think it's, I don't know what it was. I guess when we remember when we spoke with Julia, she mentioned obviously, being very interested in digitizing the vital records and mentioning the basement. So maybe that's so maybe that will be addressed. Some portion of the basement. I mean, that's the that's the question. I may not be able to know what story that is. It's also a fire hazard. It's one of those enormous problems that no one even wants to start. But it needs to be done in small pieces. Capital Planning Committee, on several different occasions, authorized money to do that. And nothing was done. Different, different quirk. Also, you know, the leak in the ceiling will put the fire out, Charlie. The joining has been clear for four years. I forgot.</blockquote>

And as we've talked, I mean, I think, as Jim said in his mail, you know, the management of the data is done externally. And Patricia did mention an interesting thing, just for disaster recovery. This is a redundant network. So this could potentially be used for that, which would be a win win. Can't be needed. Oh. And then other projects, obviously, it's the new construction that's continuing to do stuff with Grove Street and tech infrastructure or equipment in high school, but those are the projects. And so with that, the questions I'll go on to the individual budget items.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have any. And so one question about Grove Street. Am I correct that all of their equipment and so on and so forth is on a higher floor at Grove Street? It's not in the basement. I don't know. So you mean the I.T. stuff or all the heavy equipment? I.T. stuff, a bomb, blood. Yeah, yeah. I understand why you're asking. I wasn't sure if you meant just the I.T. stuff. I just mean all the furnaces and all the computers and so on. OK. I think the flood disaster, Charlie mentioned, was in the high school end of the computer lab, so certain rooms. Because it wasn't an alone floor. No, I get it. So be so when APS projects, is that the tech infrastructure that came to the school budget as to the school, does the school budget have their own I.T. stuff? Or is that all covered by the. The school does have some I.T. stuff. I think their employees are in their budget. There's 12 employees in their budget. I mean, some of it would be capital. I was just curious to see that on other projects, because I would have thought any projects within high school would be in those schools. Well, I think it's that it involves some types of fees. Yeah, it's a joint I.T. department. So she manages the I.T. staff on both sides. And then you mentioned this, but it's on the network maintenance, the actual that was very high for twenty twenty three by fifty two. Did you say that's DPW related or? I'll get to that. I'm going to go. OK, all right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, Charlie's jump. Yes. Thank you. What is the disaster recovery? Plan or protocol that they have in place? I don't know the details, but I can find out if they have. I know they've had some disaster. OK, I asked part of the capital plan. I think they said they're developing. OK, that's right. It was in your. I just mentioned relevant to that, I recall in many, many audits by powers and Sullivan, one of the action items was lack of a disaster I.T. disaster. I think it was triggered by a flood in the high school. And a few years ago, the auditors said that it had been satisfied. There was this under David Good. There was an adequate disaster plan. So we know one exists. I don't know the details, but at least it exists sufficiently to satisfy the auditors. I had to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so moving on. So the various line items. So I asked, can I get a maintenance as opposed to software maintenance? And it's basically server warranties, which would be decreased as people search the cloud, which we would do for cybersecurity as well. And is that a disaster recovery? General. Staff. Next is the telephone expenses. There's a seven K decrease in this due to retiring central lines. They use RCN for land and Verizon mobile lines for the work mobile phones. And then on the next page is just a breakdown of the telephone charges, which were, you know, 13K for Verizon and 28,000 for RCN. Fairly basic stuff. Training really split, you know, 10K for the MUNIS conference and 10K for professional development for the staff. They use the skills training platform, which allows them to access content. And she just did emphasize that a lot of staff goals involved as they've got to stay current. And she herself got a certificate in management leadership which I think hit last year's budget. But she graduated since we met. And then consulting was basically, I asked what are those costs for? And she said it was cable and wiring for the new building for the DPW building. So I closed. Other purchase services, what was that? And I said that was she said some job postings. And then this was kind of weird to me, but she had to pay for furniture for their new offices in the DPW building because it got value. And she said I had to buy furniture. I had to help some of those people sit. So that's what she did. And finally, network maintenance came up, and that's just the software cost. And it includes all kinds of things, the Comcast, the web licenses, backups, Arcuda, firewall, and some work on, I guess, the DPW renovation. And last is everyone, Informix. So, yes, Munis is building up the data, but not all the water meters are converted. It was supposed to be done in December 2023, but supply chain, the usual gremlin, they were saying, and DPW, she said they need access to the system for longer. They still need to be able to look at the old stuff, and that requires Informix. And the budget is $4,400, not the $7,000 that's in the budget book. Jim had mentioned as well. So, yeah, we just, it's a little bit of Zeno's paradox here. We keep getting half the distance maybe to getting rid of this, but it's still, I mean, she just said it really, they have to keep it until this goes off. And I said, so wait, you know, are you going to get every last water meter fixed? Because, I mean, you know, that's going to take forever. There'll be people that you just don't get to or whatever. She didn't think it was that far, but it has to be fewer of them than there are now. And I don't know, DPW, they have no information at all. They're concerned. I was going to ask about just where they think it is and how key it is. And, yes, thank you. So, Topher, you mentioned the telephone system. Is the entire telephone system now on the IP network or are they still using? There's still some landlines. They're not all retired. I'm not, you know, that doesn't say they're not landlines, but are they, are they time division multiplexed or are they packet switched? So you're asking if they're on a voice over IP? Yeah. Okay. I think they are, but I'll double check. The reason I ask is that there was a tremendous amount of cost of maintaining these copper wires between the buildings or the traditional telephone connections. And I don't know, I think they might've taken all those switches out. I don't know what the. Yeah. I'll double check for you. Questions? So back to the network maintenance. So what was the actual, why was the actual so high in 2023? On network maintenance right over. Oh yeah. I don't know. Cause the previous year was hardly anything. Yeah. It might've been a problem. I'm just curious. Cause going back in the book a few years, that's just, yeah. I can follow up on these. That'd be good. You can also mail them in for me ahead of time. Oh, now, not everybody is you. So with that, I will move the IT minor, minor, minor, but things like a computer paper that's been, that's just been bundled under supplies now, along with supplies. Now, along with that, I assume that's papers. Yeah. Computer paper. They don't spend it. I'm sure they do. It's supplies and affairs. They don't even budget anymore. So it just combined. Yeah. It looks like that's just been thank you. Anything else? Great. So I moved the taxation total of $1,250,429.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any further questions for TOPA on IT? So what was that number again? Um, 1,250,429. What about the 2,400 that, uh, Informix got reduced? What do you mean 2,600 less or that reduced the total you mean? Yeah. I, it seems like the expense budget should be reduced by 2,600. Unless it got shifted. Yeah. I don't think it got shifted because it's still saying 7,000 or you might want to move a new number. So when we have this late information, what we do, because the budget book says this, they didn't send a new sheet. To do, we just subtract 26. We want to just go up to I mean, you know, if you're sure of that reduction, yeah, no, that reduction. I mean, we heard about it from both sources. I get one, two, four, seven, eight, two, nine. Yep. One, two. All right. So why don't we, we'll move that. Oh, a little over a million, $1,247,821. That's 320. 1,247,821. This has been a motion for one, two, four, seven. 8 to 9. That's been seconded. Second. Any questions? All right. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? All right, Topher, if you could just confirm that number. Yeah, I will. Or I'll let her know that she'll be voted on. Confirm with Alex as well. All right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any other budgets for tonight? I think we're really being extremely productive. I just want to get a sense from people as to when they might be able to have budgets ready. So I'll just go down the list, human resources, I think we have to wait for Carol and treasurer postage. Brian's to me. Second, I heard anything from Brian. No. If you want to go ahead with them. And I can push ahead with those. I guess June for treasurer. I talked to. Yeah, you could do that. Great. And the same with. Who's doing parking Brian and Carol. Are you. So, you can see that see if you can touch base with Brian, if not, then take it upon yourself to start moving the ball there. Okay. So, I'm going to move on to the next item. And that is public work. That's going to be a while. I know that. Yeah. So we. We scheduled facilities and public works for the last week of February. So I'm not actually the second to last week of February. We're meeting with facilities on the 20th. And DPW the 23rd. And then. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But we do have. Waste confirmed for this Friday. So I know there's be lots of questions on that from people, so they should get them to us soon. Yeah. We know the obvious questions, but if there's anything that, you know, Isn't sort of the obvious of what we're doing and how the negotiations are going and so forth. Please get them to us. Yeah. Okay. Get your questions to Jordan and Jennifer. Right away because as they say, they're meeting with the department heads and. So this will avoid going back and forth. So. Get your questions. So maybe sometime in the first two weeks in March, maybe we'll have budgets. Ready. Yeah, I think that's a good thing to target. Absolutely. Okay. So we'll have to wait for the end. Here's the schedule. 21st of March. Okay. And the reclassified. The schedule for the 20th of February. When's insurance. 21st of March. So we'll have to wait. After that. Well, March 21st is the Thursday. Yeah. So if that's all. It's going to come out. We wouldn't meet again until the 25th. Which is when the schools are coming. So that may be problematic. Yeah. Yeah. And the water. Right afterwards. Yeah. Finish with the school. Wrap things up. So. We'll have to talk about that. Insurance number. No, they say, you know, mid March, March 7th or something, but. By recollection, it's never really better. Usually. So. And capital is coming in on March 6th. And. And minimum 11. Right. I think that is. Budgets now that we have to deal with four articles. And the committees and commissions. So. You want to talk about the warrant? Right now, I just skimmed over the warrant. Someplace over. New Jersey. But. One piece of good news at 67 articles, which is. You know, it's not the lowest we've been, but it's, it's not bad. So. I need to talk to the selectman's office tomorrow. About redoing the order. Towards the end. Cause we always want to have the override stabilization fund. To be the last article that we financial article we deal with. I'm going to try to have. I'm going to. I'll try to have copies. To Tara by. Monday. Okay. Maybe with a little walk on Monday, we could. Review the warrant. Okay. And I think we'll need to have the time manager come in for a couple of them. I'm sure. Yes. So. I can touch base with him as to availability, But we're definitely on for president's day night. No, no, no. This coming Monday is. Well, the 12th. So we'll meet the 12th to go with the. Warrants. We might have some committees. Missions that we can. Put votes on. And. We'll follow up with controller. And within a information tool for you with it. We won't meet on the 14th. And. I'm thinking we won't meet on the 21st either. So. I'll make a final decision about the 21st by then. But it seems like. We have stuff to do on Monday. And then everything else we'll have to wait. So. So we'll meet on Monday, the 12th. No meeting on the 14th. Probably no meeting on the 21st. And then we'll reconvene on the 26th. Yeah. Okay. So we'll have presence week free. And we'll have Valentine's day. And then when we get back on the 26th, then we will. I want to finish everything. You haven't officially canceled the 21st. I will officially cancel the 21st. I want you to know if there's a problem with the worm. Okay. All right. And Tara is chasing down the boards and commissions. You're dealing with art. And he's dealing with arts and culture. Yeah. Yep. So we need to do with them. I don't know if their budget request is the same, right? I don't know if they're asking for more money. If the answer is no. Then we don't need. And that's the same with all of them. And that's the same with all. We're not going to bring the disability in. If they're not. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll be on it. And we're still trying to schedule water bodies and the community preservation. And so she'll have a date for us. Do we have a time for the. Maybe preservation. No. Tara's working on that. And I checked. And you said this. Second for the. Capital is. Okay. So the capital planning is March 6th. Wednesday. Man is Monday. March 11th. The schools will be coming in Monday, March the 25th. And I'm hoping the 25th will be our last. Real meeting. And that we were just that we can finish everything by that night. And if need be. We'll have another meeting after that. I think we're, we are in good stead. So I think, I think we can, we can do that. The only issue that I think would be insurance. See what we can do. Anything. Anyone have anything else? All right. We have a plan. I emailed Charlotte about the. Restaurant pilot. Oh, yeah. Email back to me was we have connected with a technical assistant. Nonprofit and with their help. We are starting the outreach process. Somewhat in coordination with zero waste, single and plastic. Which makes sense to me. Have a staff person. 14 girls. Yeah. Single use plastic reduction initiatives. I think what that means is. How long it is taking a project done and she's pursuing it. Does that make sense? Which makes sense to me. Have a staff person. 14 girls. And presumably. She had this technical team for something else. Anyways. Also do this outreach. Nothing's really happened yet. But. All right. Yeah. All right. So. We can be on Monday. Then on the 26th. Okay. All right. Salute. All right. Thank you.</blockquote>
