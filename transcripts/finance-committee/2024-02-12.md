I mean, an issue right now with this, why there is. Okay, sorry say that again item to January 29 minutes motions we consider. January 29, 24 minutes passed unanimously motion to amend minutes. When asked, yes, and I have three controller, a new chart of accounts has been created. Budget is postponed pending further further investigation of salaries. I think it works. Okay. And does anyone have any other revision to the minutes of February 7? Anyone come up to speak. I mean, the, as the track record, they're waiting to get that. Um, was there some of the remote on Wednesday? Okay, I have a motion to approve the minutes. All in favor say aye. I'm in abstain. So I'll raise your hand for yay.

<summary>2. Review Budgets</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 17</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so we had two budgets to revisit tonight. Um, let's start with the controller budget.</blockquote>

</details>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Controller Budget</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 494</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I take it early? Yes. You want to put it up? Yes, thank you. Just go to slide 3, please. Okay. This is the adjusted one, right? We say, uh, you know, I know. You 7, um, says adjusted. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Okay. Um, is anyone else who's being able to see it? Mine opened up the same. It opened the same way? Yeah. Okay. Let me, let me just re-download it. There must be something wrong with the file. Um, Okay. So, uh, Christine, why don't we go on to somebody else? I almost have it. I'm sorry. It's, um, it's just so slow. It's telling me to close things to save resources. Just give me one second. No, it's just because the wifi is not great in here. But if some of us come off of the wifi, will that help? Okay. Okay, there we go. Okay. So, um, if you go to slide, start at slide three, uh, this says the original budget and, uh, two little, um, notes there and the base salary is wrong. Uh, it was in the book. It should have been, uh, 1 4 8 0 1 3. Um, cause there's been no change since last year. And, and the result was that, um, the new salary was shown higher than the allowed max in the second schedule of the second group of your schedule. And that's just shown on the next page, page four. So, um, page five just shows the original budget. Uh, we talked about the expenses and so forth. Okay. So on page six, um, shows the adjusted salary budget and, um, the new pay can't be any higher than a 1 48 7 0 5. And we had a step in the, in our erroneous budget last week of 692. That was the correct amount, but it was, it was adding to the wrong base. Um, so the new pay is 1 48 7 0 5, which is the max of the group. And if you go to, um, page nine, you have an updated department budget. Which has a recommendation of 32,000, I'm sorry, 30, 362,370 dollars with the adjustments in salary corrected and just discussed. So, um, I'm recommending that the, uh, all this budget be approved 360,000, 370. I will note that I had a conversation with, uh, Alex McGee in, and with Karen, uh, Maloy, and, um, they will, there will be some adjustments to the M schedule to accommodate some of the changes that they originally anticipated. There are perhaps other people in the M schedule that have similar limitations that couldn't, um, so that we'd not be able to receive the formula that they're planning to issue once the, uh, once the, uh, collective bargaining, um, discussions are settled. Is there a second to that motion? Second. A final taxation number after the offsets is 362,370 dollars. 353,370? No, 362,370.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alan Jones - 19</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allen Jones. The last thing you mentioned about adjusting the M schedule, will that be in this year's reclassification?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 22</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I said, I assume that's the case. I mean, we haven't had a reclass meeting, but that's the, that's FY 24.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alan Jones - 111</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Can I reply to that? Yes. Um, so there's, there's two discussions going on, and when we have our reclass meeting, I'm asking Alex to join us. It's actually not a union. It's a manager's, town manager's, um, discretion raised, and so everyone should check their salaries for their managerial staff to make sure the new salary is not above the max salary, because what usually happens then is the max, the difference ends up in the salary reserve, and then gets added after town meeting, because town meeting has to approve the manager's increase in salary. They're supposedly getting, Charlie, was it a two percent or a three percent?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 14</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they wouldn't discuss that because they won't discuss it until after the election.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alan Jones - 95</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that's right. Okay, that's right. Um, so, so all of that has to happen, and so money, my understanding is, and I'm going to make Alex and, um, Karen describe it in full at our meeting, is that the anticipated salary will go into salary reserve. Town meeting will vote on the budgets. They'll vote on salary increases, and then that money will exist, and it will appear with a new M class max next year, and their, their new total, which is above the current max. Does that make sense to people? Yep.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Charles Foskett - 171</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie, does, is that what? Okay, go ahead. Okay, what happens if the collective bargaining agreement is not agreed upon by next year? I'm just thinking about managers here, not collective bargaining, so. Well, I mean, but it's based on, I think the practice has been that they won't make a change in the next year. Oh, no problem to allow for all these? Well, I mean, that's historical. I raised the question because some of these bargaining units, it's gone on for three or four years. Yeah, right. So, you're giving me another question for Karen and Alex. I mean, I wasn't saying that this is going to absolutely change that way. I was just saying that was their discussion. Any other questions? So, I think we need a second. So, if there are no other questions, let's take a vote. All in favor of approving the controller's budget at 62370, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Sophie. Yeah, thank you, Sophie.</blockquote>

<summary>IT Budget - Revote</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christopher Heigham - 158</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing is to open the 19th. Yeah, so there's a revote that we need to do. I also do have a few updates on some of the items. The floor is yours. So, we hope we got the new IT sheets sent out by Alex McGee. What happened was the manager of enterprise applications, which was vacant, was fired late, just started either January 31st or the 1st of February for both dates, and they had to hire them in at a higher salary than was the placeholder. So, this is Alan catching something last week about this, and so we will need to vote the new total. So, so, with the adjusted sheet, the taxation total changes to $1,255,953. There's an $8,124 difference in what was budgeted earlier versus what they had to actually pay. So, that's the new taxation total. So, I'm going to, before we vote that, should I just go through this?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christopher Heigham - 502</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, you would also ask someone to ask about the parking system. That turns out there's going to be more information coming from the treasurer, because they drove that. So, once I've met with Julie, I'll have an update on that. As far as the records in the town hall basement, IT pointed out that they digitized things in the order that they've kind of been told to. They don't make the ordering decision. I've asked Jim Feeney about what he thinks might be the next order of business, but I have not heard that. So, that's still outstanding. The 10k service and maintenance costs for the body cam line going forward, she thinks Patricia said she's going to ask to put that in the network budget going forward. FY26 and beyond. Any questions so far? Good. The IT equipment in the server room is on the second floor, so it is not in the basement. So, you would ask about that. The disaster recovery plans, I did have Tara Ford in email that Patricia sent. I'm not going to read the whole thing to you because it's several paragraphs, but I think the upshot is they're aware of it. They are putting plans together. They've done some exercises on it. So, we lose the building that the server room is in. What do we have to do? Yeah. So, they are looking into that. Charlie, you asked if there are any more copper wire. All the Centrix lines have been removed. She said there might be some POTS lines on the school site for a building wire, but that's it. So, we have gotten rid of the copper. And then, finally, the network maintenance item. There were several questions on about this. The first that Sophie, you brought up was why was the budget book, why was it different? Why was the FY23 budget one number in the FY23 budget book and then another number in the FY24, and it was because there was an additional, there was an appropriation in town meeting that was the second number that happened after the FY23 book came out. But he did say that that matches what's in the image. So, I think we solved that. The large amount of the actual of the network budget of 131, 431, basically salary savings in IT was used to fund the network spend for the DPW's growth screen project. And it was used for networking. So, it's not really, so, you know, given the bottom line budgeting that we do, the bottom line number didn't change. They just used some savings in one place to do the other. And then, finally, there's a 10k increase in the FY25 budget, and that's the data line for the light station. So, I think we'll find out about the digitization of records. I'll stay on that, and I'll have more, like I said, on the treasurer's budget. But I think that covered all the questions that got asked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Any other questions that anyone has right now? First, I'd like a motion to reconsider our previous vote, right? So moved. Second? Second. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? All right. We're now reconsidering the taxation total of 1,255,953. I have a second. Second. Any further questions? All right. All in favor, say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Unanimous. Yes. Thank you. Does anyone have any budgets for tonight? You have something?</blockquote>

<summary>Snow and Ice Budget</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jordan Remy - 871</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we can do snow and ice tonight. All right. What better time to do snow and ice? Do you have things you want to share? I just have a couple just my notes here. I can share it out with you if you'd like. So just a quick reminder about how we do snow and ice. So the budget that you see for fiscal year 2025, that's, we take the amount between 75 to 80% of the town's 10-year rolling average to come up with that number. And as a refresher, this is the one budget that we would actually be allowed to deficit spend. but we've taken what many municipalities do do, but we've taken the approach to try to have more of an accurate representation so that we have a fully funded budget and we're not looking to do either line item transfers or trying to make up the money at town meeting every year. So this number generally comes in pretty close to what we actually budget for each year. So this year, year to date, we've spent about $546,000 across five events. One was the first storm that we had was a heavy plow, but most of what we end up spending our money on is salt and sand. So some other large, some large picture items. I know contractors have been difficult over the past few years to try to get. We checked with Mike and there are currently about 10 vendors who can supply about 50 trucks to us. Most of our in-house staff are actually plowing themselves. Salt and sand is typically done by our in-house staff, but there is one vendor who's available to us in case we were to ever need any extra salt or sand capacity. Getting to the vendors. So costs on vendors have risen about 30% for the fees that they are charging the town for us to use their services for. There was a question that came in about what's the incentive that we're offering to vendors to try to get them interested in plowing for us. And that was the $3,500 incentive. It's basically ensuring that there's a base for the vendors so that every year it's not, there's a guarantee that you're not going to lose money out when you come and you plow for us. So you'll at least the $3,500 that generally covers about what it would cost for somebody to be insured for their trucks. So they get that even if they don't touch or plow. Correct. And it's like, the way that Mike explained it to me, it's that you're guaranteed the $3,500, but when you plow with us, you'll make up that amount. So essentially it's, you're not going to be losing money out on us, but you do kind of earn it. I hope I'm explaining that well. It's a floor incentive. Exactly, it's a floor. That's a great way to think of it. And apparently this year we've already reached it, so it's not flowing. No one's getting a freebie. Right. So they get the $3,500 if they only plow $1,000 worth of flowers. If they plow $5,000 worth of flowers, they get $5,000 because they've already earned it. Got it. Exactly. And Mike's pretty confident that the amount of vendors that we have right now, he's comfortable in working with. He thinks that that should be an adequate number to be able to cover the town. We're meeting again with EPW on Friday. We'll let you know if he thinks otherwise, but I think they're pretty comfortable in their snow operations. And he seems to be, I think that he's confident that they're going to be able to make it this year. And I know that they're also, did we touch base on it? I think we, yeah, we touched base on it when we met with them too, about how we're trying to become a training incentive to try to train people to drive. Yeah, we'll go over that some more with EPW. But anyways, yeah, I think snow and ice is pretty well covered and he's confident that this budget should last them for the remainder of the year. Just a couple more things. So he also mentioned that salt is also kind of dramatically. So it's both salt and iron people have gone up by 30%. So we've had a couple of years of lower snow numbers, but we're still spending, maybe as much as we spent years ago with higher sand numbers because of the fixed amount. And then one other thing I realized is I know that we are left deficits that send and that we can make transfers. He said, generally we don't do that. So if they spend an extra 200,000, they would make it up elsewhere rather than go to 10.5. It's only when those really, really bad snow events happen that we have to cut this. Questions, Topher. So I was just gonna say the flip side of a guaranteed pay is that if we call them, they have to come, right? So if we had a really big storm season, they're on the hook to be plowing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other questions, Sophie. Do we historically always just budget one global number and then in the actual see the breakout or do we ever budget per thing? Just curious. We asked my dad and he didn't know why. He's like, hmm, I don't know. It's always just whenever and then in the actuals we see the breakout.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christine Deshler - 167</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Other questions? This is maybe for you. Do you know when the last time is we appropriated a snow and ice deficit? Yeah, that was 2015. Yeah, that was a $2.3 million spend. Yeah, yeah. That's the apocalypse. Yeah. Yeah. That was the only real victory we've had. That was- It's also one of the reasons- It's always working. Yeah. Yeah. It's also one of the reasons we increased the reserve fund. Right. And ruling out was very, very close to the budget. But only because we've been lucky to have certain low expenses. Other questions? All right. So, Jordan, Jennifer, do you have a motion? We have the motion to approve the removal of snow and ice budget for $1,172,013. Second. Any further questions? All? I can't speak. It's still going. It's still going. It's fantastic. All right, if you have a motion to second, all in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? All right, it's unanimous. Thank you very much for doing snow and ice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything else, anybody else? Vote our budget or else. What? I said vote our budget or we're gonna send out a lot of tickets. Very timely manner. All right, so let's talk minutes. I mean, warrants. Al, you wanna take it from here?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Allan Tosti - 180</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I don't know if anybody has, still Prince Al, got a copy of the budget of the warrant, but let me go through it. I guess the short answer is there's not a huge amount of additional things we need to do, but let me just sort of go through it article by article. The whole bunch of the first articles are all bylaw changes, which are under the authority of the Board of Selectmen. Then it's all the zoning changes and then all the finance. Article seven is a betterment bylaw revision on private ways. And so, Christina, I think when the town manager comes in, we might just wanna ask him what he has in mind here, because anything that's not covered by the assessments, somehow it impacts us. I don't think it's not a finance article, but directly, but I think we should ask him about it. And just so you know, I confirmed with him that he and Alex will be in to meet with us on Wednesday, March 13th. March 13th for the manager.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 99</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask her a question about that? So, okay. Hold on. Can I ask a question about, so that's a significant expense. They repaved all of Marion Road in my neighborhood so that the buses could get up and down it. So I think it's related to us, unless he's gonna do it within the budget he gets for the year. I mean, the assessments are supposed to be paid entirely by the abutters. So- I don't think that happened on Marion Road, knowing some of the abutters. I suggest you ask the manager when he comes in.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Allan Tosti - 299</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. That's what I suggested. Okay. Eight is the annual town meeting. That's just sort of the flexibility. But nine and 10 are the times. And while that's not a finance article, it's a procedural article that could impact our meetings. Now, over the last few years of myself, Charles and now you, we haven't really had that much to do from 7.30 to eight o'clock. But if this passes and town meeting starts at 7.30, then we might have to start at seven. So that might be something that, and of course that would impact the selectment also. So they might have, sorry, select board. They might have something to say about that, but- And the redevelopment board. I'm sorry? And the ARB. Yeah. So the rest of the articles, I didn't see any particular financial impact. Article 21 is a home rule legislation to amend the senior citizen property tax exemptions. It's been inserted by the board of assessors and has those magic words, or funded by an appropriation or transfer from existing funds. So I think it might be interesting to have the board of assessors or one of their representatives come in and say, you know, what do you have in mind here and how much is this going to cost? Because then they'll say, oh, it doesn't cost anything. It comes out of the overlay. Well, the overlay we use to partially fund our budget. So yeah, it does have a, at least it might not be a big one, but we should understand it. So that's article 21, board of assessors. Okay, then you go through all the zoning articles. I didn't see anything there, which I thought John Mayone is trying to get his Winter Street property back into the MBTA again.</blockquote>

<summary>Warrant Articles - FinCom</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Allan Tosti - 534</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, now we get to the finance articles and probably 90% of them are the same. We do have amendments to the 24 budget. So that's the town manager to find out. Now, last year he put this in and then we didn't make any changes, but we should ask about that. And then the rest of these articles are pretty straightforward. I don't know if you would roll up just a little bit. I saw appropriation for public educational. I'm sorry. Programming from ACMI. Hey, yeah, that's finance. We- Yeah, we- That's standard. Yeah. It used to be that the money we take in would go directly to the cable company, but about four years ago, the department of revenue said, no, that's got to be appropriated. So instead of going directly there, it has to be appropriated. And so that's what that's about. So starting with article 35 on until almost the end, it's our articles we will, we typically report on, but there are a couple of, at least one new one. Article 51, I got to coordinate with the council on aging because they keep putting in the Harry Barber as a separate article and we keep putting it in the committees and commissions. So I think what we need to do next year is add the council on aging Harry Barber program right into the wording of the article 46 commissions and committees. And then I'll talk to them about getting rid of it. I mean, it's not a big deal, but it just an extra article we have to deal with. Now the sort of new ones are article 53, which is the takings of Stratton school safe routes. And this was put in last year, but they ended up not doing something because they weren't ready for the bits and pieces. And so I assume they are, but that'll be something. Now it's community development. So we'd want to ask the town manager about that. I mean, he could bring whoever he wants to. Okay, now you've got the private way repairs revolving funds, which could tie into that revolving fund changes. So I think we need to ask the manager about that. Article 55 is the public library construction program match. We had gotten a grant to fund the Robbins library back in 1988. We were like the first ones. And we got that whole addition to it. It doesn't say Fox in this, but I'm assuming that's what they are referring to. So I was hoping we were talking about this a little bit before. If they can put housing on top of the Fox, they can have a project like we did here back in 1980. We built a police station and a housing project on the same piece of land. I don't know if it's actually attached to each other, but it certainly is close to it. And we got two entities to work together to create a much bigger thing. Perhaps if they can work with the housing authority or maybe the housing corporation, we could have a much more productive project, but we'll see what they said. All right. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why is this in the operating budget, not capital budget?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Allan Tosti and Others - 241</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good question. I don't know. I mean, traditionally, if you have a program plan, it goes in the capital budget. And this is a grant, they have the ability in the capital budget to accept grants in the other category. That's a board of library trustees and the library director. So I don't know if that thought process was at that level. I could, why don't I give Tim Moore a call and see if the capital budget. I don't think he's here. It's Chris Moore. It's Chris Moore. It's Chris Moore, the chair. Oh. But I don't recall them putting an item. We are having the library director in March 4th to talk about this. Okay. So you are a representative on capital budget? Yeah. Oh, so you haven't seen this at all? I don't remember. I'm just looking to see if it's even on the list. Fox library was on the sort of to-do list several years ago. When the library did come to us with a request, I just don't remember anything about Fox. Let me just look at the list. Just an appropriation for the celebration. Yeah. Yeah, so you're right. So it should have gone to you. That could be an issue we raised with the manager also, I suppose. Absolutely. Yeah. We'll have to look. We can talk to the library director on the 4th and the manager on the 13th or whatever it's at.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, article 56 is local option. This is more, it's almost more of a policy. It's just to allow the trust fund commissioners to use the prudent investor rule as opposed to whatever rule they have now on that. So the manager put that forth. My guess is to give them some more flexibility and how they invest trust funds. Do you think this is a finance committee issue though? Do you think the finance committee should weigh in on 56? Did you say yes? Master. Say yes. You say yes, that we should weigh in? I'm sorry, you know. Sorry, did you say yes? My hearing aids just died. Sorry. In a minute. Yes, we should weigh in. She needs to, you need to repeat your question. So do you feel like we should weigh, the finance committee should weigh in on article 56? Or should we wait to talk to the manager? I'd say wait to talk to the manager and just see exactly what you had in mind to do. So Madam Chair. Yes. Can I just, no. So as a legacy item on the committee, when town officials move outside of the investment schedules, we get involved. And so it happened once before, if it happened again, we'd get involved. So I think we should at least hear it. Because if we're setting rules that we may someday have to look at, we should at least see them on the way in. Appropriation master plan update, $50,000 to update the master plan is endorsed. This is by the director. It's his director. So I think we should ask the manager about this. I just had a couple of thoughts in mind. You know, we had a consultant to develop the master plan. And this is just me. I'm wondering if we got the, we should have the resources within planning and community development to update it ourselves. 50,000 seems like a lot of money, but that's just a quick observation. So now, now we're getting into the. the most of the other standard articles. Local option taxes, which is the article we've had in forever, which never gets, we always vote no action because nothing's there, could be slightly relevant this year. The governor has proposed a whole series of revenue raising options for cities and towns. This could be there. What I've heard from the MMA is it's going over like the proverbial lead balloon in the legislature. On the grounds that we just voted, asked the voters and they approved four million dollars of no, four percent of new revenues for the millionaires tax. This is not the time that we're going to vote more taxes for cities and towns. It could be relevant. My guess is the legislature is not going to give it to us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a quick question though. Whatever the budget would be voted for would be until July, so would it not be relevant yet this year because- Well, they've divided up different parts of it. What she proposed to the legislature is not just a revenue, also has other bits and pieces of municipal. It's been divided up between a couple of different committees. So it wouldn't be in the budget, it's a separate bill?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could theoretically see something by the time we have to actually vote on it, but I wouldn't wager a lot of money on it. Then the rest of the articles are the same. A little bit of a difference in the order. Alex, our finance director, asked that the collective bargaining be put at the end after the fiscal stability. I never had a chance to talk to him about it, but I don't have a big problem with that. Hopefully, anything that we have will be voted on before we go to print. If something comes up after we go to print, then we might just have to table 64, which is the fiscal stability fund, do the collective bargaining, and then go back and adjust. Then we have a resolution on MBTA service by one of our favorites, Don Quixotes of our town. All right. Thank you, Al. Any questions, Topher? Yeah, I was wondering about Article 42, the Transportation and Construction Fund. Is that a standard one? It is. The difference is, in the last few years, they've been putting in a dollar amount. It's been like $62,000 or something like that, right down to the penny. This year, they just said a sum of money, but we've done that for at least two years now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. One of the problems with the consent agendas is people don't start focusing on it until the first night, and then they get all uptight. I've suggested, because I'm involved in a lot of this stuff, I suggested to the moderator that maybe do the consent agenda the second day, even though that means we actually have to dispose of a couple articles. And the other thing I suggested is that anybody who yells hold has to get up, identify themselves, precinct, and then say hold. We'll put a damper on some of it, but we'll see. And what I'm going to try to do is get our finance report finished earlier. That's why I'm pushing for everything to be completed by the 25th, because that hopefully will give the three of us the time to work over Easter again and get it done, so that might help that situation. And maybe this year that person has somebody else who he wants to target.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that'd be interesting. Another thing that has been percolating in my mind, and I've spoken to a couple of people, is maybe the finance committee should have a meeting after we've done our business, before town meeting, to educate town meeting members, newly elected town meeting members, or older town meeting members, about what we do, how we created this budget, and then let them ask questions then, so that when we get to the opening night of town meeting, maybe there won't be any holds on some finance issues. But we would need to organize to have that meeting. So I'm kind of curious whether there's some interest among people here tonight to try to do something like that.</blockquote>

We're already rolling. And then when you bring it back, there are meetings over, precinct meetings over. But at that point, we might have the consent agenda. But exactly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a good point. Just as our own panel discussion, and they could broadcast it. I don't know how many times they fit it in, but. Except for what we would like questions. Yeah, that's a problem. Call in numbers. No. Excuse me. Tower on and then Charlie. If we did something like that, we could, isn't there like a new town meeting member orientation? Maybe we, like, isn't there something every year that they do? There has been. Yeah. Yeah, that's probably what they do. Yeah, that's actually. So I wish we felt it on that orientation and we didn't talk about finance, but I don't, you know, there's a lot of other stuff jammed into that. So is there an opening in that type of meeting or a more full discussion about to enable people to ask questions about the budget? So and then that also means the report has to be in people's hands. Yes. It's really more a this is how town meeting runs kind of training, right? You know, this is what these motions mean, et cetera, et cetera. So we can talk when we get back around to considering this year's agenda for that meeting. I can see, yes, that we have an extension of it, possibly for people who want to talk about finance articles or something like that. We have in the past offered a couple of different dates for that training as well. So that and we report it. So let me see what other reports are ready. Are there reports ready by the time we usually don't do that until well after the elections? We don't know who's who. Yeah, so I would think so. We're wrapping up March 25th. We should at least have a draft report ready. Yeah, that could be considered. Right. I would hate to get a draft report out to people and then have a second report out. So it would have to be. And I think people would want it to be close in time to get into town. Well, so let me. See, we'll send you some information about what we did the last two years so that you have an idea what the agenda is and what the timing was, and then we'll determine where I also think the precinct meetings to have value because, oh, absolutely, because, yes, it is for the public, but it is an opportunity for new precinct town meeting members to presumably gather together to hear what happens at these things. And and it might be an opportunity to educate. I mean, they don't usually at those. I always attend mine and we don't get to talk about how town meeting works. We get overrun by. Right. The public wanting to talk about particular articles. Right. So some of those are finance articles to be able to, as Al described, take ten minutes or five or seven minutes and say, I'm from the finance committee and I represent your precinct. And here's the report. You should have it. Here's how we developed it. Here are the main things you need to know this year. And here I am asking questions. And here's my here's my information on the website. Our website, we get the email from all of us. You can you can you can go to the recordings. You can I guess we could if we have a finance committee report online a week and a half ahead of the town meeting in the mail. The week we put in a sheet or I don't know if you want to do this or just names and phone numbers and precincts and say, you have any questions, call your precinct person and try to get it that way. And that way we get to consent agenda, either the first or second night. You know, we can get a lot of most of it done.</blockquote>

As I read that, that just seems like almost a touch up to some legislation that already passed. And I just want to confirm that it's just a touch up and it has no budget implications. But. I don't think that the question was there was an open question, but we want to ask the time after.</blockquote>

I just have to notice it when I went back and looked. I didn't catch it when you mentioned it the first time. Yeah, I just, you know, so many times in the past, we've increased exemptions for this or for that. And we always get the answer. Well, this isn't going to cost anything. Yeah, well, that's called something. And even though number one, it might not cost a lot of money. And number two, it serves a good purpose. It should still be out there. Yeah, I mean, you step back a bit, that whole exemption, my back to the envelope map, it says at most they can't cut the property tax by more than one percent. So, I mean, I'm looking at property taxes, but let's just say 150 million. So if they gave the full rebate or whatever you want to call it, there'll be about a one point five billion dollar offset to our property tax base. And I. Yeah. And the final question, have we heard anything about that? Like, in other words, you know how that will impact property? You know, are they going to give the whole thing out or is that going to be addressed later on? The property tax rebate that was on the ballot this year? Tom Mann, I have to mention that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I believe that that rebate is based on your. I'd be wrong, but I mean, it's based on your income and there's an application. And so it's just a pool of money for people who apply for the rebate based on their circumstances. And then we change. I think money. Yeah, well, the money available is probably pretty consistent, but we change the circumstances to eligibility circumstances. We may have increased income limit or something like that. And I forget exactly what we did. So we we won't necessarily be spending a one point five. OK, so it sounds like less than one point five. So one point five is ceiling. Yeah. And I was just wondering if it's a big budget. It sounds like not necessarily not necessarily in a moment's budget. OK, we have a we have a variety of programs intended to help people and they they never have a budgetary impact that they could if they were maximized. Got it. Yeah. How are you? Oh, no, that was that was before.</blockquote>

It was just a comment going back to meetings and saying that Charlie has always been fabulous at the precinct meetings that I've attended. Always talks and answers questions. Now, if you send me to a meeting to answer questions, it's not going to be the same answers. So you might have to do some internal training before we all feel comfortable for the newbies to go out and answer. But they've always been beneficial. And at least in our precinct, people always ask about financial budgets. And Charlie always gets to talk. So you'd be there with her. Well, but I represent a different person. If I'm like you, I float around. I didn't have Charlie to lead on. I think there's a suggestion that. Well, there often are joint meetings. So and and I if if if you were to show up, let's say precinct 19 and said, you know, I'm from the finance committee. I don't live in this precinct, but I'm here to answer questions. And we could just if we if we want to do that, we can just sort of divvy it up to make sure that somebody, at least one person from here was at a precinct, all of the meetings. So to just be there here, I can talk to you for a few minutes. But I'm here for questions. And here is who you can contact. So just to throw, I mean, I was I'm all for that. And had actually been wanting to do that the past couple of years based on my experience of Charlie speaking at ours. But I'm unsure of myself to do it. So, yeah, I, I, I, yeah, I think you're pretty good with the numbers. I'm surprised we don't know. We won't make people do something that they don't are comfortable with.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean. So actually, it's very good feedback. I was going to say, I think when we talk about transparency and outreach, I think all the ideas are great. What I would say through my professional experience is. Stakeholders, it's amazing. They actually value transparency far more than technical accuracy. Right. So like I always tell people, like I'm on this tour right now at work where I have to present your results to shareholders. And like I emailed to 20 and two asked questions. And the other 18 didn't even open email. I go to like our executive group and like six of them are on their phones. And like, you know, like people are just totally like eyes glazed over, like, please leave. Right. But then they send me these emails months later, like, thank you for being so transparent. And I'm like. You were outside the room on your phone the whole. What are you talking about? Right. But what you learn through experience is like, like to your point, Sophie, it's like when you show up to the meeting and you're like, I'm from the finance community, I'm here to answer your question. And then I don't have any questions. They then go tell people how transparent you were. And you're like, but you didn't ask me anything. Right. And so I think what we do in these regards is it's important to be open to people and available to people. And even if the answer is to a really good question, I'll find out for you. And you're right. Now, let's go back to my computer there. I think whatever we do, just being out there is far more valuable than being technically sound on the answer. Yeah. Amen.</blockquote>

And that brought to mind. Maybe we don't need it. Consent agenda finance, because I recall several years back, I can't remember whether it was John Morton or John Leone, but the moderator. Approach the. Finance committee budget, the town budget by saying, OK, just went through. each number and said, does anyone want to discuss this and put a hold on it? Which is the same thing they do with the consent agenda, but if it happens at the night that you're hearing the Finance Committee budget, you pass the transparency test, as Dean just pointed out. You're not trying to pull a fast one on people the first night of town meeting. You're saying, okay, we're going to open this budget up for discussion, and you find out who wants to talk about it and who doesn't. As opposed to what happened last year, I think a lot of people just raised their hand on different budget numbers because they were, I don't know, out of fear or something like that. And we had to go through those budgets, and then we find out nobody wanted to discuss them anyway. So, I mean, I would argue that we don't need consent agenda for the Finance Committee budget.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josh? Yeah, I think it's been Sophie. I've been at those meetings, and Sophie's asking Charlie all those questions. But I would just echo Michael's suggestion about ACME. I think it's, I mean, why not? And I think it could probably identify some of the things that are likely to be somewhat controversial, and maybe James and Milan could ask some of those questions or something to it, like the department has. We could have a studio audience. We could have a text line for questions. We could have a Facebook page for questions. Lots of ways to send it in while it's happening. And what type of work is that going to require from us? That's the other thing. I don't think it would require any more preparation than we would have for a public meeting, except to be behind a desk when the cameras go on, and maybe stop and retake a point if somebody flunked what they meant to say. And not too much extra work. I mean, you could do it and not record it and say, oh, it didn't go very well. We don't want to broadcast it. We could kind of own it, in a sense, rather than not. So I think that it's a great idea for us to also open precinct meetings. I always go to mine. I think it's a great idea to do something on ACMI for the general public. But if you want to educate new town meeting members, that's a different discussion. They have to vote on this stuff. And so they need to understand the procedure and how the budget's developed and what they do and don't have control over. And that is seriously separate. So I'm not saying don't do all those things. But I don't think it gets us out of training new town meeting members. But that's at your meeting, isn't it? Well, we don't usually train specifically on the finance articles. We train on the process. So if you want us to expand that, I'll see what we can do. But it's a jam-packed hour and a half. And I think I'm the only finance committee member involved with it. Could it be something where we offer an extra half hour that we run? It's not added to your burden in that group? That's what I'm asking. We create our own and then we piggyback on it. Exactly. So we either have a separate agenda item where finance committee members come and answer questions and present information either two hours at a long time, but we can tack it on, or we could do something slightly separate. And I think we'd still get nods. How many town meeting members? Probably we have 30 people. One new town meeting member show up. They're terrified. So they want to go on and find out. It would be helpful for even existing. And existing. There's there's. Instead of. Yep. On day. 10 of town meetings, standing up and asking what is, what is this? Right. Be able to say before. Open town meeting. What is this? No.</blockquote>

It's been pretty close to the start of town meeting the last couple of years, but the week before. So the timing is good for us. But let me go back and my computer and send an email or something like that. Could you remind me? Yes, thank you. Is it on a Saturday or Sunday or is it in the evening? It's usually in the evening.

Maybe one thing we can do a little bit more of is what we do already and add the comments section. At the right under our emotion. And usually just a sentence or two. And I think it probably just takes the wind out of a lot of a lot of discussion, you know, maybe we can expand that a little bit. The select one go too far. I mean, there are things are 20 paragraphs long. A lot of ours, maybe we could add some more comments to some of the other articles, beef them up a little bit, but no more than three, four sentences, Max. Because otherwise they won't read them. It's easier for them to ask questions of town meeting. But maybe we can pull it out a little bit more. And that way they have it, you know, a week before town meeting and there's the answers. Comments. Yeah, I just want to say that it's not always just that somebody not understanding something, but it's this time meeting is one of the opportunities for people have to ask that particular items. Just because there isn't any other opportunities, not the best place to do it, but they're really given any other opportunity to know. For example, or something like that. 90% of the questions on the budgets have really nothing to do with the budgets themselves. There isn't really a good opportunity right there.

It's just to cut down on the questions that could easily be answered, and maybe people aren't even asking for a town meeting because they just aren't comfortable doing that but they want to know. And that too. So, so these are all good ideas, any. We'll find out. Thinking about what we have the options are and I think hardly says all the above format. We'll think some more about it. I want to say that being and I can rephrase the show. That's a good time. How do people feel about the warrant articles about starting town meeting.

I think that as long as the town moderator continues to enforce the rule on when substitute motions have to be on the chairs, starting at 730 has become a largely irrelevant action I mean I've, I've always correlated that pre town meeting finance community committee meeting would have to occur before town meeting, we would need like 48 hours before the town meeting to be on the floor of town meeting. And so, at current in the past, you could wake up on a Monday of meeting and get blindsided by noon that something was going to be on the floor of town meeting that night, that doesn't happen. And because it doesn't happen, there are no urge. There's no way an emergency finance committee committee meeting would have to occur before town meeting, we would need like 48 hours notice that something was coming forward.

In the past we've had more members with small kids. And so in there and that case does more about just trying to get through dinner right and yes, when you think that's been. Yeah, when you think if you, let's just say, if you work in Boston and you don't get out until five, then you have to find your way from home, and then presumably have dinner with your family. Before you go to tell me if I asked me, and then town meeting, and then get home at 1130 11 o'clock. So, for people who have a family who they want to have dinner with.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, so that I think that's, that's it for the warrant, I will have the town manager in and ask questions about what we've covered. And again, that's on the 13th. Scheduling, who, so we're not meeting on the 14th and we're not meeting on either the 19th, the 21st. So, our next meeting will be the 26th. Anyone think they may have budgets on the 26th or the 28th. We can start up. I'm sure I don't know if it's involved that day, but we can speak to that. All right. All right, so that hopefully will be the last week in February. Now I'm right now on March 4. You still playing reclass on yes we can do reclass on March 4, and we could do. I just sent an email out. We could do insurance on the 20th. Is that what the email says. That means that water and sewer can be done on 20th. Insurance numbers to the issue. All right. All right. Oh, we need to send. Karen needs to send you insurance numbers once you tell me. So if you two can just last year. It didn't happen. But they know, I mean I asked them they just never said. We're having a library director on the fourth. Will you be able to do. Yeah, reclass will be the same day as human resources. Okay, so that's back in February. In March, on the fourth on the fourth, the same day as the library. No no no reclass we can do as early as the 29th, right. Not until the fourth after the 29th. We're meeting. February 26. February 28. So, you know, when is the new. It's on the 20th. Of February. You asked about the week of 26. Sorry. I'm a beginning. Well, okay so the library director will be on in on the fourth. Capital planning is the sixth. Minute man is the 11th. I assume we're going to restart the 730. The manager will be in on the 13th and seen it by way people will be in on the 13th as well and so will community preservation. So, should I ask them to come later, or do you want to do them first and then the town manager. Let's do I said, I confirmed eight with them but let's talk to me. The water bodies will be in on the 18th. Right. That's still. That's still happening right Carolyn. Yes. All right. And the schools will be in on the 25th.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you heard from any committees or commissions, yes, I have heard from. I have heard from. So the scenic byways asking for more, and then three others that are not arts and culture not asking for more tourism and economic development not asking for more zero waste Arlington not asking for more. Shall we talk those buckets now. Conservation Conservation Commission will come the same day as water bodies. And we're going to ask on culture. And there's one other committee that's a lot of money. 2025,000. We weren't going to ask culture if they're level funded. Oh, right. If everybody, we've always said if they're not going to raise it, we don't want to see you. Right. But there was two groups, because their committee was fairly big, like culture, arts and culture, and one other. It was disability. Right. Disability. Right. There was, historically, as of years ago, arts and culture came up at town meeting because I had asked the question before I was on this committee. And you had the answer. They had asked for more, and you had agreed and said, but next year we have to see something, something. And so it kept coming up. And I think the past couple of years we've said once it's more than 10 or 15, once it reaches a certain level, we would want them to come and answer questions. Yes. But I think, I thought this year that we had determined that arts and culture, if they're level funded, we're okay. We're just going to hear the same feeling. They always bring 20 slides. So. No questions. You know, and they're not asking for an increase in their funding. And I think our experience is they're never going to decrease it. Right. Although our experience, I will say, with disability is we didn't keep having them coming in and we did decrease it last year. So it is possible to decrease it if we ask questions. I get it. I'm just saying that I'm comfortable not asking arts and culture questions. All right. So arts and culture, the commission on arts and culture is asking for the same amount they got last year, which was pretty much the same amount that they spent in the year before. And then the ballpark of $35,000. Right. So $35,000 last year, the actuals of $23,000, $35,000. So who feels that we should have them in to discuss their budget?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charlie. So, thank you. My question is, who is concerned about how the arts and culture people are spending taxpayer money? For me personally, I was last year and the year before. Last year, they came in with a very good presentation. And I felt that I was comfortable with how they were spending money. But that's me. And I'm opening up to people here. What I'm saying on an ongoing basis, how do we be giving any organization $35,000 a year or $50,000 a year is dispersing the taxpayer money to a group of private people. And, you know, how do we know that it's being spent well? We don't know. How do we know that? I mean, we've just done it because they were the two large ones. We can't spend our time on $3,000 and $2,000 budgets all the time. But I think we should at least, we could ask for a budget. Ask for a budget for arts and culture and ask for a commission on disability. Those are the two bigger ones. And to be honest, asking for the budget, I think, can be very good for them. Second. Second the motion. So, Anne, will you ask them for a budget? And Sophie, will you ask Cecilia? All right. And who else did we hear from? Let's see. Oh, sorry. One quick question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I haven't gotten an answer. Okay. Okay. Are you asking? Am I asking you or somebody else? I will add that. Oh, yes. Let me add that to the list. Okay. Okay. So, well, I guess. Right. Cause they're not under this list. They're on the Warren articles. That's right. Okay. Okay. And the other ones we've heard from scenic by the way, they're going to come in when the. Community preservation that comes in. And then tourism and economic development. They don't need an increase in either to zero waste. All right. So let's talk about tourism and economic development. They're asking for 42 75. Okay. I would like to hear that. Tourism economic development and scenic byway and two 50th anniversary. Groups are working together. Well, That's possible. Tourism to 50. And who else? I don't know. I don't know if it's related. It should be. So would you like them to come in? Yeah. Who was. Tourism is Angela. Yeah. And then scenic byway is. Clarissa. 250th. Okay. Do you want me to ask? To see if Angela can come in. On the day that the 13th. Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. This is a matter of policy. It might be. I mean, I thought I was suggesting. Great. They don't have to appear. But presenting a budget. I mean, that. I hate to do it for $3,000 for the. Last one, but if we do it for one, maybe it's nice to have. It's a big policy. Yeah. Maybe not. Who else? Just the four. So yeah, just those four. Can you get in touch with everyone again and say, you want some form of budget? Yep. And again, You have until. So I told him this Thursday. Okay. Give them. It's been another. Let's have it before we meet again. So give it, give it. Give them until the. 22nd. 22nd. Okay. So they have this week and then they have next week, but next week is the vacation week. Okay. So I'll pass. Yeah. So, so each one of these. Make it to the 26th 26th. Give us a budget by the 26th. And tell us. Because we're going to take a vote on the 26th. Okay. And what do I. We're going to take a vote on the 26th. The 26th with no funding them if they don't give us a budget. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm wondering, is part of the budget, maybe just like a quick paragraph or a narrative for what they've been up to or how they plan on spending it. I'm sure that kind of goes with the budget, but for some of the ones you may not necessarily hear, maybe just a quick. Narrative that just explains what they're up to. Yeah. We're going to get into the. What's an adequate budget and what's not. How are they spending their money? That's that's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think it's a good idea to ask them all for budgets, but I do. These are all committees we're asking. They then have to draw something up and then they have to meet with their committees. And then they have to come up with a budget. A light hand would be good. How are they? Okay. Briefly. Yeah. Okay. Other than a two. And we approve the other celebration and events. Veterans day, Memorial day. That's kind of. Okay. Page one. These are all. And I haven't heard otherwise. Level of funding. Okay. So the budget is five, six, six, seven. Your emotion. Second. Second. All in favor. Any opposed. On page one 95. Okay. Let me put a parade. Memorial day. If you'd say. Specifically. Flags on grades. We got to do this by state law. I'm spending 4,500 each year. Okay. Second. All in favor. Say I. Post. All right. Town day. So moved. Second. All right. Any discussion. On paper, say yes. Okay. Until they come in on 13. They're coming in on the 13th. Well, oh, right. Okay. Tourism and scenic. Byway. I'm not sure. I don't. I will, I will look around for that. Okay. I thought Alice. Are you working on the tour? Okay. I thought you were sorry. No. Okay. I try to spend much more than that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. All right. So. We will meet next. On the 28th. And then the 28th. And it sounds like we might have some budgets. And then hopefully we'll have more committees and commissions to the truth. All of them. And. DPW. There are always lots of questions with DPW. Yep. Okay. So Jennifer and Jordan. And facilities is next Tuesday. So get any questions for. So these animals. Okay. A bit of a random question. I know, but I. I learned it. An hour before the meeting that. There was a. There was a sale. Arts and artwork. Robin's library. There's a sale happening next week, I believe. And there was a sale that happened. A year ago. And then the one article. Or in the news article I read, it said that. There was the money goes to the job. Yeah. But that there was going to be talking discussion about allocating it back to the libraries. So I'm just curious. I mean, I know there's a lot of money that was wanted at some point. Nobody is there. Some connection between. There's been a changeover in town government, you know, since then. Do we track any of that as finance committee? When money. No. I don't know. I don't know. How much money are you going to sell something? How much money are you going to make it? And I forget the numbers. He gave me, I could look it up. It's very little. Mostly they're trying to get rid of them. It's not primarily. I could find out because I know we asked how much money are we going to make, but just technically they have to sell them. Right. I mean, I know the. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Did you know that you guys were selling. He's nice. And stuff. So, I don't know. And they were not precious. And. The other thing you got to keep in mind is it's one time money. You can't put it into personnel anyway. So. So for then Carolyn. I was going to say. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. When that were. There's a library trustee there. Oh, Oh, Precinct. Explain this because people are like, Oh my God, they're showing up all the hours. And it was like, no, it was a fire hazard. Storage. Okay. I'm assuming these are the ones that you can borrow. It's like borrowing a book. Oh, it's not even those. And it's not very valuable. Okay. Therefore, and it was taking up space. Yeah. But lots of space. Right. So they need to. Okay. They need the space. Okay. Anyone have anything else? Is there a motion to adjourn? So moved. Okay. All right. Okay. We'll call it. Great. Great job. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. </blockquote>
