> The Town Meeting on October 25th, 2023, was the fourth and potentially final night of the October special town meeting. The meeting began with a recognition of two individuals, Christine Bongiorno and Julie Brazil, for their efforts in ensuring the smooth running of the town meeting. The National Anthem was then sung by Ms. Tanaka. Eric Helmuth, chair of the select board, made a motion to adjourn the meeting to Monday, October 30th, 2023, at 8 p.m. if all business was not disposed of at this session. The motion passed. The meeting then proceeded with a test vote and a discussion on the issue of housing. Senator Cindy Friedman was introduced and spoke about the regional issue of housing. An amendment to add a parcel at 5 to 7 Winter Street to the parcel list for the Neighborhood Multifamily Subdistrict was voted down. The main motion, as amended by the Anderson Amendment, was then passed. The meeting concluded with a motion to dissolve the Special Town Meeting, which was passed.

> John Worden's point of order was that there should be no limit on the decrease in allowed new housing units that can be proposed in amendments to Article 12. He argued that if a vote against the main motion, which would result in zero additional housing units, is within scope, then amendments proposing a decrease in new housing units cannot be out of scope. The moderator agreed with Mr. Worden's reasoning.

> Senator Cindy Friedman addressed the meeting to discuss how the article fits into a larger regional issue. She acknowledged the MBTA Communities Working Group and the ARB for their work on complex issues. She commended the town meeting members for their civil and honest debate. She discussed the need for both a local and regional perspective on housing, stating that the issue is not isolated to their town or region. She highlighted the economic pressure from businesses and the state administration's concern about housing. She mentioned the loss of residents during COVID, particularly young working families and recent graduates, due to unaffordable housing. She also pointed out the acute labor shortage across industries due to the lack of affordable housing. She urged the need for more housing, affordable housing, sustainable and green development, and a working transportation system. She encouraged everyone to be part of the solution to solve the housing problem. She concluded by urging support for the amendment.

> Elizabeth Pyle, a zoning and land use attorney and former member of the town's residential zoning study group, expressed strong opposition to the Bagnall-Fleming Amendment, which proposes to increase the number of stories allowed in neighborhood districts from three to four. She argued that four-story buildings would negatively impact existing residents due to excessive height, massing, shadows, and loss of privacy. Pyle also voiced support for the Evans Amendment, which proposes to modify the map for neighborhood districts while still keeping the town in compliance with state law at 2,888 units. She urged town meeting members to vote against the Bagnall-Fleming Amendment and in favor of the Evans Amendment.

> Jeffrey Bremer, a resident of Arlington, expressed concerns about the impact of the proposed zoning changes on his neighborhood, Newman Way. He emphasized the importance of good communication between citizens, their representatives, and town members, especially when dealing with zoning issues. He highlighted the diversity of his neighborhood and expressed concern about rising rents and the potential displacement of long-term tenants. He did not explicitly support or oppose any specific amendments, but he did express a general concern about the potential for four-story buildings in his neighborhood. He also suggested that the town should do more to support those who are at risk of being displaced due to rising housing costs.

> Paul Schlichtman did not make any comments or indicate support or opposition to any amendments in the provided text.
</details><details><summary>Please, detail Elizabeth Carr-Jones' comments and indicate which amendments they support or oppose.</summary>

> Elizabeth Carr-Jones, a resident of Precinct 14 and a zoning and land use attorney, voiced her strong opposition to the Bagnall-Fleming Amendment, which proposes to increase the number of stories allowed in the neighborhood districts from three to four. She urged others to vote against this amendment, citing concerns about the impact of four-story buildings on side streets, including loss of sunlight, decreased privacy, and a scale that is out of sync with existing homes. 

Carr-Jones also expressed support for the Evans Amendment, which proposes slight modifications to the map for the neighborhood districts. She believes this amendment addresses problems with the main article while still keeping the town in compliance with state law. She also mentioned that the Evans Amendment takes into account the varying topography of Arlington, which she believes the working group did not consider when drawing up the original map. 

If the Bagnall-Fleming Amendment passes, Carr-Jones stated she would vote against the main motion. If the Bagnall-Fleming Amendment fails and the Evans Amendment passes, she plans to vote for the main motion. She also encouraged consideration of other amendments that reduce the impact of Article 12.

> Mark Rosenthal, from Precinct 14, shared a passage from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy to illustrate his point about the lack of transparency and communication in the government's decision-making process. He expressed his concern about the lack of public awareness and involvement in decisions that directly affect their homes and lives. He criticized the process by which the proposals were developed, stating that it does not serve the people or the town well. He did not explicitly support or oppose any specific amendments in his comments.
</details><details><summary>Please, detail David Pretzer's comments and indicate which amendments they support or oppose.</summary>

> David Pretzer, a resident of Precinct 17, spoke in favor of Article 12, stating that it is a meaningful step forward for Arlington and its residents. He argued that if more housing isn't built, seniors who need accessible dwellings won't be able to stay in Arlington, more houses will be turned into expensive mansions instead of multifamily buildings, and more renters will be displaced by rising rents. Pretzer thanked the working group for their efforts and for including the perspectives of renters and other underrepresented groups in their proposal. He urged listeners to vote yes on the main motion and also to support the Fleming-Bagnall Amendment, which would allow for larger buildings and thus more opportunities for affordable housing. Pretzer strongly opposed the Evans Amendment, which he said would dramatically reduce the amount of space included in the district and limit the potential of the proposal to help Arlington's residents.

> Rod Holland, Chair of the Redevelopment Board, provided comments on several amendments. For the Evans amendment, she stated that the Redevelopment Board was not in favor of it, as it would disrupt the balance of the overlay district across the town and feeder neighborhoods to public schools. For the Babiarz amendment, she stated that it was not in compliance with the MBTA community's requirements and could risk the entire plan being thrown out by the attorney general. For the Warden Article II, she stated that it would make the neighborhood areas completely undevelopable. For the Anderson amendment, she stated that the Redevelopment Board supports the option for businesses on the second floor but was concerned about providing a specific percentage.

For the Wagner No. 2 amendment, she stated that the Redevelopment Board is not in agreement with it as the three bonuses are strongly desired by the community. For the Leone proposal, she did not provide a specific comment.
</details><details><summary>Please, detail Robin Bergman's comments and indicate which amendments they support or oppose.</summary>

> Robin Bergman, a resident of Precinct 12, expressed criticism towards the restrictive zoning policies that have been in place for over 50 years. She argued that the town should allow flexibility for future generations and reevaluate the impacts of these changes on affordability, town services, taxes, and overall quality of life. Bergman supported amendments to Article 12 by Anderson, Babiarz, Evans, Lane, Loretti, Wagner, and Worden, which she believes would prioritize affordable housing and prevent the construction of more market-rate luxury housing. She opposed the Bagnall-Fleming Amendment, arguing that it would negatively impact adjacent houses by blocking solar panels and gardens, and creating heat islands.
