<summary>Annual Town Meeting Night 5</summary>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Wednesday, May 8th, 2024, and I'm calling to order night five of Arlington's 2024 annual town meeting, and shortly we'll be transitioning into the special town meeting. There are three spaces that are reserved for town meeting members and town officials, employees, and vendors, and those are the auditorium floor, the center balcony, and the satellite room in the town hall annex. If you are a member of the public, you cannot be in those spaces during the meeting. If you currently are, please relocate to one of the galleries, which are the wings of the balcony. There's obviously been a lot of attention on article five of the special town meeting, the resolution which involves a very serious and challenging subject. We welcome the many guests tonight in the gallery. If we get to article five, there is going to be a lot of potential for heightened emotions. Nevertheless, I expect appropriate behavior in this chamber. For town meeting members, I already went through that on Monday. For members of the public observing from the gallery, let me describe three kinds of inappropriate behavior at town meeting. First, there's momentary loss of control, like cheering or applause. Please try to refrain from that. Then there's premeditated stuff that serves as a distraction to the meeting, like holding signs, banners, or waving flags. Definitely don't do that. And finally, there's interrupting speakers, the presenters down here at the podiums in front, like shouting or chanting while they're talking, and there's zero tolerance for that. I don't want to be in the position of asking anyone to leave tonight, but my number one job is keeping this meeting under control so that we can do the business that the people of Arlington have asked us to do. That's a lot of things not to do. Let me close with just what we must do. This process is now in the hands of town meeting, and we must allow town meeting to do its work. You may hear things from presenters tonight that you deeply disagree with. They may even cause you pain. You may find those things wrongheaded or even harmful, and you might be right. While we're in this chamber, I ask that you summon the strength within yourself to endure your disagreements with grace. Every time you succeed in doing that, you strengthen this institution, and you reinforce the principles of the republic on which it's built. With that in mind, please rise for the National Anthem.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephanie Kuntz - 420</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello. Dear Arlington town meeting members, thank you for being here and doing the work of Arlington. I am Stephanie Kuntz. I have lived in Arlington with my family since 2004. In the spring of 2015, my son Ben was in fourth grade, and as part of the curriculum at Pierce Elementary, he learned about Teosinte, a village in El Salvador. Later that fall, our family of four went to live in Teosinte for two months, which was an incredibly special experience for all of us. Arlington and Teosinte have been sister cities since 1988. We are part of a larger organization in which various cities and towns from the United States have partnered with communities from El Salvador since the Civil War there. The U.S. El Salvador Sister Cities Organization is based on a solidarity model between communities with the acknowledgement that each have much to give and much to receive. In 2005, Arlington resident Beth Sulzberg and town meeting member Elizabeth Dre strengthened the connection between our two communities by traveling to Teosinte, and on their return, worked with a group of volunteers to develop what is the current Arlington Teosinte Sister City project. Primary and secondary school students in Arlington learn about Teosinte as part of the curriculum. We help organize educational events here, such as co-sponsoring the recent Arlington Read selection, Solito. We provide a market by selling crafts made by the Women's Sewing Cooperative from Teosinte. The money from these crafts goes back directly into the community by funding student scholarships for high school and university, and village infrastructure projects as determined by their own town council. We also have a direct relationship with the people of Teosinte, strengthened by visits there. Three of us, Elizabeth and myself being two of them, went last month to visit, and again experienced being in this amazing community. And it's a very interesting, amazing community that we would love to share more information about. We feel newly inspired and that we have a lot to learn from them. Of course, WhatsApp has completely changed communications. We encourage all of you to get more involved with the Arlington Teosinte Sister City project in any way you can. We have an active board as well as member volunteers in a variety of ways to learn more and do more. Tonight, we've been selling excellent handmade crafts from Teosinte as well as delicious coffee grown nearby to directly benefit their community. Please come by at the break and visit. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Leah Lyman Waldron - 452</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome. Members of town meeting, my name is Leah Lyman Waldron. I am a resident in Arlington and also pastor at Park Avenue Congregational Church in Arlington Heights. As you may know, in November and January, two members of our community were struck and injured in crashes while crossing at the intersection of Park Avenue and Wollaston and Paul Revere. One of them, Linda Cohn, was a parishioner of mine at Park Avenue Congregational Church. Almost six months later, Linda continues to recover. Her life and her family's lives have been changed forever by an avoidable tragedy. Safety along Park Avenue has long been a concern for Arlington residents. But these two incidents in particular pushed some of us who live nearby to create a petition asking for the select board to support changes at that intersection and elsewhere along Park Avenue. And for the town to focus its efforts on pedestrian, bike, and vehicle safety across town. I wanted to share my sincere thanks to over 1,000 people who shared and signed that petition, many of whom are here tonight. As well as to the select board for hearing and supporting our efforts to increase safety on our roads. I also wanted to thank Chief Julie Flaherty and the Arlington Police Department and the Department of Public Works for their immediate response to these incidents, including increased monitoring of Park Avenue, signage installation, and enforcement of speed limits. And I want to thank Town Manager Jim Feeney and Transportation Planner John Alessi from the Planning Department for their ongoing efforts to make real, lasting change in pedestrian and road safety. You may have noticed short-term improvements, such as new crosswalk signage on Park Avenue at the intersection with Wollaston and Paul Revere, as well as an in-street pedestrian bollard at Park Avenue and Oakland. Looking forward with the fiscal year 2025 budget that you recently approved, the town will start design work that will lead to near-term permanent improvements and a clear roadmap for the future of this heavily traveled road. In parallel with work on Park Avenue, the town will be developing a traffic calming guide that enables short-term solutions townwide. Because these things take time to do well and some of the ongoing work is behind the scenes, I wanted to share this update and my gratitude for how thoroughly the town has responded as many people work to make increased pedestrian safety a reality here in Arlington. I hope that the model followed here will be extended to other problem areas in town and that you all will continue to communicate with the town about road safety needs and to support their efforts in this direction. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. I would like to invite everyone to a free concert right here in Arlington's beautiful and acoustically perfect town hall on Sunday afternoon, June 9, 3 p.m. It's a tribute to Alan Hovhannes, who was Arlington's greatest composer, grew up here on Blossom Street, graduated from Arlington High School in 1929. If you're not familiar with the work of Alan Hovhannes, look him up. He has a lot of stuff on YouTube and Spotify and whatever. He's a brilliant composer. I've left flyers in the lobby for the concert that you can pick up. Did I mention that it's free? It's co-sponsored by the Armenian Cultural Foundation and the MIROC Foundation. I hope to see you all here. It's really going to be an excellent concert featuring some great local musicians.</blockquote>

If you're in Precinct 1, can you please check your handsets to make sure that it has your name on it? Thank you. We found it. All right. All right. I'll allow that applause. Okay.

That takes us to a test vote. Okay. And the test question is, was Massachusetts – okay, the voting is turned on. Voting is open. The test question is, was Massachusetts the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, meeting the two-thirds threshold of the original 13 states required for it to take effect, for those states that ratified? If all of that is true, vote 1 for yes. If you think any of that is false, press 2 for no or 3 to abstain. Okay. Let's close voting. And the motion fails, and that is correct. Massachusetts was the ninth state, not the sixth. The ninth was New Hampshire. What's that? What is that? What's that? Oh, we need to go through the votes. No? Well, we should to double-check, right? While we're looking at that, what is the claim? Oh, New Hampshire was the 9th. Did I say 6th? OK, there we go. Thank you. That's why I have a test vote, to kind of shake things out of our system, right?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 235</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, Article 2 of the special town meeting is now before us. Do we have a point of order? Can you come to a microphone, so otherwise folks in the satellite room won't hear you, or on the video? Thank you. Matt Miller, Precinct 11. The question was, just for clarification, after voting closes, additional votes count, but they've already been voted. They just haven't been counted yet. Is that correct? I'm not sure I understand the question. Well, you said voting closed, and then numbers kept increasing. Do you have an explanation? Do we know why the numbers were still increasing after the green light went off? Yeah. Given the large volume of people voting, it takes a few minutes, a few seconds, to actually approach that information to the database. I see. So there's some latency between the clicking of the buttons and the registering of the votes in the database. Totally fine. Just clarifying. Thank you. That brings us to Article 2 of the special town meeting. Mr. DeCoursey, do you want to lead us off? Actually, before we start that, could we just show the speaker queue, and then we'll clear it, and then folks who want to request to speak can do so. There it is. We have an empty speaker queue. So if you're interested in speaking on this article, you can start clicking it. Mr. DeCoursey, go ahead.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 292</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. It's Stephen DeCoursey, chair of the Select Board. The Select Board moved unanimously for favorable action to amend the Poet Laureate Screening Committee membership. The Screening Committee came to us, and they requested a change. There are five members to the Screening Committee. They requested that rather than simply a town meeting appointment by the moderator, that the most recent Poet Laureate be a member. And if that person or prior Poet Laureate could not be a member, the moderator would appoint a town meeting member. I do have to apologize to the body. We do have a minor amendment, and it has to do with the sentence in terms of the confirmation process. The way it works presently is that the Screening Committee recommends a candidate. That candidate is confirmed by the Select Board. That's what we voted. We voted a change to allow the former Poet Laureate to join the committee. The way it's written in the report is that all members are confirmed by the Select Board. And we don't have any interest in the town meeting, I'm sure, have any interest in us designating each member of the Screening Committee. So we've offered a minor amendment, if we can put that up. And basically what it does is it strikes the word all members from the bottom, middle of section two. And we're going to ask that you insert the Screening Committee's recommendation for Poet Laureate shall be confirmed by the Select Board so that the process is just the same as it is now. That's the highlighted language is the change that's going to be proposed through the motion to amend. Our vice chair, Mrs. Mahan, will be making the motion to amend.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Diane Mahon - 13</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Mahan? Thank you, Mr. Moderator. I move that the amendment be received.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 133</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. We have the Mahan amendment is now before us. Thank you. OK. And just for folks trying to understand the process here and why this is allowed, this is exercising option three from the town meeting guidelines for submitting motions. If it's short enough within roughly 20 words and it's simple enough that we would allow it from the floor, which is what we've done here because of the short notice since the Select Board report for the special town meeting only became available yesterday. So we have it up here. Striking all members and inserting the Screening Committee's recommendation for Poet Laureate shall be confirmed by the Select Board. And now we have a speaker queue. So we'll go to Mr. Gersh first and then Mr. Jaspin. Thank you, Mr. Moderator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Gersh, Precinct 18. I move that we lay Articles 2 through 4 upon the table. We have a motion to lay Articles 2 through 4 on the table. And I heard a second. So this is a 2 thirds vote. All those in favor of which would bring us to Article 5, in case people haven't been able to do the math. All those in favor of laying Articles 2 through 4 on the table, say yes. All those opposed say no. It is not a 2 thirds vote. So we'll continue with Article 2. Thank you. I'll take Mr. Jaspin and then Ms. Thornton. Ms. Thornton. Oh, OK. Mr. Lewitton. OK. Mr. Jameson.</blockquote>

Is this changing that for this committee, that process?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm having trouble hearing you, Mr. Jameson. I'm sorry. Could you speak a little closer to the mic? And also, I'll pause the timer for a second. I should have mentioned this earlier. For folks at the podium, if you can put your face about one fist distance from the microphone, I hear that that should help. OK. Even if you're really tall. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Gordon Jamieson - 54</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So my understanding is that for most committees, when people come up to be nominated or selected for those committees, they go in front of the select board and are approved or is it received. I forget how that works. Is this changing that general process for this committee? That's my question. Mr. DeCoursey.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 105</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. That's Stephen DeCoursey, chair of the select board. As to this committee, what we're proposing doesn't change the process that we followed since 2014. There are five appointing authorities in library board of trustees, the school committee, the commission on arts and culture. We're proposing a change to have either the most recent poet laureate or the town moderator. And the final one is a designee of the town manager. Those individuals on the screening committee have never been confirmed by the select board. It's only the poet laureate herself that comes before us once the screening committee makes a recommendation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the clarification. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Ms. Malofchuk. And could we clear the speakers who have spoken or have passed, please? Go ahead. Beth Malofchuk, precinct nine. I would like to know how many appoint. I question the appointing authority of the town manager and the town moderator. I see this as a diminishment in the appointing authority of the town moderator. And so I'd just like to know a tally, if possible. A tally of what? Like for this committee? No, for all committees. So how many appointments to committees does the town manager make? How many appointments to committees does the town moderator make? We've seen in past years a diminishment. We've seen in past years a diminishment of the town moderator's appointing authority, which I happen to take a front to. So you're asking about positions across all committees appointed by the town manager or the moderator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know that number off the top of my head, Madam Clerk. We don't have an exact number on that right now.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Beth Melofchik - 167</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I rose just to say that I would prefer the town moderator's appointing authority not be diminished as a habit, which it seems to have been the case, as I said. In past years, we saw under different town moderators that appointing authority diminished. So how do you decide? Where do you take it from? What was the question? Who decides who loses the appointing authority? Until we make this change, the town moderator gets to appoint somebody. We make this change, the town moderator doesn't appoint someone. Town meeting decides to change that appointing authority. Not the people on the committee. Right. It's the authority of the establishment of the committees and the charter and the membership and so on. And the charter and the membership and so on is the purview of town meeting. OK. So I'm just one person who doesn't want to see the town moderator's appointing authority, in general, diminished as it has been in previous years. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

A few seconds ago, Barbara Thornton's name appeared on the speaker's list. My understanding is that she resigned from town meeting. And I just checked the list of current town meeting members, and there's no Thornton, and there's only one Barbara. So I'm wondering, how did she get on the speaker's list? Madam Clerk, did you want to explain that?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Juli Brazile - 65</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Julie Brazil, town clerk. Yes, Barbara resigned, and the other members of Precinct 16 appointed Marvin Lewatin to fill the vacancy until the next town election. We just didn't get that information updated on the thing. So Marvin is voting. Barbara is a device. And we'll get the name updated when we can. So it's really Mr. Lewatin with really weird spelling. Oh. OK.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Jaspin, did Mr. Jaspin pass already? Pass. OK, and we're done. So we're going to go ahead now with a vote on the Mahan Amendment, which we saw on the screen earlier. That the screening committee's recommendation for poet laureates shall be confirmed by the select board. So if you're in favor of applying the Mahan Amendment to the main motion, press 1 for yes. If you're opposed to applying that amendment, press 2 for no, or 3 to abstain. You have 10 seconds to vote. OK. Let's close voting. And the motion passes 197 in the affirmative, 9 in the negative, 9 abstentions. So we now have before us the main motion as amended by the Mahan Amendment. So let's now take a vote now on that main motion, which, yeah. So voting is now open. So if you're in favor of the main motion as amended by the Mahan Amendment, press 1 for yes. If you're opposed, press 2 for no. Oh, OK. So let's hold on. Let's hold. OK, we're still showing a, oh, it's, it, OK. Are folks objecting to the, that it says amendment in the title? Because it's a bylaw amendment. The main motion is a bylaw amendment. OK, so I think we're good. OK, voting is now open. If you're in favor of the main motion as amended by the Mahan Amendment, press 1 for yes. If you're opposed, press 2 for no to leave the town bylaws intact, or 3 to abstain. OK, voting is closed. And the motion passes. 197 in the affirmative, 7 in the negative, 5 abstentions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Could you please display the slides? Yeah, switch over to the slides, please. OK. Good evening. My name is Rachel Zenberry, Chair of the Redevelopment Board. On behalf of the board, I will be taking you through Warren Article 3, an amendment of the zoning map, adopting the multifamily housing overlay districts, and amendment of the zoning bylaw. Next slide. After a year of public engagement, impassioned discussion, and ultimately mutual compromise during a special town meeting on October 25, 2023, town meeting overwhelmingly voted to amend the town zoning bylaw to adopt zoning consistent with Mass General Law Chapter 40A, Section 3A, also known as MBTA communities. The vote consisted of 84% of town meeting members in favor of this change. In doing so, the town adopted two new overlay districts, the neighborhood multifamily housing overlay district, and the Mass Ave and Broadway multifamily housing overlay district. The Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities has reviewed the text of the zoning bylaw amendment in Article 12, passed at the fall 2023 special town meeting, and has not identified any issues with the text as submitted. Next slide. As a reminder, the MBTA communities legislation was created to provide at least one zoning district where multifamily housing, which is defined as three or more dwellings, is allowed by right and meets additional district requirements. Tonight, we will not be reviewing and debating the characteristics of the districts themselves. The only issue that is addressed by this article is the specific procedural adoption of the zoning map and the amendment of the zoning bylaw to procedurally include the map of the overlay districts themselves. Next slide. The town has been made aware that the Office of the Attorney General has procedurally required the town meeting separately vote to adopt the multifamily housing overlay district zoning map. As a reminder, during 2023 fall special town meeting, the zoning map and associated parcel lists were presented with the multifamily housing overlay districts and were reviewed, debated, and discussed at length. Special town meeting even voted to reject specific amendments to the zoning map. The proposed map and parcel list we are procedurally voting on today are identical to those that were presented to town meeting on October 25, 2023 when town meeting voted to amend the zoning bylaw to adopt the new multifamily housing overlay districts. Next slide. The amendment for this warrant article includes, next slide, text that establishes the creation of the new overlay districts and adopts the map. Next slide. We have included for your reference a zoning map combining the base zoning map of the town and the new multifamily housing overlay districts. Next slide. And the last slide is the map of the multifamily housing overlay districts themselves. The parcel list is not included in this PowerPoint presentation but is included in the vote language in your packages. The ARB voted four to zero at our April 29th meeting to recommend favorable action on article three. I'd now like to hand over the podium to our town council, Mike Cunningham.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cunningham. Thank you, Mr. Moderator, Michael Cunningham, Town Council. I just wanted to highlight some of the things we're doing here tonight. Last fall, the special town meeting approved this multifamily district. I received a call from the Attorney General's office when they were considering the language of the text, the zoning bylaw that we passed, and they suggested, in fact, insisted, that we include an amendment of the zoning bylaw, the map specifically. I know that this body considered the maps, was shown the maps, but the language itself did not contain the specifics that the Attorney General's office is looking for. Consequently, they agreed to extend the amount of time that they're going to use to consider that. So they have until June 22nd while this body considers whether to amend the zoning map. This does not change, as Ms. Zembrey said, this does not change the district in any way. It's simply an affirmation through the zoning map of what this body did last fall. I note that on a parallel track, there was a procedural defect with the notice of the ARB's hearing last September, September 11th, 2023. That was noticed at a time we filed these materials with the Attorney General's office. There was a posting period earlier this spring where there were 21 days for anyone who felt they were aggrieved by that failure. It was specifically notice of the ARB's September 11th meeting was not placed in a conspicuous spot in Town Hall. I know it was noticed a lot of other places, but that is a requirement. There was a claim filed objecting to the fact that that was not complied with. The Attorney General's office is currently considering that matter. It remains open. There's been some discussion about whether, you know, they could waive certain procedures. They can waive the requirement that that was not posted if they determine that the individual who has made that claim was not prejudiced or deceived in any way. So that's what we're waiting for that. In the meantime, it was the most prudent course to consider this zoning bylaw amendment because if it passes tonight, we could potentially be done with the MBTA Communities Act. However, there's certainly a chance that the Attorney General's office determines that there is a grievance is valid. Based on the material that's been submitted, I think that is unlikely. However, I certainly want to make the body aware of what we're doing tonight, and this is potentially the last act taken. That's the background history. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Cunningham. Before I take speakers, I just want to point out Ms. Zenberry and Mr. Cunningham talked about kind of what the scope of this article is for debate. With all due respect, there's only one person who's the judge of scope, and that's the moderator. That's me, but I agree with them. Whoever drafted the Warren article text hemmed this in pretty tight, that one of the conditions that is consistent with the multifamily housing overlay districts zoning approved by the town's fall special town meeting on October 25th, 2023. So we are not going to have another four-hour debate relitigating what we already debated for four hours in October. I hope that's clear. So let's go to the speaker queue now. We'll take Mr. Newton, and then Ms. Evans.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening, Mr. Moderator, Sanjay Newton, Precinct 10. I rise this evening to say a couple of things. First of all, to say I'm sorry. It's unfortunate that we're taking up everyone's time tonight to re-vote the NBJ community's map. The map that we have in front of us, as you've just heard, is exactly the same map we voted at in the fall. There are no changes. However, it is important to have all the I's dotted and the T's crossed, and you've already heard the town council explain the situation. So we're here tonight at the request of the Attorney General to confirm our vote from the fall, which brings me to the last thing I want to say to you, which is thank you. As I have watched a few other communities struggle to come to agreement about their MBTA community's plan, I am heartened that thanks to your work and engagement, we were able to pass our plan overwhelmingly at town meeting last fall. The plan we passed together has received final approval from the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. We are one of only three communities who have achieved that milestone as of May 1st, alongside Lexington and Salem. There is more that I could say, but in the interest of time, I will leave it there. I look forward to completing this procedural vote and getting our final approval from the Attorney General's office. Good evening. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll take Ms. Evans next, and then Mr. Haltman. Thank you. Wenell Evans, Precinct 14. In the legal notice that was published by the Attorney General's office and the advocate in Star concerning the defect in the original public hearing notice, which had to do with when and where those notices of hearings were published, the notice states that written claims may be made that the notice defect was misleading or otherwise prejudicial. It goes on to say that, quote, if no claim is made, the Attorney General has the discretion to waive any such defect. If any claim is made, however, the Attorney General may not waive any such defect, end quote. So, since a claim has been made, the possibility, even if unlikely, does exist that the AG may not approve the bylaw as it was voted last fall. So, my question on the procedural nature of this vote is, number one, it seems that we are voting on an amendment to an article by voting on the map. Given that that article has not yet been approved, I'm wondering if we can do that, and if, by some chance, the AG chose not to approve this bylaw, will we then be revoting the entire article from the start? Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cunningham, do you want to address that? Thank you, Michael Cunningham, Town Council. Yes, we can vote on this zoning bylaw amendment at this time, and yes, there is a possibility. If the Attorney General determines that the claimant was prejudiced or misled in the process by the failure of the procedural defect, that it wasn't placed in Town Hall, then, yes, there is an opportunity. There is a chance that we'd have to redo the entire MBTA Communities Bylaw. Again, I think that's unlikely, and I'd stress it is pending. I spoke to the Attorney General's office today, and they reaffirmed that they can grant a waiver upon consideration of the claim itself and the materials that the Town has provided to them, demonstrating the amount of notices that were given to all citizens, including the claimant. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sarah Suarez - 440</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Good evening. Good evening. I'm Sarah Suarez, Assistant Director of Planning and Community Development for the Town of Arlington. I'm here tonight to discuss a parcel of land that's owned by the town. It's located behind the St. Athanasius Church along Acton Street and Appleton Place. This land is highlighted in red on the screen and sits just north of the Audison School. In 1963, the town extended Acton Street through the school property in order to connect it to Appleton Place. The road extension resulted in an orphaned strip of land on the opposite side of the road from the school. This land is adjacent to the church property and extends the entire length of Acton Street extension. In 1970, the church requested permission to pass over the town's strip of land to access the parking lot at the rear of its property along Acton Street. The town engineer investigated and made two recommendations to the select board at that time. Number one, that the entire strip of land be sold to the church via a town warrant at the 1971 town meeting. Or number two, that access be granted to the church to alter and use the strip of land as requested. While no article, warrant articles have been discovered related to this, it would appear the town chose to grant permission to the church for the church to cross over the town's land to access the parking lot. Next slide, please. There's been subsequent discussions about the town's land since then, and there is a renewed interest at this time because the church is in the process of selling its rear parcel along Acton Street and Appleton Place, which is bordered by the town's land. During discussions between the town manager, town council, and staff, it was determined that now would be the most opportune time to proceed with the disposition of land. On its own, the town land is just over 5,000 square feet and comprised of a triangular shape at the corner of Acton Street and a long, narrow strip of land running the length of Acton Street towards Appleton Place. Next slide, please. Due to its unusual shape and limited square footage, this is an unbuildable lot on its own. There are no utilities on the site, no conservation restrictions, and there is limited financial value to this property as it is. However, it would be considered more valuable considering the adjacent land is now for sale. Next slide, please. I'll now turn it over to town council to discuss the legal steps for moving forward with the disposition of land. Mr. Cunningham.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 239</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator, Michael Cunningham, town council. First I'd like to thank Deputy Town Council Jacqueline Munson and Peter Buckley from the legal department for all their work. This property has quite a bit of background to it. It was difficult to figure out what exactly was going on with it, but it's been discovered and I think it was known to some, but it's under the care, custody, and control of the school department. So this is just another step in the process. This would not result in the immediate sale of the property. The bylaw went before the select board for hearing. It's before you tonight. Your vote is required, a two-thirds vote, to move it ahead to the next step, which would be to send it to the school committee to see if they wanted to declare this property surplus and are therefore available for disposition. It would then go back and be subject to a public bidding process if it is declared so. The town would put that out to public bid. The town can consider bids, whether those are advantageous to the town. The town would be under no compulsion to sell it if those bids were not sufficient, but then the select board would make a determination at that time. So tonight's vote would not be to dispose this property immediately, however, it is a step in the process towards potential disposition.</blockquote>

I have two children who went through Arlington Heights Nursery School, which is right there. Having the forest there was really nice. Also, I just think the loss of additional trees in the town wouldn't necessarily be desirable, in my opinion. I know that this wouldn't immediately result in a sale, but if you were to imagine that whole parcel going to somebody else, I would imagine that they would want to kind of probably cut those trees down and build something, but that's, yeah, that's it.</blockquote>

Closer, okay. All right. So, yeah, I would reiterate what the first speaker said in that I do have, actually have one student, one child at the Audison School, and I drop her off on a regular basis, and it is a very congested area, and I just wonder if nothing happens to that space, I think that would be a good thing. If it was developed in any way, I just can't imagine that there's room for more activity there, so I would prefer that the town retains rights to it and really just continues to do nothing with that land.

Under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 44, Section 63, the sale of real property, real estate, will be reserved as a receipt reserved. So that means that it will be segregated from the general fund into a separate fund and earmarked for a specific purpose. So funds would then be proposed for use and then appropriated and approved by town meeting. So let me make sure that I understand what that means. That means that we would be selling an asset. We would reserve the value of that asset that could then be applied to the purchase of another asset or to offset debt or for some other purpose that would be appropriate for one-time money. That is correct. Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll take Ms. Popova next and then Mr. Stephen Moore.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. I'm Marina Popova. I'm Precinct 13. First, I wanted to tell you like two things that happened kind of in my mind today. First is I've got this. Maybe closer to the microphone. Sorry. Can you hear me now? Yeah? It's good? Okay. So the first thing is I've got that CSO alert. I don't know if any of you are getting that. It's the, you know, the overflow, the LOI overflow. So and I was thinking, man, you know, when are we going to finally fix that? And then I was thinking about the Mugar land. Remember the Mugar, you know, and, you know? So it is related. That's why. Because one of the reasons why people are fighting so much for the Mugar land and there's like so much support from actually pretty much a lot of people in town is because they want to preserve trees and they want to be able to absorb more water and, you know, fix the problems with flooding that are resulting in those CSO alerts that we just got today. So and the main question that is usually asked when, you know, in those hearings about the Mugar land was, you know, if everyone in town really wants to fix it, why is the town helping us more to, you know, to do something and stop the development in that, you know, Mugar land? And the answer usually is, well, the town cannot do.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 38</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Ms. Popova, you've said the word Mugar I think about seven times now. I haven't heard the word Acton. Yes. Can you pull it back into the scope of the article, please?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Marina Popova - 175</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. So the answer to that question is usually is because the town does not own that land. That's why we cannot do anything and we cannot fix that. So now we have this land at Acton, which town does own, which means that we don't need to do anything to actually preserve those trees and be able to absorb the water and kind of prevent the problems that we see right now happening around. And the other point is with this Acton land. I mean, if you reserve it as the open space that we have so little right now left in Arlington, could not, for example, our schools like Autism benefit from that? There are kids there. You know, they can certainly utilize some of the open space and do some natural programs. There are other schools nearby. So what I'm saying is that maybe we could think a bit more about how the Arlington community could benefit from this land before we try to sell it. That's my only point. Thank you.</blockquote>

I have no children at Autism or the nursery school there. However, I am a member of the Arlington Tree Committee. I'm not speaking for them tonight. However, I do want to echo what Ms. Popova had to say and the other speakers in that we should not be selling off land unnecessarily that represents some of the diminishing open space that exists in town. This one has trees on it. The trees is something that should be retained. I would like to ask through you, do we have an idea of the value of this land if it was to be sold, Mr. Moderator?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. No, no, no. Actually, this is actually important. Because I want to understand that there is an intelligent process by which we are disposing of this land. The reason being is if we get it wrong we get effectively nothing. So for instance, slight digression, if the person who buys the site, the church site, right, that parcel is worth quite a bit to them but it's worth nothing to anyone else effectively. And they'll be able to bid whatever is the minimum amount that is minimally acceptable to the town to clear that sale. However, my question is, is there a mechanism by which we could coordinate with the church on a collective disposition because those two parcels together and not just as a public bid but brokered by like a professional brokerage would generate by far the most proceeds for the town. Putting aside whether or not this is a good idea to sell this thing, if we want to maximize dollars for Arlington it would be a process that is coordinated with the disposition of the church parcel through a professional process.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the parcel in and of itself is basically land of low value because no one could do anything with it.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of this resolution began with Arlington residents calling their elected representatives, forming phone banks, meeting monthly with Catherine Clark's staffer at Robbins Library, participating in standouts and marches, and banding together across Congressional District 5 to speak with Representative Clark and Senators Warren. and marquee staffers, including in Washington, D.C., presenting them with a ceasefire petition signed by hundreds of Arlingtonians. We were told by our reps that there was nothing we could say that would affect or impact them. So we turned first to the Arlington Human Rights Commission, then the Select Board, and now to you, with the hope of adding our call for a ceasefire to the calls from countless cities and towns across the United States. When Arlington residents first approached the AHRC for a statement similar to those they have issued about many other global crises in the past, we were told it was not the best or most appropriate place. However, the AHRC and DEI Director Jill Harvey created a process, and hundreds of impacted residents participated in four listening sessions and wrote letters. The AHRC took all of this feedback and created a report that shared their findings, as well as suggestions for actions that came directly from the community. The AHRC has endorsed the ceasefire resolution to town meeting. They didn't need to. They had the ideas for action, they'd heard the division, and they'd heard the hurt. And so I hope everyone here pauses to consider that they did. We then went before the Select Board twice. They heard dozens of testimonies and received hundreds of letters from impacted residents who had never contacted them before. The Select Board then ruled no report, an uncommon decision, explaining that the Select Board is not the best or most appropriate place, but that town meeting was as the body for the people's voice. And now here we are. In town meeting, with so many community members who have been personally touched by this conflict, inspired to write to you, asking for some collective support for a ceasefire, for the return of hostages, and for an end to a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And once again, the question is asked, is this the best and most appropriate place? My question, on behalf of the hundreds of community members who have done everything they can, they have checked every box the system has required of them, is this. Where is that best and most appropriate place? If it doesn't exist, then perhaps we need to consider this moving forward. But for tonight, town meeting, a body who consistently votes on aspirational resolutions and has for hundreds of years, is the best and most appropriate and only place we have left. We are inviting you into solidarity to amplify our smaller voices and to recognize, as we have through the AHRC process, that complex global problems are also complex local problems. Many Arlington residents want to talk about this. Many town meeting members want to talk about this. I wish more of you had been able to attend one of the conversations that we held for town meeting members over the past three days. There were all kinds of opinions and beliefs and convictions brought, but we all centered on human dignity first, and we learned a lot that we didn't know about each other. I'm humbled by these conversations, and I'm hopeful. What brought us to this place of conversation and deep, slow, intentional community building that can hold our fears, our pain, and our differences was facilitated by the process of seeking an Arlington ceasefire proclamation. It has cracked the painful silence in Arlington, and I ask that you support and affirm this first step in our healing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. Name, please. Chadi Salamoun. I'm here tonight to implore you to pass Article V. Many of you have asked me why I think this article is appropriate in town meeting. I think the most honest answer I have is in the form of a question. What would you hope a small town in Gaza would do for you if your children were buried under the rubble of the Thompson School, if they were slowly starving to death in front of your own eyes, or if your own mother was dying from cancer and did not have access to medical treatment she needs to die with dignity and without pain? That's really the question before us tonight. What do we owe each other? What responsibility do citizens and local governments have in times of deep moral crisis, particularly when their national government plays a significant role in that crisis? Please understand that town meeting is not where I expected to find myself tonight, vulnerable, desperate, begging my local officials who I do not know to please help me. Help me advocate for children trapped by gut-wrenching violence. Help me to stop the bleeding, the cries of hunger, to please hear us because we are screaming so loud. I know some of you believe this article is divisive. I have to tell you I'm a little perplexed by this sentiment. This town was already divided. The only difference was that before this resolution, one group suffered an utter silence. Now Arlington is talking about it. While this article may make us feel uncomfortable, I'm quite certain ignoring the problem is not the right path forward. It's not going to help us heal as a community. It's not going to bring us together if we pretend we really have no responsibility to do what's uncomfortable but morally right. I understand that some of you believe that resolutions are meaningless. I can't disagree more. They are incredibly important. Last year, I introduced a warrant article asking the town meeting to urge the state house to change a state flag that's injurious to indigenous people. I asked you to imagine what it must feel like for an indigenous child to walk into an Arlington school with that flag flying overhead. This resolution is similar. It tells Palestinian and Arab children that they do not walk alone, that they have the validation from the Arlington community to the pain that burns on the inside, but no one can see or feel but them. I know some of you are worried how a yes vote may make some people feel. I ask you to consider what the silence of the last seven months has felt like to many residents. If tonight Arlington chooses to turn away from this article, I ask you to reflect what tomorrow will feel like for the Palestinian and Arab residents of Arlington who wake up to the realization that Arlington won't stand up to acknowledge our humanity during our darkest hour. We're shut out of the democratic process at the federal level. And I understand that there is a no action amendment tonight that seeks to do the same. From D.C. to town meeting, we will have no voice, no place where we can talk about our suffering. Tonight is our 12th meeting with town government on this matter. Many of us have worked on this every day for the past four months. Whatever you do tonight, however you decide to vote on the main motion, I ask you to vote no on the man substitute motion. It will make us invisible. Please allow us the dignity of a vote. If town meeting isn't the right place for this article, then I must ask, where should we go? Finally, I encourage you to reflect on the language used in resolutions in other cities and towns and appreciate how much care we've taken to create a document that really seeks to bring us together, to advocate for what we really value in Arlington. Arlington rights, human dignity. These are the values that can help us navigate our way forward together. But first, you have to do your part to communicate to our representatives that Arlington says no to violence and yes to a ceasefire. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Fleeg. Okay. Proceed. Thank you. I propose this amendment to add a whereas clause to the main motion, whereas we as members of the Arlington community must also acknowledge the actions of Hamas and the State of Israel to do not reflect the views of Arab, Muslim, or Jewish people in Arlington. I am a member of the Arlington Human Rights Commission, and I speak here in my capacity as a town meeting member. At the Human Rights Commission, we held four meetings between March 20th and April 24th that discussed the events in Israel and Gaza. We also held four listening sessions to be able to hear everybody opine about these events. Many of the comments we heard and read revealed the depths of pain and suffering that the residents have experienced, some very personal. Some comments, though, leaned dangerously towards dehumanization and marginalization of individuals and tied actions by certain entities like Hamas and the State of Israel to the collective identities of Muslim and Jewish people. Each of us here has been an outsider at some point in their lives in some sphere of their individual lives. I know what it means to be an outsider. My grandfather's family was one of the largest mass migrations in human history, and I speak from personal experience as a child of refugees and now as an immigrant to this country. I know what it means to feel like an outsider and to be associated with the stereotype. Being seen and heard as an individual is the most human and welcome emotions that enables a sense of belonging within a person. Just as we aspire for ourselves to be considered as individuals, this amendment recognizes the need for everyone within the community impacted by this conflict to be viewed as individuals and human beings. This amendment reflects what we heard from a diverse segment of Arlington community, many faiths, a multitude of ethnicities, many nationalities, and differing immigrant status. The addition of this clause makes it explicit that we believe that actions by some do not reflect collective identities. The intent for this amendment is aspirational, and it is put forth for the entire community. Please join me in voting yes for this amendment. Now I invite David to speak.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello. I hope everyone can hear me. My name is David Flagg. I am a resident of Arlington and a part of the team which drafted the resolution. In order to explain why I want you to support this amendment, I feel obligated to give a brief history of how we drafted the article. When we started to write, we looked at the resolutions that have been passed by the Massachusetts cities of Somerville, Cambridge, Medford, Melrose, Greenfield, North Hampton, East Hampton, and the town of Amherst. Unfortunately, in that process, we missed resolutions of some important groups. We didn't consider that cities outside of the U.S. would send ceasefire resolutions to our federal government. We didn't look at the ceasefire resolutions passed by the many Native nations within our country. I support this amendment, which addresses this omission. I don't have time to read all of them. The insights of Belfast, Ireland, the Red Nation, the Oceti Nation, the Diné, Mohawk, and other groups. However, there is one line in particular that I want to highlight. Finally, be it resolved that the Oceti-Sakowin Treaty Council advocates for the dignity and safety of residents in every community, regardless of what crimes its leadership may commit, and that peaceful diplomacy is the only way to achieve this safety and dignity. Gregory Stanton, the founder of Genocide Watch, defined the ten stages of genocide, several of which directly inform this amendment. Stage one, classification. Groups in a position of power will categorize people according to ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality, employing an us-versus-them mentality. Stage four, dehumanization. The diminished value of the discriminated group is communicated through propaganda. Parallels are drawn with animals, insects, or diseases. Please support this amendment, as falsely equating all members of a group with either their leadership or their most violent members is a key step in the process required to deny calls for a ceasefire and the work to support human rights for all people. This amendment supports the key distinction between Jews anywhere and the Israeli government, Palestinians and Hamas. It emphasizes what I hope, and what I hope will be affirmed tonight. A core value of our town, best said by Martin Luther King, Jr., that we be judged not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Nora Mann - 593</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main motion on Article 5 asks the town meeting to take a position on a war being prosecuted across the world. While the war is on the other side of the globe, like all diverse communities, it is one to which Arlington residents are deeply connected. They may have friends and family in Gaza and in Israel, and they may also be grappling with their personal feelings of conflict, fear, and trauma. I acknowledge and affirm that pain. In short, our town is deeply divided. I stand here in support of a substitute motion of no action because I believe that being forced to take an up or a down vote imposes a false binary and will exacerbate the existing pain and division in our town without having an appreciable effect on the lives of children and families in Israel and Palestine. And I offer this to give voice to those town meeting members who would otherwise feel that they must abstain entirely. I want to acknowledge that any position that town meeting takes on the main motion will deepen the pain of a large number of our neighbors and friends. These include people who have felt unseen and under threat and those who love them. As a result, I believe that the town's role in this context should be to help residents rise above their divisions and nurture an environment of kindness, understanding, and mutual respect. Along with the other proponents, I believe that a vote in favor of the substitute motion of no action respects the nuance of a complex foreign conflict and places a priority on the health of our town. So what is different about this motion and simply voting no on the main motion? As a purely personal matter, I agree with the merits of the resolution. However, on principle, I do not think that the Arlington town meeting is a place to debate weighty and complicated matters of world and foreign policy that have no impact on actions taken here in town. Those supporting the substitute motion of no action may have different views on the merits of the resolution, but I believe agree on that overarching point. A vote in town meeting on this resolution is not a substitute for meaningful conversation about the war and its implications on our families and friends. Any town-wide discussion must happen. in a space and with the facilitation necessary for any person to feel and be safe and to feel and be heard. And that is not Arlington Town Meeting. By taking a vote of no action we are saying that we don't want to be forced to vote up or down on the merits. We are not dismissing the validity of the calls set out and at the same time we are not offering on behalf of our whole town a stamp of approval. I offer this substitute because it is what my principles guide me to do. I offer it as an option for each of us to vote our own principles and make one request. That we each afford our colleagues the grace to believe that their vote is in good conscience and that their vote is not for or against a ceasefire, for or against death and trauma, and not for or against an issue that is at the same time dynamic, complicated, and tragic, and about which we as the Arlington Town Meeting can have no real impact. I move the substitute motion of no action on warrant article number five. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already have a second on the substitute motion. Yep, and we do. So the substitute motion is now before us as well. So the motions have all been laid out, we've had all the speakers, and I'm going to take as little time as I possibly can to explain things that I think are important here procedurally. First of all, if you look at the text of the main motion, the McKinnon main motion, the second-to-last paragraph, be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be sent to the offices of the President of the United States, Joseph Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Ed Markey, and Congresswoman Katherine Clark. Resolutions are not self-executing. They can't send themselves, obviously, so I just want to ask if any town officials, since this is a non-binding resolution, are there any town officials who would feel compelled to follow through on that action? And Madam Clerk, can you just tell us a little bit briefly about the time frame and the manner in which you might do this, so the meeting can understand what actions might be taken.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, and one last point I'll make before we proceed to voting. I'm also reminded that there's no live speaker queue on this resolution, as I've announced in advance, because that's our policy that we've had for some time now for resolutions in general. Mr. Warden informed me before the meeting that at least the last three of my predecessors have not allowed substitute motions of no action, so this is a novel concept to town meeting, and I made the decision without consultation with the Town Meeting Procedures Committee. This is my decision that I made. I did not have time to convene that committee, given open meeting law and the notification time frame from when we found out that there would be no recommended vote, and so just very briefly, I get many questions about, like, why this is a lot, why is the substitute motion of no action allowed, and why, rather than just a no vote, and also why not just have abstentions mean that someone thinks it's not appropriate to vote on this at town meeting, and there are technical reasons for that that I'm not going to get into the details of here, but in my view, in my judgment, the main product of a resolution is that town meeting is expressing its will about something. It's not about appropriating money. It's not about doing something that's concretely tangible. It's about an opinion or the will or the values of the meeting in the aggregate, and again, it's not amending bylaws or anything that requires execution by a town official or a town body or a town entity or so on, and so because of that, I see that as a category difference from other types of articles, and in this case, in my view, there was a clear distinction between the opinion of being in opposition to the resolution in the main motion versus feeling that it should not be voted up or down by town meeting directly, and so as far as abstention, just very briefly, abstentions mean that your vote doesn't count in the tally, so if we had 252 town meeting members and 200 of them abstained, for instance, hypothetically, then that means that only 52 are deciding, and you might say, well, 52 is less than quorum of 64, but quorum applies to those who are present, not those who are voting, and so you could have a scenario where a very small minority of town meeting members end up voting yay or nay, which does not, in my view, express truly or accurately the will of the meeting, and so that's how we got here. So we will now take the votes on the motions in the order of, first, we will take the Synasia amendment to see whether to apply that to the McKinnon main motion. After that, we will take a vote on the Mann substitute motion, and that vote will decide whether the main motion, amended or not, will be replaced by no action, and then finally, we will take a vote on the resulting main motion of the previous votes, and there's a number of different possibilities, and we'll address that vote by vote when we get there so that it's clear. So let's take up now, we have point of order, a microphone so everyone can hear you.</blockquote>

If the substitute motion is affirmed and replaces the main motion with no action. Okay, wait, which order, sorry, I'm confused. So we first vote on the, we have to vote the subsidiary motions first, and the main motion, which may be amended or substituted, last. So it'll be the Synasia amendment first, and then, which will either get, sort of either amend or not amend the McKinnon main motion into a new main motion, or, and then we move on to this the substitute motion of no action, which is the decision on whether to replace the main motion with no action. And if we were to replace the main motion with no action, then are we then taking a yes, no, abstain vote on no action? Then we still have to take a vote on no action, and it is inconsequential at that point. Okay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we have to take it anyway as a procedural formality. Okay, so let's now proceed to a vote on the Synasia amendment. So if you are in favor of the Synasia amendment, adding a clause, voting is now open. The Synasia amendment adds a clause to the resolution. If you're in favor of that, press 1 for yes. If you're opposed, and you want to leave the McKinnon main motion intact, unchanged, press 2 for no, and 3 to abstain. Again, an abstention does not count toward the the yay-nay total. It's basically voting present. Okay, let's close voting. And these are all majority votes. And the motion passes, 152 in the affirmative, 32 in the negative, 26 abstentions. So we now have the main motion as amended by the Synasia amendment. Okay. And that now takes us to the man substitute motion of no action. So a yes vote here would mean that you replace the main motion with no action. We'll take a follow-up vote after that if that happens, but the follow-up vote is inconsequential. If you want to keep the main motion as amended by the Synasia amendment, you'd vote 2 for no. Let me restate that. If you want to keep the main motion as amended by the Synasia amendment, vote 2 on the substitute motion. Okay, we're voting on the substitute motion. Press 1 if you want the main motion to be no action. Vote 2 if you want to keep the resolution as the main motion. And vote 3 to abstain, which will not count toward the vote tally. Let's close voting. This is a majority vote. And the motion passes, 122 in the affirmative, 88 in the negative, 5 abstentions. So we now have a main motion of no action. And I'll do it. Let's hold applause, please. Please. We'll just do a voice vote on this. Since this vote is inconsequential, the meeting has expressed its will by majority vote of no action. But we have to take a vote now as a procedural formality. And so all those in favor of no action, say yes. All those opposed. It is a no action vote. I so declare it. And that disposes of Article 5.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Sophie Chen - 1254</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, everyone. My name is Sophie Chen. I'm a junior at Arlington High School. I use she her pronouns, and I'm so happy to be speaking to you all today. I recognize some familiar faces from precinct meetings, so that's very reassuring to me. I'm here to talk to you about Warren Article Number 22, which would lower the municipal voting age to 16 years old, which means that all 16 and 17 year olds would then be granted the right to vote for school committee members and for you all, town meeting members. So basically what it would do is we would set up a separate voting list for 16 and 17 year olds so that they could vote specifically on town elections, but they would have to register for federal and state elections at 18 years old. Next slide, please. So there are three main reasons why lowering the voting age would be beneficial to our town. The first is to improve civic engagement, the second is to improve civic education, and the third is to empower young people. Next slide, please. So first we will be discussing improving civic engagement. So studies show that voting is a habit and that once someone votes in one election, they are more likely to vote in the next election, and so by lowering the voting age to 16 years old, we allow for this habit to be established earlier on, and this is especially crucial because 18 year olds are in a very difficult transition period of their life. A lot of them are going off to higher education or entering the workforce full-time, and so voting absentee for their first election may pose a barrier, especially because the voting registration is tied to a permanent address and young people are highly mobile. So lowering the voting age to 16 years old when teenagers are still living at home in town allows for easier access to the ballot box and thus would promote young voices at the ballot box. Next slide, please. Next, I'm going to discuss strengthening civic education. You can see your slides on the side, too. Oh, yes. Thank you. So Tufts has done several studies on voter education, especially relating to young people. One of their findings is that black and Latinx voters are the least likely to make it to the ballot box and also the least likely to be encouraged to vote in high school, and so it's really important to talk about voting and encourage students to vote in high school because we see that they are more educated later on and they look upon voting more favorably, and so if we want to promote diverse voices in Arlington, which I know is a huge priority that we want to make sure that everyone's voices are heard, then it's super important that we uplift minority voices. There are several other studies that have happened at Tufts Circle. I encourage you to look into them. They're super interesting about young voter demographics. Next slide, please. And finally, I want to talk about empowering young people who are ready to vote. So I'm going to talk a little bit about neuroscience here. Sixteen-year-olds have fully developed their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and so while the full brain is not developed until 25 years old, cold cognition, which happens in that dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and determines functions such as abstract thinking or understanding a ballot, all those things that you would need in order to be an effective voter, are fully developed by the time you get to 16 years old. We also see that 16 and 17 year olds are about equal as older adults in terms of political understanding, efficacy, because their cold cognition skills do not improve as people age, and so this is compelling scientific evidence to allow for 16 year olds to vote. And we also see that society has already reinforced a lot of these ideas by treating 16 and 17 year olds as adults in many cases. 16 and 17 year olds are allowed to vote. I mean, not allowed to vote. I would hope they would be allowed to vote. They're allowed to work, and sometimes they're tried as adults for legal cases and serious crimes, and they pay taxes. And so if we're allowed to drive, we're allowed to have a license, which in many cases is tied to voter registration. You're asked if you want to register to vote when you get a driver's license. Then I think that we should also extend the right to vote to 16 and 17 year olds. This next section is about more common myths. I hear a lot of arguments that 16 and 17 year olds simply won't take advantage of this opportunity, even if it is granted to them. Yet I personally am a member of the Model Congress Club at my school, and we see that there's a high percentage of participation in politically related clubs at our school. We see that also on a larger nationwide scale, Harvard Model Congress, which is the conference we attend every year, is growing each year in interest. There's always over like 1,500 participants in the conference each year, and we also see that in terms of real-world impact. Protests are largely youth-led. Protests for climate, and some of you may have been around for the Vietnam War, but protests for peace during the Vietnam War were also largely youth-led. And so we see that young people are already really interested and engaged in political spheres. Next slide, please. We also see that in Austria, whose voting age is 16 years old, that when 16-year-olds were given the right to vote, they took that opportunity. And so it might be difficult to see from afar, but 16-year-olds, their point estimate is only about 2% less than the voter turnout for older adults. And the confidence interval actually includes values that are greater than the overall voter turnout for adults. And so that provides convincing evidence that 16 and 17-year-olds would take advantage of that voting rate. Next slide, please. And our final common myth is that this would just be an extra vote for children's parents. You may recognize this argument from the women's suffrage movement, anti-suffrage movement. But we also see that in Scotland, who lowered their voting age for the independence referendum, that teenagers are equally likely to vote the same as they are different from their parents. And so we would hope to see similar results in the United States if we were to lower the voting age. Next slide, please. So finally, I do want to highlight some other efforts from around the country and around the world as a whole. If we were to lower our voting age, we would not be alone. Several towns in Massachusetts have already submitted home rule petitions, such as Somerville, Cambridge, the city of Boston, around the country and the world. We see Austria and Scotland, which I previously mentioned, but also Brazil, Cuba, Norway as being countries who have already lowered their voting age to 16 years old for even presidential elections. And so if we were to lower the voting age for the town, we would actually not even be doing something extremely revolutionary. Next slide, please. And so that is my last slide, but I would be happy to take any questions that people have. Is that allowed by the moderator?</blockquote>

I had a teaching career that spanned over four decades, teaching students of all ages. I can say with certainty that I always found students to have an acute sense of justice and fairness and an ability to have clarity about what resonates with them. Young minds that haven't yet been conditioned to follow established rules that are not always fair or inclusive, understand what serves people well and what doesn't, because they see every situation with fresh, untainted minds. It is beyond time in my mind to break down the barriers of ageism and include our youth in decision-making, especially decisions that directly affect their lives. Arlington schools have a good civics program, and I see no better way to support our students and schools than by giving 16-year-olds the vote and inviting them to become engaged in the civic life of our town. I hope you will join me in supporting this article.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Joanne Cullinane - 1052</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, Joanne Cullinane, Precinct 21. As a loving mother of a 16-year-old and a soon to be 19-year-old, I urge you to oppose a change to the voting age that would allow minors to vote in local elections. And I want to emphasize I am still a loving mom. Having just watched one child emerge from childhood and begin to claim the responsibilities of adulthood, I am now watching another enter this all-important period of late adolescence. For this reason, I feel I have a unique vantage point from which to tell or remind you, as the case may be, that two years do indeed make a difference. As adults, we tend to think of two years as minimal, but the changes that take place in kids' minds and lives during this developmentally critical time period are huge. And that is why people who've raised children often marvel at how radically their children morph from inherently peer-driven and somewhat self-centered beings into individuals with vastly greater empathy and awareness of others. The transformation is simply astounding to watch. I applaud Sophie for her passionate interest in local issues. The fact that she brought this article before us is a testament to just how robust civics education in Arlington is. Arlington Public School students all take a year of civics in eighth grade, and I remember being impressed by the thoughtfulness of the curriculum when my son took it. Shout-out to Mr. Backey at Audison Middle School. Unfortunately, students at the high school do not revisit civics, and I would argue that instead of having minors jump into the deep end, so to speak, we should petition the high school to incorporate civics into the curriculum more as students approach age 18. It should be incorporated across disciplines and subjects, subject matter, and the new discourse lab would be absolutely perfect for a mock town meeting. I oppose lowering the voting age to 16, and both of my kids do agree with me on this, for three reasons. One, the science shows 16-year-olds are still developing long-term planning, which resides in the prefrontal cortex and not done maturing until age 25. Two, while teens have access to lots of information on the internet, they have fewer life experiences than kids their age did even a few short decades ago, so they have little context within which to interpret the information coming at them. Three, allowing 16-year-olds to vote when their parents and 18-year-old siblings have voting rights gives families with children undue weight in local elections, and this introduces for me significant equity issues. As for science, the American Psychologist article by Lawrence Steinberg et al., that's often cited by proponents of this article, state that 16-year-olds score as well as most adults in the realm of cold cognition, or the ability to reason in settings where there's no pressure to act rashly, while they score significantly worse than adults on psychosocial indicators. The author's argument is that these conflicting results explain the rationale of advocating for minors' rights to make health decisions, while opposing the practice of trying minors as adults in criminal cases. It's important to note that health decisions are highly personal matters and involve thinking about one's own well-being, whereas voting often entails thinking about what is best for others with whom one might share little in common. At 16, most teens have not emerged yet from the egocentric worldview that marks all of our childhoods, and their worldview is not as broad as it will be a few years later. This is important because voters are asked to weigh in on matters regarding taxes and budgets, and they have to consider how their votes will impact others. As a social scientist, I would note that Steinberg et al. downplay the artificiality of their tests. As social beings, our decisions can never be divorced from social and cultural context. The authors mentioned the limitations of lab-based testing and passing, and I have a long quote here, but I'm just going to summarize. They say that they have tried to divorce cold cognition from psychosocial aspects in their testing, but in real life, these things are always intertwined. Decision-making, as we've seen tonight, is often emotional. This means cold cognition is never entirely cold, and it is much less cold among adolescents. Adolescents have a biological drive to fit in and put membership in peer groups above almost everything else. While this is a natural part of growing up and something we've all experienced, it does not make necessarily for independent voters who are able to resist undue influence from others. As for life experience, I just want to say 16-year-olds lack a lot of life experiences that I consider prerequisite for voting on matters that affect all residents in town. Most employers no longer employ, sadly, kids 15 and under. So my son who's 16 has been unable to find employment in town, has no significant experience with budgeting or money. And I'm going to have to skip ahead here. Equity, another reason lowering the voting age is problematic to me is that I don't find this equitable. Kids spend a lot of time in certain places and in certain activities, and parents spend a lot of time worrying about their kids. As such, there will be large areas of overlap when it comes to how they feel about schools, parks, sports fees, and other things of heightened importance at this stage of their lives. Parents and children over 18 already have a vote, so if you expand the vote to minors in these same households, the voices of families with children are amplified, and those in town who are most frequently overlooked already are even more outnumbered. There's nobody we can enfranchise whose inclusion would amplify the voices of single people or the elderly in the same manner. This smacks to me of tipping the scales. I urge you to vote no on this article for these reasons, but to look for ways to encourage the high school to keep kids engaged after their introduction to civics in middle school. If we do that, then it is more likely these students will register to vote in larger numbers when they round the corner and turn 18. Thank you.</blockquote>

Our census data only categorizes in age ranges, and so- It's a little closer to the microphone. Yeah. Like a few inches away. Yeah. Is this good? Okay. Our census data only reports in age ranges, but the 15- to 19-category has about 2,042 people in it. So if we assume that the distribution of ages is equal, then we have about 800 added voters that are 16- and 17-years-old. And if we also look at Arlington High School's enrollment data, there are about, I believe, 700 students who are enrolled in 11th and 12th grade, and so if we account for those who are attending minimum regional high school or private schools, then we would get around the same number of 800 new voters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Ms. Monner, Michael Cunningham, town council. I've looked at this issue, looked at chapters 51, the regulations 950CMR57. In my opinion, no. This creates a separate class of voters, the local voters. This would not entitle 16 and 17-year-olds to run for office or otherwise participate and be true registered voters as those statutes contemplate.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct. They would not be registered voters the same as those who are 18 and over, and therefore would not be eligible in the same way for elected office. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Let's see, who did I select next? Oh, Mr. Lewicki, who passed. Okay. Mr. Barr, and then Mr. Schlickman. There we go.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you hear me? Okay. Joseph Barr, Precinct 5. I rise in support of the article. I just wanted to make two points. One, I'm not an expert in child development, but I am an expert in traffic safety. And I would just say that if we consider 16-year-olds to be sufficiently developed to wield a 2,000-plus-pound vehicle that can kill people very easily, then I think we can also trust them with the franchise of voting. So that's why I'm voting in favor of this. The other reason is that you may recall during special town meeting in the fall, there was a young person from Arlington High who spoke in favor of the MBTA Communities Act. That was my child, John Barr. And I just want to remind people, as a proud father, the quality of students we have at the school, including Sophie Chen, and that those are the kinds of people we'd be allowing to participate in our civic democracy. And I think we should all support that. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. At least those students should be able to vote, right? Mr. Schlickman. Paul Schlickman, Precinct 9, and Chair of the School Committee. First of all, I want to acknowledge the fact that we do an excellent job on civic education within the Arlington Public Schools. For the past two years, I have participated in Civics Day at Otteson, and the thoughtful questions that were asked to a wide variety of people, our state rep, state senator, myself, the superintendent of schools, and a bunch of other people in other rooms that I didn't get to see. It's just extraordinary. They're very thoughtful questions. And while we do not have a class called civics, we have a lot of civic engagement within our high school. And we do see those students coming to us with issues that they want us to address. Now, as somebody who's run for office in this town a few times, I note that when we have a town election, and remember, this only applies to town elections, not federal or state elections. We have, on the low end, maybe 10% of the voters coming out if it's not a particularly hotly contested election. Normally, we're around 18%, 20%. Maybe if there's something really interesting happening, we're pulling in the 20s, and if it's really hot or there's an override on the ballot, we're getting up to 30. Okay? 16- and 17-year-olds are going to act just like we do. There's going to be a subset of them who are engaged civically, very aware of what's going on, just like the first speaker on this article, who want to get engaged in local government. 17 and 18, and most of them probably won't. And maybe if they do, it could be a good thing, because they're the ones who are going to have to live with the results of what we do long-term. And we want them well-trained and thoughtful voters, and if they have the right to vote in local elections, I will guarantee you at the high school level, we will have forums for students who are eligible to vote to meet the candidates and learn the issues. It's our responsibility to do that. I cannot see how a core of about 800 16- and 17-year-olds are going to so overpower the votes of their adult companions that they are a threat to our election. And in fact, if they have a more outstanding rate of participation in our local elections than the adults, maybe that's a message we should send to the adults and get them to the polls. Please vote yes. Thank you.</blockquote>

I did have a couple of questions. So, I'm wondering how would a minor establish residency or proof of residency in Arlington? Do they have utility bills or leases that they could use?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Cunningham, do you have an answer to that? How does a minor establish residency? All right. Settle down, everyone.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 28</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Cunningham, Town Council. I'm not sure explicitly, but it'd be probably the same way in which they establish their residence for purposes of getting a driver's license.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Mark Kaepplein - 21</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, so a student would need to actually get a driver's license in order to be able to register to vote.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 35</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just not sure the exact paperwork required to get a driver's license, but whatever that is would be probably similar to be what would be required to demonstrate residency for purposes of voting registration.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Mark Kaepplein - 65</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, in a related question, when they do get a driver's license the state offers them the option to register to vote or for 16 year olds and up they can pre-register to vote and the state maintains a list of these people. Would the town list be the same as that or would be a separate list or there's any interaction between the lists?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My reading of the proposed home rule petition would be a separate list maintained by the town, local voters. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Mark Kaepplein - 10</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would that list be a matter of public record?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 50</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Okay, so 16 year olds, currently 17 year olds are known as real persons and they are a matter of public record, but now 16 year olds would be on a voter list and their date of birth and address and any party affiliation would become a public record.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 20</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I'm sorry. Ms. Brazil says no party affiliation would be associated with the 16 and 17 year olds, correct?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Mark Kaepplein - 70</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so so then people running for office can use this public information to contact kids and and ask them to vote for them, I suppose. I don't know what public officials would do but or people running for office but this is it would be a public record subject to discovery. And would participation in elections, would that be recorded also so I know who the frequent voters are?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Brazil says probably.</blockquote>

Okay, thank you. I still have concerns about privacy and opening up 16 year olds to being, have their information available as public record. And I do question judgment, you know, it's this so many tick-tock challenges and I'm not impressed with the decision-making on those who take part. And even those who camp out on college campuses, you know, most of us don't do that sort of thing.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's that's out of scope, Mr. Keplein. All right, thank you for your time. Thank you. I'll take Mr. Jalkut and then Mr. Miller. Maybe voting would be a tick-tock challenge, that'd be cool.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Daniel Jalkut - 513</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Daniel Jalkut, Precinct 6. I normally wouldn't share my age but I'm 48 years old which means that I've been voting for 30 years, every year of those 30 years as far as I can recall. But I'm here sort of speaking on behalf of my 16 year old self because when I hear people denigrate 16 and 17 year olds as if they're so incapable mentally that they would not even be given the opportunity to express themselves in a civic sense, that 16 year old me is offended. And I think anybody in this town who feels similarly to how I did, any 16 or 17 year old in this town, would be similarly offended if they knew that people were making blanket dismissals of their ability to reason publicly debated issues. So I guess it's obvious I support this measure. When I was 16, not only did I want to vote, I wanted to run for public office. So I made a promise to my friends that as soon as I'm 18 years old I'm going to run for City Council. And as it happened, the schedule of City Council elections in my hometown of Santa Cruz, California, didn't allow me to run until I was 19. But when I was 19 I did run. So I'm a little unusual in that my precociousness was strong enough not only to want to vote but to participate as a representative. But I would ask anybody who harbors doubts about the intelligence or the cognitive ability or the interest of 16 and 17 year olds to participate, maybe you just haven't met the right 16 and 17 year olds. And the same way we all know people that even though we respect and accept their right to vote, we kind of wish they didn't because they're not doing it right, so to speak. You're going to run into some people in this world who, you know, use their privileges in ways that you kind of wish they didn't. But I agree with the assessments that on the whole 16 and 17 year olds are comparable to 18 and 19 year olds when it comes to, you know, the likelihood that they would be engaged, knowledgeable, and willing to participate. And I think if you can think of maybe the most impressive 16 year old you can recall engaging with, and then think of the least impressive 18 year old you can recall engaging with, would you, if you could, grant them the opportunity to switch rights. Votes swapping is not in scope. That's about it. I just want to also add there's this kind of like generally applicable mindset, as far as I'm concerned, that when you work as a society, as a government, to expand liberties, you're probably doing the right thing. Unless there's an overriding reason not to extend rights to particular people, let's just say there's more mistakes made going the other direction than this direction. So I encourage you to vote for this article. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I'll take Mr. Miller and then Mr. Wagner. Hi. Matt Miller, Precinct 11. So I'm going to be brief. You can take three minutes off of my time. Actually, all I got to say, a lot was said. And what I think is that I talked to some parents who had more than one kid, and they said one of my kids I'd trust to vote. You know, but they didn't say, yeah I think the kids should be able to vote. That was what they said. And so I'm basing it on that. I'm also basing it on the fact that, well, if you want to drink, you can't do it. If you want to drive at 16.0, you can't do it. If you want to join the military, buy cigarettes, why can't you? I think there's a reason, and I think that the argument for it is legitimate. But, you know, it's kind of like when somebody shouldn't really be voting in Senate, because they really shouldn't. Then, you know, there's no way to balance it. So you're going to have some people that aren't. The final point is, I did some research, scientists, and so I looked at all the publications. So if you're looking at, you know, what's on the internet, you got to see if it's peer-reviewed, right? If it's not peer-reviewed, I can make it up too. Peer-reviewed, there was two articles that I found. There were two. Austria was included, and there was a second one. But there was one that really hit, and that one was, if you're 16, and then two months later, there's a federal election, and you can't vote. You're like, well what the hell? You know, you're saying I can vote, but I can't. I don't think that's going to make anybody feel better. So I think it should be at a larger scale, if that's really what people should be able to do. And that's my point. I'm gonna, I can't vote for it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 305</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, we have a motion to terminate debate. Do we have a second? Second. All those in favor of terminating debate on Article 22, say yes. All those opposed, say no. It is terminated. Two, three. Okay, we have five. So let's take an electronic vote on termination of debate. If that fails, we'll take Mr. Gersh and Dr. Henkin. Okay, we have a vote now on, voting is open on termination of debate. If you want to terminate debate, press 1 for yes. If you want to continue debate, press 2 for no, or 3 to abstain. You have 10 seconds. Okay, let's close voting. And debate is terminated. 174 in the affirmative, and a loud 35 in the negative, and three abstentions. So you're now going to vote on the main motion of Article 22. And while we bring that up, I'll just summarize. It's a majority vote to authorize the Select Board to file Home Rule legislation to allow Arlington to lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for town elections. This is Home Rule legislation. It has to go to the state level to be approved. Okay, voting is now open on the main motion of Article 22. So if you're in favor of authorizing the Select Board to file that Home Rule legislation, press 1 for yes. If you're opposed, press 2 for no, or 3 to abstain. Okay, voting is closed. And the motion passes. 161 in the affirmative, 49 in negative, and four abstentions. Okay, we have a motion to adjourn, and we have a second. Yeah, do we have any notices of reconsideration before we adjourn? Seeing none, all those in favor of adjourning, say yes. All those opposed, say no. We are adjourned until Monday, May 13th at 8 p.m. See you then, everybody. </blockquote>
