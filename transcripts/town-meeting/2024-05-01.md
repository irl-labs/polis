<summary>Annual Town Meeting Night 3</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 770</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, let's find our seats. Welcome to night three of Arlington's 2024 Annual Town Meeting. Okay, let's settle down everyone, let's quiet down. I have some notes regarding scheduling to start. Tonight we will jump ahead to Article 45 with the meeting's permission, the Minuteman High School budget, because we have to schedule the superintendent's visit in advance. Then we will resume where we left off Monday with Article 16. Next Monday, May 6th, will be Town Budgets Night. We will start with Article 39, continue to Article 40 for the capital budget, and then resume wherever we leave off tonight. We schedule that night because we invite all the department heads to answer your questions on various budgets. Next Wednesday, May 8th, will be the opening of the Special Town Meeting with its five articles. The Select Board is not expected to have its report available for the Special Town Meeting until early next week, perhaps on Tuesday. That gives very little time for you all to review the report, and we're going to do two things to address the compressed time frame. First, the Select Board voted tonight on Article 5 from the Special Town Meeting Warrant to not provide a recommended vote. So priority will pass to the petitioner who's working with a town meeting member to make the main motion under that article, and that is already underway. The Select Board will still have the opportunity to change their decision on any of the articles in the Special Town Meeting Warrant until they issue the report officially, but we'll operate under the assumption that their decision tonight will stand, and we can course-correct if that changes. We can course-correct the town meeting. So if you have amendments, substitute motions, or materials to share for any articles in the Special Town Meeting Warrant, including Article 5, the resolution, contact me in advance. You can find my contact info on the official town meeting page. The second thing we'll do to address the compressed time frame between the issuing of the Select Board's report and the start of Special Town Meeting is that on next Wednesday, immediately following Article 1 of the Special Town Meeting to receive reports of committees, anyone who feels that there's insufficient time to prepare is free to make a motion to adjourn the Special Town Meeting until the following week, and at that point, we would resume the annual town meeting if that passes. So if such a motion is moved and seconded, it will be decided by town meeting whether to continue with the five articles of the Special Town Meeting on May 8th or take more time to prepare. So power to the people, even if that means a little less predictability. Just a reminder that I sent an announcement to the TMM email list on April 19th that we'll be following the same practice for resolutions as we did at last year's town meeting. That affects Article 5 of the Special Town Meeting warrant and Article 66 of the annual town meeting. There will be one proponent speaking for and one opponent speaking against, plus proponents of any substantial subsidiary motions that I've approved in advance. That means no live speaker queue. Priority will be given to the petitioner of the resolution in selecting the proponent who speaks in favor. And as we mentioned, if the select board's vote tonight stands, then a main motion could be made by a town meeting member working with the petitioner of that resolution. Anyone interested in submitting an amendment or substitute motion for Special Town Meeting Article 5 must get those to me for review as soon as possible. If I don't receive your motion before this weekend, it's highly unlikely that it will be approved in time for next Wednesday's Special Town Meeting, assuming it doesn't get delayed through adjournment. You can find my contact info again on the official town meeting page. Lastly, seats for the next speaker in the front row have been reserved with pink signage that says reserved for next speaker. That's the on-deck circle, but instead of a circle, it's four discontinuous chairs. And so, when I call the second speaker, please try to find your way, if you're on the floor of the auditorium, please find your way up to one of those chairs. There's two here and two over there, so that you're ready to hop up to a podium when it's your turn, and it'll save us some time. And with that, well, there's no order here, it's just remarks, but point of order?</blockquote>

I think this is a point of order, at least I hope it is. You have explained how the speaker who speaks the proponent of a resolution will be selected, but how will the speaker speaking against the resolution be selected?

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moderator's discretion. Thank you. It hasn't been formalized. It's something that will, I think, be reviewed at some point by the Town Meeting Procedures Committee, but has not been codified. We actually haven't had enough speakers in the past to warrant a whole process for it. We'll see if that changes this time. Thank you. And with that, please all rise for the National Anthem. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. I didn't come up with tonight's vote, so we'll see what we get. Will the Bruins win the Stanley Cup? I think that's hockey. Is that what that is? And it passes. The Bruins win the Stanley Cup. Yeah, can we show the votes? Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Alex Bagnall - 498</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Alex Bagnall, Co-Chair of the Hybrid Town Meeting Study Committee. We were established, per the vote of this body, in the spring of 2023 with a charge of reviewing other towns' hybrid town meeting practices and technologies, including evaluating the legal landscape, policies, procedural, social, and access issues, and including the impact on community interest and serving in this body. We have started our business of evaluating and recommending potential technology approaches and also budgetary impacts. As we get into implementation, we will support this implementation as required. Next slide, please. We first convened in November of 2023 and have been holding monthly meetings. To date, we have attended Lexington's Hybrid Town Meeting, where they are using our old frenemy, the portal. We will continue to follow up with questions, including meeting with Belmont, who are currently engaged in a hybrid town meeting process, and attending Burlington and Brookline Hybrid Town Meetings. We are also evaluating and keeping an eye on the pending legislation that is before the state legislature. Next slide, please. We've also designed several surveys to assess opinions, concerns, and potential usage of remote town meeting access. Those surveys have gone to four groups, current town meeting members, former town meeting members, and past users of the town meeting remote room. Those surveys have fairly similar questions, and hopefully most of you have received a link to those surveys, as it pertains to you. We also have a survey that's going to the community at large. That survey can be found on our webpage on the town's website. Regarding the survey for current town meeting members, the link is there, and I believe the town clerk will resend the link tomorrow if you've lost that email somewhere in your inbox. So far, about half of you have responded. I wouldn't say it's a context, but Precinct 16 has about 100% response, and a few other precincts have only a couple or so responses. And I won't name you and embarrass you all. Next slide, please. So if it's determined that hybrid is a form of town meeting that we'd like to proceed with, right now we don't have a determination of what that time frame might be. It's impacted by several criteria, the technology that we can select, budgetary and contractual issues that we may be under, and also changing potentially existing town bylaws. Finishing up, if you want to follow our work, you can go to our page on the town website. You're also welcome to attend our hybrid meetings. We meet most fourth Mondays of the month. Our website has agenda, minutes, and reports. And I also want to call out the work so far of our members besides Alex and myself as co-chairs, Kerry Fallon, Pete Gast, Guillermo Hamlin, Steve Storch, and we've been supported really well by Syed Qadir, who's a member of the town's IT department, the town clerk, Julie Brazil, and of course, the town moderator, Greg Christiana.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Al Tosti - 344</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. This year, as a member of the Finance Committee, I was assigned to the Minuteman budget. It's been a school I've had a long-term interest in. For new members, Arlington has been an original member of Minuteman since the district was created almost 50 years ago and currently represents about a third of the district. The issue of Minuteman has never been about the quality of the education but the cost. You may remember that last year I handed out a spreadsheet which showed Minuteman's cost versus all the rest of the vocational schools in this state. The superintendent will respond to any concerns in that issue. Over the last two years, we've had two promises made by superintendents to the Finance Committee. Superintendent came, promised that the playing fields would be covered under their revolving fund and after the first year, the members would not have to pay a penny. Then the superintendent left. The next year, the superintendent didn't know anything about that, but then promised that the play fields would be covered under their revolving fund. That's the story of Minuteman.  Any increase in state aid from the governor's proposed budget in January will be used to reduce local aid. Then that superintendent left. So fortunately, the interim superintendent, Mr. Kevin Mahoney, was aware of both and carried both to fruition, and today all the playing fields are paid for by the reserve revolving funds of the school, and all local aid will be used to, increased local aid will be used to reduce assessments. Finance committee thanks him very much, and for the school, and we recommend favorable action on this year's budget. First, very briefly, I just want to introduce Sarah Montague, who is the Arlington representative to the Minuteman School Committee, so if you have any complaints at all, you go to her. If you have any compliments, you go to the superintendent, at least that's the way I was explained. So I'd like to introduce Kevin Mahoney, the interim superintendent for Minuteman School. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Request permission for Superintendent Mahoney to speak to this body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a second. All those in favor say yes. All those opposed? It's unanimous. Thank you, Superintendent Mahoney. And also, just pause the timer for just a second, if anyone has clicker number 229, please return that to the back of the hall at someone else's. Superintendent Mahoney, sorry for the interruption, go ahead.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kevin Mahoney - 1396</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Thank you, Mr. Tost. I'm accompanied tonight by the school business manager, Nikki Andrade, who will be with me in case there are questions that we need to work through. As Mr. Tost mentioned, my name is Kevin Mahoney. I'm serving as the interim superintendent, and I'll be leaving June 30th of this year. But we are anxious and looking forward to welcoming Heidi Driscoll, who will be taking over the position of superintendent director on July 1, and we're all very much looking forward to her and her leadership taking Minuteman into the next chapter. So I just want to thank town meeting for the opportunity to offer a few comments on our budget and assessment, and we'd like to make sure we answer all questions with the hope of receiving an affirmative action by town meeting. Next slide, please. So our overall operating budget that we're proposing for next fiscal year is $31,517,219. That's about just under 4% over fiscal year 24. Next slide, please. So just breaking down that, when we look at just our operating recommendation, that's about $24,160,000, which is slightly under 3% for our operating side. Our capital recommendation is about $1,660,000. That's up significantly in terms of a percent over fiscal 24. But the reason, the major reason for that is we've, over the last couple of years, have been setting aside about $500,000 in our capital stabilization fund to make sure that we continue to maintain the building that was supported by Arlington and the other member towns back about seven or eight years ago. It's been on line now five years, which is, time flies from my perspective, and it's important that we move forward and maintain a capital stabilization fund that will be sufficient to meet future needs. So we've jumped that up from $500,000 to $850,000. In addition, we do have a building that we've used for various purposes over the last number of years. We call it the East Building. It's been used as a child care center. It's been used as a private elementary school. And we think there may be opportunities for Minuteman to use it in our daily operations, most notably for our animal science program. We currently have that in temporary space that's not in the main building. It's a relatively new program, being in its third year, and there may be opportunities through some type of a partnership or some type of enterprise to come in and collaborate with Minuteman and perhaps invest in that building for animal science clinic. Or there may be other opportunities that we're looking at, and those discussions are ongoing, but we want to make sure that Minuteman has the financial resources to be able to do that. With those comments, I want to make clear that at this point, in the short run, any renovation we do to that building would not necessarily translate into additional seats for in-district students. And then on the building project, we're about $5.7 million, 1.36% over fiscal 24. All of our debt is issued on the school building project, and we would expect that to sort of stabilize moving forward. Next slide, please. As we talk about the assessments, our assessment is about $25.7 million, which is 0.82%. That's an unusually low assessment number. It's not one I would suggest people get accustomed to. I think there were some anomalies that happened in this fiscal year and next fiscal year that has artificially suppressed that number this year. One of the points that Mr. Toste made about the school district offsetting the debt service associated with the athletic fields by using our revenue that we generate through the rental of the facilities was an impact, a first-year impact in this assessment. But now that that's going to be moving forward, that'll just be continued. I think in year one, it had a bit of an impact. I think that what we're going to see over time, and we'll demonstrate this in a few minutes, that out-of-district students' enrollment is reducing, which is a good sign in terms of getting more in-district students involved in opportunities for vocational technical education. But on the other hand, the revenue that's paid through that tuition has offset member town assessments, and we're going to see that diminish over time. When we talk about the assessment to Arlington, it's about $8.6 million. That's a decrease of about $370,000 over fiscal year 24. A lot of that's based on the enrollment trend. That's the number that we'll be asking for your affirmative action tonight. Next slide, please. Just a sort of a breakdown, high-level breakdown, based upon the assessment components. The required minimum contribution is the larger number at $3.4 million. That's generally determined under the school aid Chapter 70 formula. And just to point out, the building project, that service line, that second-to-last line of $1.8 million, that was exempt from the tax levy through a debt exclusion override that was voted by the town. Next slide, please. We did meet back in early March with the Finance Committee, and it had a very productive and engaged discussion. Some of the drivers of our budget, when we look at the salary, is our collective bargaining agreement at 3.5% plus steps. We did reduce a couple of administrative positions, but we did bring back positions that we had to reduce due to COVID, a couple of aides and a co-op coordinator. We've seen our co-op placement rise substantially, which is also very good, a very positive step. We had, because of enrollment, we had to add an unbudgeted foreign language teacher this year. We were able to absorb that within the operating budget, and we're continuing that position. And our student activity, as far as our athletic program, is really incredibly high, and we're adding an athletic trainer to support, manage that program, and comply with our MIAA rules. A couple of, next slide, please, a couple of other drivers is our non-salary, is our transportation, utilities. We were able to level fund our health insurance, because we had a better result this year, and we're focusing on cybersecurity. Next slide, please. As I mentioned before, we've invested in our capital stabilization account, the debt service we talked about with offsetting the fields, and we're making a little bit higher contribution to OPEB. Next slide, please. On our overall enrollment, you'll see that the red line, the blue line on the top is the overall enrollment. The red line is the in-district enrollment, and the green line is the out-of-district enrollment. As you can see, going back over the last six years, we had about 234 non-member students. It's now 37. So that corresponds with the reduction in the revenue we anticipate. Next slide, please. This is just an enrollment analysis by town. As you can see, Arlington has, as of October 1, 215 students. We're anticipating for next year we have 45 accepted students coming in, which will be a slight decrease to Arlington. In our discussions with the Finance Committee, we did provide sort of a three-year forward-looking document, and if we tend to see that enrollment stay at that mid-40s level, we should not anticipate a lot of spikes in the Arlington assessment, given those assumptions. Next slide, please. Again, these are some of the points that we talked about with the out-of-district tuition going down. That will have an impact on assessments. It's just sort of a forewarning, because we're seeing those students that are currently enrolled, those numbers are starting to drop over the next couple of years. I just wanted to make a couple of comments on the cost, the per-pupil cost for Minuteman. We had a discussion, again, with the Finance Committee and our other member towns that Minuteman is the highest per-pupil cost vocational school in the state. A lot of the factors that are driving that are teacher salaries, competitive within our member towns, our cost of special education. We have 40% of students that receive services, and our transportation costs, due to the geographical location of the district, with the school being on the easterly side, our transportation costs are rather expensive. That concludes my comments, and we would ask for your affirmative action on the assessment. Thank you.</blockquote>

The superintendent was already authorized to speak from the first night of town meeting, and so he is doubly authorized, but that doesn't give him twice the time. Okay, so we'll now turn over to the speaker queue, and we'll start out, again, with two speakers announced at a time. First Mr. Benson, and then Mr. Rudiman. Mr. Rudiman, if you could find the seat with the pink signs, we'll call them the hot seats, maybe. We'll see if that works. Mr. Benson, you have the floor.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 199</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Good evening, everyone. You know, when Arlington looks at itself, we compare ourselves to a mix of other communities in many ways to see how we're doing. In this instance, I thought it would be interesting to compare how Minuteman is doing financially to the nearest Vo-Tech to it, Shosheen Valley Tech. Here's what I found comparing the budget we've seen tonight to Shosheen Valley Tech's budget. The cost per pupil for our town in this budget is $39,824 per year. The cost per pupil for Billerica, which is the largest contributor to Shosheen Valley Tech, is $23,700 per year. That's a difference of $16,124 per pupil per year. Arlington has 215 pupils at Minuteman Tech. Multiply that to the difference and you get an additional amount that Arlington's paying compared to what Billerica's paying per student of $3,466,660 per year. So it's not only the most expensive Vo-Tech school. It's by far much more expensive than Shosheen Valley, a nearby tech. So I have a few questions I'd like to ask Mr. Mahoney, if I might, Mr. Moderator. Yes, please, Mr. President. Go ahead. Thank you. Is 686 students the maximum capacity at Minuteman?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge that we have with reducing expenses is we do have increased enrollment and we need to support that increased enrollment. I'm not sure about the source of your numbers, but if you're just simply taking the bottom line of assessments, I don't believe, and I could be wrong, but I don't believe that Shosheen's carrying debt service to the level that we're carrying debt service. And I think you alluded to like a $3 million variance, and if Shosheen is not carrying any debt service, 1.8 of it is related to the debt service that we talked about in the cost components. So without knowing the complete breakdown, I couldn't, I can't really respond to that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we've been in an environment now where we're seeing enrollment increase, and in that type of environment, it's a little bit difficult to be trying to. You didn't give us a breakout of the budget, so it was a little difficult to look behind these numbers and see what they were. I took a look at the breakout that Shosheen gives to its member communities, and there's much more detail, so it was much easier for me to look at that. So I would appreciate if next year we get a better breakout of the budget. How much state aid does Minuteman get annually that goes into the budget?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Al Tosti - 115</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a couple of explanations. One is Minuteman represents a much, much wealthier district than Shosheen. Shosheen's district is fairly middle class. When you throw in towns like Dover and Weston, Arlington's actually one of the poorest towns in Minuteman, and the state aid is largely based on, to a certain degree, on wealth. The wealthier your property tax base, the less state aid you're going to get. One of the other elements in comparison is, I can't remember the exact enrollment at Shosheen, but it's much bigger. You have a much smaller school, and with a larger school, you have certain benefits of size. So those are just two thoughts to keep in mind.</blockquote>

Michael Ruderman, Precinct 9, and speaking for myself and not for the Finance Committee, if we could return to the presentation that we just saw, could you bring up the slide again about the different trend lines in the enrollments, students coming from in-district towns versus students coming from out-of-district towns? Well, I'll get started. I believe the numbers I saw were approximately the school year 2016, 238 students from out-of-district within reasonable approach of the number of students from in-district towns. This year, fall into 37. Mr. Mahoney, were any out-of-district students accepted for the incoming class in this last year of applications?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kevin Mahoney - 268</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we received 175 in-district applications. All of those applications were accepted. A recommendation was made to the school committee back in the fall to limit our accepted applications to 175, so it just happened to come in at that level at our initial level. acceptance. We've had about seven or eight of those students decline their acceptance and as of this point we and we're following up on some late applications from in-district member town students in awaiting their decisions we have not accepted any out-of-district students as of this time. No acceptances for out-of-district students. I would consider this to be a promise fulfilled. Those of us who were part of the campaign to secure your agreement to the part of the debt for the new Minuteman school building one of the one of the arguments we made in fact one of the slogans were used was give us a building that was worthy of the education happening inside and we will fill it we will fill it with students from our own district and that has happened. Part of the increase in in the member towns assessments has been the increasing numbers of students from the member towns and conversely so many fewer students from out-of-districts that paid an increment above the tuition which lessened the impact on the member towns assessments. The new building is beautiful if you've had an opportunity to see it I know you'll agree with me if you haven't you are I urge you and invite you to make an opportunity to get a look at it in action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the debt services specifically related to the building the commitment at the time we sought the authorization for the bonding was the debt service related to the the fields would be offset by revenue collected by the by the rentals of the facilities. In some cases there are other costs that are that are covered by the renters such as the lights that they use that the maintenance over time that's incurred and some overhead costs as far as the operating costs of the field it's basically those costs that be associated with whether we were running them or not off hours.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I comment generally speaking on a statewide basis that there is some activity going on around proposed legislation that will change the way many most vocational technical schools go through their admissions process where we go through and many others go through a five stage process in reviewing an application and getting acceptance. A lot of those points relate to tuition, conduct, grades, letter of recommendation from the sending district counselor and an interview with with our admissions director and there's some activity about whether or not that's that's fair or whether that's that's holding down some disadvantaged class of students and there's a proposed lottery system that's being out there but that has not affected at this point Minuteman and to the point where we were able to accept all of our in-district applications this year so it's not necessarily an issue for Minuteman but it's certainly an issue statewide because the demand for vocational education exceeds the number of seats that are available in most most school regional vocational technical school districts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah I think it's the it's the of the five criteria there needs to be certain level of standard. What we really concentrate on I think in the interview process is a willingness of the students who want to pursue a vocational technical education. Sometimes in in having those interviews you could tell why the students there. Conduct's a big issue too. Many of our shops handle power tools and things of that nature and we want to make sure that student conduct is appropriate for that environment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's still way too early. We're guesstimating right now that it's a 16,000 square foot building and we're thinking it's about a thousand thousand dollars a square foot to renovate. So there may be some phasing of that because of the way the buildings laid out. There's a wing with 10,000 square feet and another wing with 6,000 square feet. So depending on the opportunities we'd like to see if there's a way that we can do that through our own stabilization funding perhaps some state capital grant funds maybe a partnership. We could have an industry partner participate as well but I think it would be a challenge for the district to ask the member towns for an investment in that at least at this point without either offering a new program that might attract new students or some type of a opportunity for increased enrollment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you so much for for taking my presentation tonight. My name is Laura Kiesel I am an Arlington resident of precinct 7 and tonight. I will be presenting on article 16 The humane pet shop warrants Which is basically a prohibition or a ban on the sale of live pets in Arlington Next slide, please So just a quick overview This prohibition will not apply to animal shelters or private breeders selling directly to people or households It would enable partnerships between pet shops and animal rescues so that those animal rescues could use those spaces in pet stores To adopt out pets as is occurring In next door in Cambridge at pet smarts where they have enacted a similar pet ban that we are attempting tonight And this is essentially a preventative measure Currently 14 municipalities in the Commonwealth have enacted a pet sale ban of some sort including the state of New York So we want to make sure that as that market shrinks, it does not shift into Arlington This is basically about addressing the issue of pet mills and poaching animals from the wild next slide, please So currently there are no pet shops in Arlington that sell live animals We do have a pet code, but it only sells goods and services But again, we want to make sure that that pet code does not expand to sell animals or that another pet store does not move in next slide, please So 2.6 million puppies are born from puppy mills every year in the United States and there's a competitive rate for kittens as well But meanwhile, there are 1 million dogs and cats that are euthanized every year in the United States So what we are trying to address is the issue of too many animals and too few homes next slide, please So in attempting to not add to that surplus, we don't want to just emphasize puppies and kittens But this is it an issue that affects all animals that are popularly sold as pets including mammals birds reptiles amphibians and fish and that is why This warrant is comprehensive to include all of those and that ladder provision Provision for fish was added in at the select boards recommendation. Next slide, please So why not just mammals? So just as there are puppy and kitten mills there are actually pet mills for every type of pet that is popularly sold as In pet stores, there are parrot mills. There are reptile mills There are even multi-species mills and these are large industrial sized mills and warehouses where animals are kept by the hundreds or thousands in cramped filthy cages in Addition to being very stressful and cruel for the animals themselves This also makes it more likely that there will be a disease outbreak that can jump to and impact people Birds reptiles amphibians and fish are not protected by the Animal Welfare Act As dogs cats and rabbits are so these animals actually need additional protections Also reptiles birds and fish and amphibians suffer extremely high mortality rates that are the ones that are sold in pet stores 70 to 75 to 90 percent die either before the point of sale or within their first year of purchase Many of the animals that are milled are actually poached from the wild and this is Causing the endangerment of these animals and their native ecosystems Some examples of that are the African gray parrot and the Madagascar radiant tortoise and this is adversely impacting our global biodiversity next slide, please When it comes to fish Currently 1 billion fish from 5,400 species are traded in the ornamental fish trade Globally every year and the United States by far is the number one importer of fish and the demand for pet fish is Contributing to the degradation of our coral reefs which are critical for ocean health and a livable climate next slide, please The other problem is that former pets are becoming invasive species Because so many people cannot care for these animals or they don't have the homes for them What happens is they wind up? Releasing them into our environment where they are becoming invasive species and are encroaching on our native species Currently, there are 56 species of pet birds in the United States, including in the Northeast and Massachusetts one prominent example of that is the monk parakeet pictured on top right and Also for turtles the red-eared slider 12 years ago You could buy several red-eared sliders at any pet store in Massachusetts But 10 years ago They had to ban their sale because people were releasing them by the hundreds to thousands in our ponds and riverways where they have now established breeding populations And they are crowding out our native turtles many of which are Endangered or threatened and even though that pet sale ban has helped a little bit. There are emerging threats with other pet turtles And that native that red-eared slider pictured their bottom Right is actually one here in Arlington at the Mystic River. Next slide, please The same applies to fish the most notorious and ubiquitous Example of that are the goldfish that have also been released by the thousands into our native waterways where there are Crowding out and out competing our native fish and other aquatic species and driving them to the brink of extinction Next slide, please So we have widespread support for this warrants dozens of Arlington residents signed our warrant petition the select board favored it with a unanimous 5 to 0 vote in favor and Expanded its protections to also encompass fish. We have the Support of the MSPCA the Animal Defense League the bottom Boston Animal Rescue League But additionally we also have the support of many smaller dog and cat rescues as well as the two major rabbit rescues the two major parrot rescues that service, Massachusetts and The Turtle Rescue League, which is the leading wildlife rehabilitation facility for turtles in Massachusetts and Have noted the impact of pet turtles on turtle species and they take in pet turtles to try to Mitigate that impact, but unfortunately all of these rescues are inundated and they note that pet shop pets are a big part of that problem So we hope that tonight the town meeting will also support this warrant and it's a riddle original iteration and make sure that this includes Comprehensive protections for all the species that were included. Thank you very much for your time</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Mustafa Varuglu precinct 10. I've put in an amendment to this article to basically room I'm sorry. I've put in an amendment into this to this article to remove birds reptiles amphibians and fish and leaving mammals as the prohibited animals as The article states so I want to recognize a few things as I as I stand here There are as mentioned no pet shops in Arlington. So and this article and amendment Would not address a current problem and we may never have a pet shop in this town I do want to point out we do have a bait shop that has been here for generations I don't know if this article will or will not affect the bait shop in East Arlington So there may be an immediate effect from this article if Fisher retained on the article I also want to recognize that animal cruelty is a terrible thing and The organizations that support this article are doing great work and I fully support reducing animal cruelty, though I do think this article goes too far in terms of reducing options for people and attacks the problem at the wrong end My motivation is that as I mentioned It's based on personal reasons and just as general principle that at some point It will be very hard for people to get pets other than dogs cats and rabbits from Shelter rescue shelters, and I think we're gonna lose a lot of opportunities to learn about other animals So when you look at some of these other animals there and I've worked at pet shops as a teenager and into my 20s and And you'll hear from other reasons. We've been you know, frequenting other pet shops there there are some animals that basically it's very hard to get any kind of selection from that's not at a pet shop if This is something that interests your family or may interest your family in the future You're basically going to reduce the opportunity to have access to these and it's a very homogenous world will end up in I guess When you're at pet shops, you get a chance to observe the animals learn and choose more specialized species if that's in your interests So specifically for my family my two daughters at different times wanted lizards. We went to a good pet shop Jabberwock formerly in Winchester now still in them Wanted you know, they spoke with the owners one of them was going to get a chameleon She was sat in a chameleon. She realized that that was the wrong pet for her. She did not want that She wouldn't be able to care for it properly. She switched directions got a different time. She got a gecko The other daughter wanted a bearded dragon had done a lot of research and that was confirmed by being at the pet shop There was a photo of bearded dragons shown in the previous slide when they're young They congregate when they're older they they go their own way and don't they actually fight if they get together? So that was fairly normal what was shown in that photo? I'd also like to point out that when we go to a pet shop there's a little knowledge of the breeding history of the animals that you're looking at and as people that have also have a dog and A cat or a cat and a bird from individual breeders We have very little knowledge of the heritage of the animals that we got I don't think there's a big difference frankly for the layperson to know what they're getting Whether it's from a breeder or a pet shop, and I think singling out pet shops is a disadvantage We Were asked very rudimentary questions by the breeders that we went to for the animals we got Frankly, we have a far better relationship with the pet shop and far more feedback and learning from them than we have from individual breeders And I will just bring up quickly That I Think people would be able to keep a much wider variety of pets if this article does not pass And I think there's a better way to deal with animal cruelty Which is to go to the source of it and legislate for these animals if the moderator would allow there is a town resident who has a lot of experience in the field of fish and aquariums as a Environmental consultant George Buckley would he be allowed to speak during this time to my man is a town resident Yes, he's a town resident.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is George Buckley a member of precinct 16 for many decades Thank you for allowing me to speak this evening I come here to very strongly ask you to vote for the the amendment is proposed by mr. Uglu or Vote no on on on article 16. The reason my main reason is fish should never have been included Simon Calamari who some of you may know as a major author natural history writer Wrote a great award-winning book Amazon Adventure and in it She talked about a tiny fish is helping to save the Amazon and that tiny fish is the cotton Leon Tetra That tiny fish is harvested locally by local village people who then work to protect that environment the water and the jungle Those fishes are exported and sold around the world And if we continue to ban this type of thing those villages those Amazon areas will be lost I worked on that project with New England Aquarium staff for 20 years Scott Dow some, you know, Danny Laughlin and it's been a huge success There's other programs like that that have been huge successes in breeding fish 90% of the fish sold and pet shops or through the internet are fresh water Over 95% of those are bred in captivity. I've worked on those projects often and regularly in my career and What what's interesting is even marine tropicals now are bred in captivity the clownfish for instance I worked on with Fleet Cousteau and dr. David Vaughn it at Harbor Ranch photographic 95% now bring captivity there are solutions to this problem, but it can't be done quickly We need to vote the article down and rewrite sections over the summer allowing only naturally sustainably harvested fish From the wild and naturally bred fish to be sold it's critical that we not shut off avenues like this young aquarists who started breeding and Zebra fish 30 or 40 years ago led to MIT being able to have the world's top zebrafish Study and breeding facility. They went to the Boston Aquarium Society Local people like you and I that had home aquaria that knew how to breed those fish So they could learn how to do it and we've got to be really careful in trying to do something good But we don't do bad in the end is sub cautionary principle due to harm So I'd ask you to vote 16 down vote for the minute amendment if you can't vote for the moment vote 16 dollars Rewrite that so it's a much better much more workable things And we have been selling fish for decades here already in East Arlington with the bait shop there Unfortunately, it's closed right now to a family illness, but I was hoping to have them come chat with you about that</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carrie Thiel precinct 10. I will be brief. I Spent the last 25 years Working in the animal welfare field on an unrelated issue My non-profit organization, which is an international organization that works on an animal welfare issue is a stone throw from this debate tonight Although I've not worked on this issue. I have been around people who have worked on This pet shop and overpopulation issue over the last two decades And it's been a part of my life my mother as I was growing up Constantly was rescuing dogs. I grew up in a house with six eight ten dogs. I broke up a lot of dog fights I can tell you Now she rescues cats. I'm sure Paul my good friend Paul appreciates that as a cat owner I can't I'm not gonna say how many cats she has but she has a lot There are so many people in our community who literally bend over backwards and make so many Sacrifices to help animals dying in shelters because there are still today a lot of animals Dying in shelters close to a million animals a year Nationally are dying in shelters thousands of animals dying shelters in Massachusetts And there has been years and years of policy work on this issue because at some point people said you know What I am tired of going to the shelter week after week after week and saving as many as I can While others die and so very smart policy solutions have been crafted around this issue Article 16 is a great example of that. This is didn't come out of nowhere This is something that people have been working on and fighting for for again for decades. There are laws being fought for at the federal level on this issue at the state level and at the local level and I would also just say to me. This is about who we are. It's not just about helping animals. It's not just about Stopping that pet overpopulation, but it's a reflection of our values That's why I am so proud that my nonprofit is based here. It's why I am so proud that Arlington has time and again stood with the animals on the greyhound racing vote, on the trapping ballot vote, on the article a few nights ago. Time and again, you have been here for the animals and I ask you to be there again for the animals tonight and support this good warrant article. Finally, I, you know, I was going to address the bait shop issue. I'm grateful for the town council who clarified that. This also will not prohibit the breeding of fish, will not prohibit the private sale of fish. None of the things that were talked about are addressed, that were raised earlier, are addressed by this warrant article, none of them. This is a carefully crafted warrant article and as Laura said in presenting this, it was the select board that said, can we make this stronger? That is something I'm appreciative of and grateful for. So, I ask you, please, vote yes on this article, vote down the amendment and cast another good vote tonight for the animals.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Xavid Pretzer - 347</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I just want to reiterate, you know, this is not. Yeah, I think the animal cruelty aspects of the main motion are very compelling. I also just want to reiterate the ecological impact. You know, stray cats and dogs are a big issue but also when reptiles, amphibians, fish are released into the wild that can really be devastating to native species. We have a lot of problems with our natural areas in Arlington and in our vicinity and I think we need to be doing more to support and safeguard our native species and I think this is one way of doing that. When people, pets sold at pet stores are more likely to be impulse purchases that people might not know what they're getting into. Like, I'm glad some people have had great experiences at pet stores but there are plenty of people that have had not been informed when buying a pet at a pet store and then later are unable to care for it or unwilling to care for it and it is released in the wild and it can cause great damage to our environment. I also wanted to remind everyone that this ban is limited to retail pet stores. You can still purchase cats, dogs, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians from private breeders in addition to rescue sites. I know we're all more familiar with cat and dog rescues but there are plenty of opportunities for rescuing other types of animals either via the internet or via specialized rescues. So, I do not think passing this measure will prevent anyone from obtaining a pet lizard, a pet fish, a pet snake. If that's what they want, they might make it. You might need to do a bit more research but I think before acquiring a pet like that, you should be doing your research anyways and so I think that's a win both for lovers of, you know, more unusual pets and for our environment. So, I urge you to vote against the amendment and for the main motion. Thank you.</blockquote>

I think the proponents have a good purpose which is to prevent animal cruelty which we all care about or should. But I don't think that government succeeds by telling 40,000 people you can't have pets if we want to prevent cruelty to animals. I would ask that you vote no on this article and seek instead a way for Arlington to improve the safety and health of animals, not to go for something like they have here. Should we be preventing people from eating meat because we don't think it's right? Should we be legislating a limit that is not intended to stop harm? It's simply going to stop business and people from enjoying pets. So, I ask you to vote no. Thank you.</blockquote>

All those in favor say yes. Yes. All those opposed say no. No. Debate is terminated. So, we will first vote on the Variglou Amendment. So, everyone should have a copy of this. So, we're not going to run through it in detail, but it's essentially removing birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish from the prohibition, leaving just mammals. Okay. I think we're still letting folks in the speaker queue, but. So, if we can bring up a vote on the Variglou Amendment. Okay. Voting is now open. If you're in favor of the Variglou Amendment to retain the ban on the sale of mammals, but to remove the ban on birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, vote one for yes. If you want to leave birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish in the ban, press two for no, or three to abstain. Okay. Voting will close shortly. Okay. Let's close voting. And the motion fails. 79 in the affirmative, 130 in the negative, three abstentions. So, the main motion remains unamended, not amended. So, now let's take a vote on the main motion under Article 16, which is still the recommended vote of the Select Board. And so, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but this voting is open now. So, if you're in favor of amending Title I of the Town Bylaws to add a new provision to ban the sale of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish in pet shops within the town, press one for yes. If you're opposed to that ban, press two for no, and three to abstain. And this is a majority vote. Okay. Voting is closed.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us to Article 20, home rule legislation related to the town clerk's position. Mr. DeCourcy? Thank you, Mr. Moderator. The select board moves to favorable action by unanimous vote. This is the home rule legislation that would convert the town clerk position from an elected position to an appointed position. We've acted on this previously at town meeting. The referendum this April, voters approved it by a 59% was the favorable vote on that. And what it requires is an act of, we need legislative approval to approve the amendment to the Town Manager Act. And I will say that this language is identical to what we used or very similar to what we used when we converted the treasurer's position from an elected position to an appointed position. Okay, one second. Okay, and we have a motion from, an amendment from Mr. Worden. Mr. Worden, did you want to introduce your amendment? And also before, as Mr. Worden's making his way up, can we show the speaker queue, please? It was just recently cleared and we have two names on there. Okay. And then let's switch back now to Mr. Worden's amendment under Article 20. Mr. Worden, can you just take the microphone down? There you go, thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Worden - 445</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I know some people have been having, some people including me have been having difficulty hearing the microphone, so I hope everybody can hear me. If you can't hear me, raise your hand. Okay. Well, my amendment would simply provide that although the town clerk would be appointed by the manager, that person should be a resident of the town of Arlington. And I say that because I think of all the many officials we have appointed and elected that the average citizen comes in contact with, the town clerk and her staff are the face of the town for most people. It starts, if you're born, when you're born, your parents come in, maybe you get a birth certificate. At the other end, after you die, your children come in to get a death certificate. If you want to vote, you have to come into the clerk's office to register. If you want to get, like all few folks did want to run for town meeting, you come to the town clerk's office to get your nomination papers and then you go back there to file them. And so it's different and you may never have occasion to meet with the select board members or the manager or the treasurer. You might go into the treasurer's office to give one of the clerks some money, like we all did last week or early this week. But it's the town clerk's offices where practically everybody has to go one time or another. And so I think it's important that that one that interfaces most with the public should be one of the people in our town. And I mean, we had an extraordinary case where the town clerk was summoned from her home early in the morning because of a prospective bridegroom who forgot to get a marriage license. But she came down to town hall and helped him. Now, if the town clerk was somebody who was appointed from, I don't know, any Bill Ricker or somewhere, would they do that? Well, maybe, maybe not. And it seems to me that this town of 46,000 people, of whom probably 20-some thousand are adults, that the talent and requirements to serve as town clerk could be found without, you don't have to go have a worldwide search to find someone who would be that kind of person who would be a good town clerk. So, and I think we ought to have at least one of our officials, somebody who lives in the town, knows the town, has been familiar with it, and knows its people. So I ask you to support my amendment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I received this question by email, and Mr. Cunningham, feel free to add to it, that based on context and also history, which would be taken into account, if this got litigated, there would be a very clear case that contextually it applies only to the clerk's position. Mr. Cunningham, is there anything to add to that?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Cunningham - 479</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. So, there are two reasons for us to have an appointed clerk. The first reason to have an appointed clerk is because it allows us to put a professional into what is an operational position, not a policymaking position where we would normally want someone who represents us, who therefore is a resident of the town and who's familiar with the culture of the town and the town's needs and so on and so forth, in the position. It's a purely operational position. The second reason that we want an appointed clerk is because we do want to be able to search for that professional outside the borders of the town. When you go to the clerk's office, what you want is good service professionally provided and when you are submitting documents or we finish the business of the town meeting and home rule petitions have to be filed and so on and so forth, you want to know that the person in the clerk's office knows how to handle all the intricacies of that job and make sure that all of that goes well and that our records are preserved properly and so on and so forth. It might be true that on a Sunday morning when somebody needs their marriage license and they forgot to get it, that if the clerk lives in Cambridge, they couldn't get here and might or might not be motivated to get here really quickly. But in the meantime, all the other business of the clerk's office will be running well if we are able to choose our clerk from amongst the best possible candidates interested in the job regardless of whether or not they live in the town. This is not a position where when it was an elected position, you had any idea what the clerk was doing in between elections because the clerk holds no public meetings. Similar to the treasurer's office, these were not offices where it was clear to the public what the person in the office was doing unless they went to the treasurer's office to pay a bill or they went to the clerk's office to get their dog license. And even then, you don't really know everything that's going on behind the scenes. You can't tell when you pay your. tax bill what the treasurer's investment policy is. You can't tell when you go to the town clerk's office to get your dog license whether or not home rule petitions have been properly filed. We need professionals in this position. We need to be able to seek the best possible professional and therefore we should not hamper our hiring capability by adding Mr. Warden's amendment to this article. However, we should pass the main motion as presented by the board of selectment or select board. I'll never get that right. Thank you.</blockquote>

And it's terminated. 146 in the affirmative, 65 in the negative. So we'll first vote on the warden amendment. And so the warden amendment would add the restriction that the appointed town clerk needs to be a resident of Arlington. Okay. Voting is open. If you're in favor of Mr. Warden's amendment to limit the appointed clerk's position to a resident of Arlington, you'd press one for yes. Press two to reject that amendment and three to abstain. Okay. Let's close voting. And the amendment fails. 52 in the affirmative, 162 in the negative, two abstentions. Let's bring up a vote now on the main motion under article 20. Which would authorize the select board to file. Voting is open. So you'd press one if you wish to authorize the select board to file home rule legislation to amend the Town Manager Act to convert the town clerk from an elected to appointed position. Press two for no, to not authorize the select board to do that and three to abstain. Okay. Let's close voting.

We thought originally there was going to be a substitute, but just for the town meetings, for clarification purposes, this article was put in initially by the town manager because there was some uncertainty as to how a senior citizen exemption would be applied next year where the funds would come. As a result of meetings that we had with the assessors and further clarification, the funds would come out of the overlay account, so there's no action required by town meeting. And for that reason, the town manager recommended that we vote no action, and we did that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That takes us to Article 22. Mr. DeCorsi. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Move to postpone Article 22 until Monday evening. And the reason for that is that the proponent of that is a student at the high school. She's not here this evening. She made a very compelling presentation to us, and I believe she would like to make the same presentation to town meeting. It was an expectation that we wouldn't reach that article this evening. For that reason, I'd like to give her that opportunity, of course, with the town meeting's approval. So, what precisely is the motion? Is it to postpone? This is to postpone until Monday evening. But it is budget night on Monday evening, so is there a particular article before which or after which? Yeah, well, we're thinking after budget, maybe. Hang on one second, Mr. Moderator. Maybe after the capital budget. Would that be too late? Mr. Diggins, I think, has context, because I believe he's been in touch with the speaker, with the resident. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Moderator.

After special town meeting on Wednesday? Yes. So, we have a majority vote, or a motion with a majority vote to postpone Article 22 until the dissolution of the special town meeting, or until after business of the special town meeting on Wednesday. There's reasons for that. And we have a second. All those in favor of that postponement say yes. All those opposed.

The CDBG committee had met several times over the spring to discuss awards of CDBG funds and tried to meet as many requests as possible. We anticipate receiving less funding in program year 50 than we did in program year 49 for a total of about $1,001,000. We broke that down into a few categories. One, under housing, $200,000 related to capital improvements for Caritas communities and the Housing Corporation of Arlington, public services. We've had several awardees who've been awarded in the past continuing their programs that have been so helpful in this community for a total of $151,000. Public facility improvements, mostly capital improvements related to ADA walkway in the Hauser building for the housing authority. Lower Millbrook flood resilience design, which is a green infrastructure project. And then continuing our program of ADA curb ramp installations to the tune of about $100,000. Total for public facilities improvements this year, about $450,000. And then planning and administration. We will offset salaries in the Department of Planning and Community Development, about $50,000. For planning studies, I've asked for $65,000 and it looks like they'd like to award me about $50,000. The grants administrator and general administration of the CDBG program makes up the rest of that funding for about $200,000 totals. And that brings us to about the $1 million figure that we will have to disperse this year. Thank you.</blockquote>

I've heard various stories from different sources that the nature of the funding for some types of projects involves a repayment period after 15 or 20 years. Is that true or is this purely a grant process and there's no repayment into the fund? Director Ricker or Mr. Feeney, do you have an answer? Thank you. Claire Ricker, Director of Planning and Community Development. It is my understanding that these are grants and are not subject to repayment unless we were to take out a loan to bond against our future grant awards, which is called I believe a Section 106 loan. We do not have any of those outstanding at this time. Okay. Thank you. And a fellow town meeting member was curious about the Foot of the Rocks Parklet. There's $200,000 being allocated to that. That's to be made a public gathering space at the intersection of Mass Avenue and Lowell Street. Has there been a lot of public? Oh, zero? The figure is zero, I believe. Was not approved.

I also just had a question, Mark, about the Arlington Eats coming in at a $0 amount. I just feel like the need is growing and the market is serving around 500 families a week now, which is a 50% increase from what it has been in the past. And while there are other opportunities to raise money for any nonprofit in town, this really feels like a core service that our town provides to the community. And it seems like there should be some form of kind of town buy-in into this program and this seems like a potentially good source for that. So I really hope that that can be considered in the future. And the other requests that were zeroed out, the Foot of the Rocks did get a big chunk of CPA money. And I guess Envision Arlington had funds left over from something else. So I just hope that can be taken into consideration in the future. Thank you.</blockquote>

The Cutter Gallery rentals with an expenditure cap of $15,000 and community center rentals with an expenditure cap not to exceed $50,000.

We can perform both basic life service or advanced life service. Typically, Armstrong Ambulance now takes all advanced life service ambulance rides. We take all basic life service. We used to report all of our ALS, so advanced life service revenue, into the revolving fund. We have a much lower revenue stream of ALS now. We have a much higher basic life service revenue stream. That goes into the general fund now. So it's a change in how we record our revenue. Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Moderator.</blockquote>

And I will be taking you through Warren's Article 25 building definitions. All right, do we have slides for these? There should be one PDF with all of the ARB slides in it. Yeah, Andrew, don't type. That it is. Don't type your password right now. Okay, next slide, please. All right, so Article 25 intends to clarify the zoning bylaw by refining the definitions of attached versus detached buildings. So this was proposed by the Zoning Board of Appeals. And the current definitions of attached and detached buildings in the zoning bylaw are not internally consistent, so that some buildings do not clearly fall into either category. So the revised definitions were written in consultation with the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Inspectional Services Department and are consistent with the manner in which ISD has been interpreting the zoning bylaw. So next slide. For other direction. Yep, one more. Excellent. So the proposed definition of a building attached would read a building having any portion of one or more walls or roofs in common with another adjoining building or buildings or otherwise connected by a roof to another building or buildings. So this defines attached buildings as sharing roofs or walls. So the proposed definition of building detached would read a building that does not meet the definition of building attached. So the redevelopment board voted five to zero at our April 1st meeting to recommend favorable action on Article 25. Thank you, Mr. Moderator.</blockquote>

So this article proposes to change an existing list of conditions in Section 592B1 from bullet points to letters to make it easier to refer to individual provisions of the Zoning By-law. This article would also delete a subsection from the by-law that is obsolete as it references dates that have passed. This article does not make any changes to the condition or rules under which accessory dwelling units are allowed, and this amendment was proposed by the Zoning Board of Appeals. So next slide. And one more. So the amendment text, here we see the bulk of the proposed change where bullet points have been replaced with letters, making individual provisions easier to reference or cite. Next slide. And here we see the deletion of a subsection that is obsolete as the effective dates have passed. So the dates reference the addition of the accessory dwelling units to the by-law, which were adopted by town meeting in the spring of 2021, and the six-month period referenced in item three has passed as well.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 183</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry, 26, 26, thank you. Mr. Benson. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Good evening, Eugene Benson from the Redevelopment Board. I'm going to take you through Article 26, which is just an administrative clarification to the zoning bylaw. Next slide, please. This article proposes to update the references to exceptions in the requirements for district yard and open space made in Section 5.4.2A by adding a reference to 5.9.2.B1E, an exception related to allowable setbacks for accessory dwelling units. The accessory dwelling unit exception reference exists elsewhere in the bylaw. So all this does is reference that there is an exception somewhere else in the bylaw. It does not change the substance of the bylaw at all. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. This just shows that we just add an additional reference to the existing code. This was recommended to us by the Zoning Board of Appeals to make it easier for them to do referencing back and forth. In their decisions, the ARB voted five to zero at our April 1 meeting to recommend favorable action on this article. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Benson. I see no names in the speaker queue, so we'll go directly to electronic vote on the main motion under Article 26. And so while that's coming up, we will, let's see. Yeah, this is a vote to amend Section 5.4.2A, our district yard and open space requirements in the zoning bylaw to reference an exception found elsewhere in the zoning bylaw. So if you're in favor of that change, that Mr. Benson described, press one for yes. If you're opposed to that change in the zoning bylaw, press two for no or three to abstain. This is a two-thirds vote. Okay, voting is closed. And the main motion passes, 211 in the affirmative, one in the negative, and two abstentions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much. So, again, I'm Eugene Benson from the Redevelopment Board. I'll be taking you through Warrant Article 28, which refers to the deletion of the Inland Wetland Overlay District. Microphone, please, Mr. Benson. Inland Wetland, sorry, Inland Wetland Overlay District for the, for this. So, thank you, slides. There is a supplemental report that's also been filed, so we made one additional change, so you might look at both of those. And Arlington has, thank you, Arlington has an Inland Wetland Overlay District that predates, by many years, the adoption of the State Wetlands Protection Act, which is implemented by the Arlington Conservation Commission. The Conservation Commission has robust authority to protect wetlands, and is the most appropriate body to do so, as the inclusion of the Inland Wetland District in the zoning bylaw has created confusion about the appropriate body to adjudicate wetlands. Inclusion of the overlay district in the bylaw gives the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Redevelopment Board overlapping and superfluous jurisdiction better served by the Conservation Commission. This article was proposed by the Zoning Board of Appeals and the Town's Conservation Agent, is supported by the Zoning Board of Appeals, Inspectional Services Department, Department of Planning and Community Development, and the Conservation Commission. If you have not already done so, please read the memo in the annotated warrant from the Planning Director, Claire Ricker, and the Town's Environmental Planner and Conservation Agent about why removing the Inland Wetland District, overlay district, is appropriate and necessary. Next slide. Next slide. All this shows is that we are deleting the reference to Inland Wetland District in the lists of overlay districts. Next slide. And then we're deleting the entire section on this. I'll just speak for a couple of minutes on my own since I have a few minutes left. For four years, I was the Executive Director of the Massachusetts Association of Conservation Commissions. We did training and advocacy for wetlands protection and open space protection. I took a really close look at this to make sure that by deleting the overlay for the wetland district from the Zoning By-law, we would not in any way be making wetlands protection less in the town. I took a really close look at this. This used to be my job for a few years. There will be no loss of wetlands protection by removing the overlay district. We'll just get rid of a lot of confusion. Our Conservation Commission, I've noticed from my years working on these things, is one of the best in the state. And this town has passed its own wetland by-laws to even strengthen the state by-laws. So I can assure you that this will have no negative impact on wetlands protection. I also spoke to a few people in town to say, has this by-law, Zoning By-law, ever been used to stop any sort of wetland development since the town has had a Conservation Commission and has its own wetland by-law, and it has never been used for that. So I urge you to support this change. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Benson. And Mr. Revillac, you had an amendment before. Am I correct that the supplemental report of the ARB that you handed in today subsumes that? Mr. Moderator, Steve Revillac, Precinct One Town meeting member, I would like to withdraw my amendment because it is subsumed by the supplemental report of the Arlington Redevelopment Board. No need to withdraw. It was not, it was not moved. Thank you. So we'll go to the speaker queue and we'll start with Mr. Hurd and then Mr. Lareddy. Mr. Lareddy and then Mr. Hallman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, Mr. Moderator. Chris Lareddy, Precinct Seven. I actually rise in opposition to this article and the proposed change. First, I think some of the information that was given to you I don't think is factually correct. The Wetlands Protection Act was passed in Massachusetts, as I understand it, in 1972. This section of the bylaw didn't apply or didn't come into effect until 1975. And it's remained in the bylaw consistently over the years, including six years ago when the zoning bylaw was completely recodified. It was looked at then. It was modified and it was left in. And if you noticed on the slides that Mr. Benson showed, there's also a floodplain district in there in the zoning bylaw. That, too, is something that the Conservation Commission deals with. I don't know why they didn't propose taking that out when they're proposing to take out this. Because the exact same arguments they're making for taking out this district could have been made for that district. I suggest to you there is one very good reason for keeping this in. And it's not necessarily to provide greater protection to the wetlands. It's to provide greater protection to the town for its permitting decisions. This is part of a zoning bylaw. When a developer goes before the redevelopment board for a special permit, this gets effectively incorporated into that special permit. So if a developer wants to challenge the permit, this is part of that. And I think as a matter, I would ask people if they can remember the last time a redevelopment board special permit has successfully been overturned in the courts. The last one that I can remember that was challenged at all successfully was the Sims redevelopment, probably 20 years ago. Now if you ask someone on the Conservation Commission how frequently their decisions are turned over. over, I think you'll find that it's far more frequently. I know there were some, for example, regarding developments along Spide Pond. So I would suggest that until we're really sure that this does provide the same level of protection to the town, not only in the administration of the wetlands bylaw, but also in preserving the town's power to regulate development, I think it should stay in. The other advantage it also has is a lot of these developments, if they implicate wetlands, they're going to be before both the Redevelopment Board and the Conservation Commission anyway. And as someone who's served on the Redevelopment Board, I can tell you there's never been any dissension or disagreement about how the Wetlands Protection Act should be applied. The board has always deferred to the Conservation Commission. But one thing this does, which frankly, I'm not sure the Conservation Commission likes, is it gets them into the process early. The Conservation Commission always takes the position that they're the last group that wants to look at a project. This is actually good in that it brings them into the process early when the Special Permit Granting Authority, in this example, the Redevelopment Board, is getting involved. So that if, instead of going through it in a sequential manner, going from the Redevelopment Board back to the Conservation Commission, which then may require changes that require the project to go back to the Redevelopment Board, this allows it all to be handled all at once. So I think I see some distinct advantages to keeping it in. My suggestion for the reason you're hearing so much about taking it out now is simply there's been quite a bit of staff turnover over the years and there hasn't been that institutional experience in understanding how the boards and commission work together to make this work effectively. So I'll be voting no on this. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Hellman and then Mr. Lewicki. Aram Hellman, Precinct 6. I appreciate what Mr. Benson said about making sure that no protections will be diminished. In many ways, I like this proposal. I am concerned about something on it and I'm wondering if I could ask a question of either Mr. Benson or somebody else qualified to answer. Of course. Your question? Okay. In what is being proposed to eliminate the inland wetland district, there's words to the effect that land along perennial rivers, brooks, et cetera, are protected for a horizontal distance of 200 feet from the center line. Is there any flexibility in that 200 feet? Mr. Benson or Mr. Revellack? Okay. To the microphone, please. In what is proposed to be eliminated, is there any flexibility in that 200 foot distance?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson and Aram Hollman - 589</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we're proposing to eliminate it. The town wetland bylaw retains the 200 foot distance, so that's where one would look if there was any question. I understand that that's what you're proposing to eliminate, but when I look in the section of Article 8 Wetlands Protection, I just want to quote from that. The commission there may require that the applicant maintain a strip of continuous, undisturbed, vegetative cover within the 200 foot riverfront area. So is that the same 200 feet? Yes. Okay. The difference that I notice is one particular word, and I want to emphasize it. The commission, that is the conservation commission, therefore may, emphasis, may require that the applicant maintain such a strip. And I'm reading that to mean it is at the discretion of the commission whether or not to do that within 200 feet. Now, I understand that the state law requires 100 feet of protection no matter what. Arlington, in its wisdom, in both of these provisions, for the ARB and, excuse me, the Zoning Board of Appeals, and for the conservation commission, extended that to 200 feet. The difference is that in the new wording that you are proposing, there is an element of discretion in enforcing that. I do not see that element of discretion in what is being proposed to eliminate. Am I correct in interpreting that? You know, I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Holman, because to my knowledge, the ARB has never implemented this, and the Zoning Board of Appeals has never implemented it because it's so confusing about how to do it. Both boards have generally deferred to the conservation commission. During my seven years on the redevelopment board, it has never come up. I understand that, but at the same time, you said you had taken great care to make sure that there would be no diminishment of any conservation protections, and as I'm reading it, I am seeing in what you're proposing to delete an absolute requirement for 200 feet, whereas in the new wording, I'm seeing a discretionary requirement of 200 feet, and I guess I'm interpreting that as exactly the kind of diminishment that concerns me. I can't give you a definitive answer without reading the conservation commission bylaw. I can just again tell you that it has never come up at the redevelopment board, or to my knowledge in speaking with the chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals, with the chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals. Okay. We have a difference in interpretation. It's a matter of interpretation. At this point, I'm not fully convinced that there will be no diminishment of conservation protection, and I think by switching from one jurisdiction by one regulating board to another, you are giving the conservation commission the discretion to enforce this for 200 feet, whereas in what exists, in what should be deleted, in what is proposed to be deleted now, that discretion is not there. So at this point, I think until that discrepancy can be resolved, I would urge you to vote against this. One possibility, and I realize we are not amending the conservation commission regulations right now, would be to change the conservation commission regulations to eliminate that word may and put in the word shall. And therefore, we would have the definitive, unconditional, unambiguous 200-foot protection that is in the regulations proposed to be eliminated. So I will be voting no on this and urge you to do the same. Thank you.</blockquote>
