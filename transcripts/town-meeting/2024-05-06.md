<summary>Annual Town Meeting Night 4</summary>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 667</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, it is Monday, May 6th, 2024, and I'm calling to order night four of Arlington's 2024 annual town meeting. Tonight is budget night at town meeting. We will cover... All right, settle down. We'll cover town budgets. You're a weird crowd. And the capital budget, which are articles 39 and 40. I'll have more to say about the budgets when we get there. In the meantime, please make sure you've found the corrections to the capital planning report. It'll be off of the town meeting page if you have an internet connection. Ms. Brazil, do we have printouts of that correction? Okay, we don't have printouts, but... Yeah. Actually, can we project the corrections while I give the rest of my remarks? Okay. On Wednesday, we will take up the special town meeting. There's obviously been a lot of attention on Article 5, the resolution which involves a very challenging subject matter. We're likely to have lots of guests in the gallery that night. There's going to be a lot of potential for heightened emotions. I'll have more to say Wednesday night, but I want everyone here now to consider tonight a dress rehearsal for appropriate behavior at town meeting. That means no shouting, no cheering, no applause, no booing. We'll act like responsible adults to keep the temperature down. Also, preparations are being made for Wednesday night to ensure safe entry and exit into and out of town hall, and to ensure everyone's safety within the building so that town meeting can do the business that we've been asked to do. For members of the public observing from the gallery, which are in the wings of the balcony, I want to remind you that there is no cheering, no shouting, no applause, no signs, no banners, no waving of flags, and certainly no interruption of speakers. Next, let's talk about terminating debate. I've gotten reports that there's been cheering and high-fiving when someone gets recognized to speak who intends to call for terminating debate. Let's remind everyone that town meeting is not a game. You are not fans in a stadium. You are elected representatives of your precincts, and you're expected to act like responsible and respectable adults. When you cheer or gloat, you are breeding bad blood with other town meeting members who disagree with you, and that hurts this institution. And there's another side of this issue. Terminating debate has a legitimate purpose. Less than one-third of the meeting does not have the right to hold more than two-thirds of the meeting captive to a debate that it does not want. There are numerous opportunities to get answers to questions before you step inside town hall. It's not reasonable to expect that you'll get all the answers you need for casting an informed vote sitting in those uncomfortable seats listening to dozens of speakers. And lastly, let's do a quick experiment. If you were born in a year that's an odd number, think what year you were born in. If it's an odd number, say yes. And if you're born in a year that's an even number, say no. Good. That's the volume you should use when I call for voice votes. I got a report that when I called for a voice vote last Wednesday, someone's health app on their phone alerted them about a dangerously loud noise that could impair their hearing. They sent me a screenshot. That's not how voice votes are supposed to work. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to start tracking how often my call of a voice vote is overruled by an electronic vote. And if I'm wrong too often, which generally happens when people on one side of the debate shout too much, then I'm going to stop taking voice votes, and we're going to be here longer than we otherwise would if folks just called out their vote at a reasonable volume. And with that, please rise for the National Anthem.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

Okay, and the question is, was our first annual town meeting in Arlington, or whatever this land was called at the time, within 30 years of the signing of the Declaration of Independence?

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. Just 60 seconds of your time. Dave Levy, Precinct 18. Good evening. I'm Dave Levy. I'm here to report from the Conservation Commission's hearing on Thursday night regarding the turf field for the high school. The results were there was a side that won and a side that lost. If you were a proponent of the high school field as originally constructed, I think it's fair to say you won. The permit was extended. And the field will be built as originally voted on by this town and others applauding the debt service. I want to raise a concern about what happened on Thursday night and echo that to you now as other elected officials. What I saw on Thursday night was an ask of volunteers and staff to start their proceeding not at 7 o'clock but at 945 at night, so taking up considerable amounts of their time, and debate a permit extension, not against existing law, but under law that does not exist and regulations that don't exist today. And once we move from existing law to subjectiveness, it creates a great danger for all of us as elected officials who must enact and make law. So to my fellow members on the select board, town meeting, I urge that you look at this seriously, because I was very concerned about what I saw, and I think it's only fair to people who volunteer their time in this effort that we apply the law in a transparent fashion. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator, and good evening, Town Meeting members. I would like to begin by thanking all of Arlington's taxpayers and voters for their support of our schools this past fall in the November override vote, and by thanking the Arlington School Committee for their support in the development of the school department budget that I will present on their behalf for your consideration tonight. Next slide. Our vision in the Arlington Public Schools provides a shared direction for the work of all 1,000 employees, 6,000 students, and thousands of Arlington families. We believe that all learners, and that includes all of us, deserve an opportunity to feel belonging in their learning environment, that belonging fosters growth through challenging learning experiences, and that through learning and connecting with one another, we can ensure all students are joyful and empowered in our schools every day. Next slide. Our strategic vision and priorities guide our budget development efforts every year, and this year's priorities are to fund fall override competitive compensation commitments, to plan for increasing electricity supply rates, to adjust elementary staffing levels according to enrollment, and maintain existing staffing to support special education and expanding secondary enrollment, and to continue implementation of our five-year strategic plan. Next slide. One of the many factors we have to consider when developing a budget is student enrollment. Enrollment is a pillar of the long-range plan formula that determines the town's appropriation to the school department. So this slide shows Arlington Public Schools' actual enrollment from FY 18 to 24, and our projected enrollments in the years to come using multiple formulas, which are expected to level out or decrease. The actual enrollment is the blue line. It is worth noting that birth rates are declining in this area, resulting in lower elementary enrollment and projections, and classes with significantly higher enrollment are moving into the upper grades, requiring shift in staffing allocations. Next slide. So this graph shows that. It demonstrates the tip we're seeing in elementary versus secondary enrollment, which explains reductions to elementary sections that you'll see in the FY 25 budget. You'll notice that secondary enrollments have only been and still are steadily increasing. That's the red line. Meanwhile, elementary enrollment stabilized in 2021 and are now slightly decreasing. This is important because there are licensure requirements, and they differ from elementary to secondary levels, requiring different staffing models, and we've proactively accounted for that trend using ESSER dollars. We saw it coming, and budget planning in our prior years to make sure we would have the resources to support this, even though ESSER funds were going away this year. Next slide. In the strategic planning process, APS identified focal groups of interest whose academic outcomes demonstrate an opportunity for us to improve. The focal groups are listed on this slide, and they include students and their families with IEPs who identify as Black or African American or Hispanic Latino, who identify as LGBTQIA+, who are multilingual learners or speak a language other than English as the primary language in the home, or who are identified as low-income by state agencies. Success of our plan is measured by all students thriving in their engagement, enrichment, and academic opportunities, and we try to set a high standard for the school system to meet the needs of all learners and to provide opportunities for any learners. Making that possible requires a lot of resources. Next slide. I'm pleased to report that we're already doing well towards the demands of this plan, even though it's only in its first year of implementation. On our 2023 accountability rating, before we were officially implementing the plan, APS earned the highest possible designation for a district of meeting or exceeding standards. The state accountability system measures progress towards targets that are designed to reduce opportunity gaps, and this rating is an indicator of progress in the right direction for APS towards meeting the needs of our focal groups and all students, and we're proud of the efforts of our educators, students, and families that made that possible. Next slide. This work also promises to continue to challenge us in the years ahead. Arlington is becoming more diverse with each passing year, and the needs of students and families has only increased following the pandemic. This graph shows how our populations of students who require additional services, including those focal groups I named earlier, have been steadily increasing since 2019. Next slide. The APS budget has also increased year over year to accommodate the needs in the school department. This slide shows that the bulk of APS funding comes from the town's support of our schools through the town allocation, which includes appropriation of Chapter 70 state aid to the community. Funding sources outside of the town's allocation include special revenue, grants, circuit-breaker reimbursements for out-of-district special education tuition, and in previous years, COVID-19 grants. This chart demonstrates the overall anticipated funding sources, including the town appropriations and other sources of revenue for FY25. Notable on this slide is the total increase to the school allocation of 5.89%, despite decreases in circuit-breaker and COVID-19 relief grants. Next slide. grants. That increase is therefore a significant testament to the dedication of Arlington's taxpayers to our schools and students. Next slide. This chart shows the proposed budget expenses by budget transfer categories within the school department. A couple of things to notice here. One is a contingency line. This represents dollars to be appropriated to salaries at the conclusion of collective bargaining and after position control is finalized with any positions that might be being eliminated next year. Also notable is a 12% increase to special education which we purposely targeted for additional investments. Next slide. This is a high-level summary of proposed changes to the FY25 school budget. Notable on this slide is dollars set aside for unit D salary increases. Following the successful override vote we bargained for additional working hours and historic increases to pay for some of our most critical and lowest paid employees which we're very proud of and 1.7 million set aside for collective bargaining with unit A. Also both efficiencies and additions to the FY25 budget. In accordance with past practice we have worked to be explicit about what we're eliminating from the budget as well as what we're adding in order to meet the needs of our students and be responsible with taxpayer dollars. Next slide. It's worth highlighting also that over the past three years we've used a combination of COVID infusion grant and operating funds in order to add positions at Arlington High School, OMS, and Gibbs in anticipation of incoming class sizes that would be bigger. Additional learning communities at OMS to prepare for those classes, increases to paraprofessional training and pay at monotony preschool, and balanced elementary class sizes. All of these commitments are maintained in the FY25 budget but they might not be immediately visible because they were built into the base using funds available in previous years. We hope this demonstrates a commitment to forward thinking and purposeful planning which have made it possible for Arlington to emerge from a challenging budget season and the pandemic with what we believe to be a supportive, reasonable, and responsible budget for FY25 that meets the commitments outlined in the strategic plan and promised to voters in the 2023 override campaign. It is my daily joy to lead our students in learning in the Arlington Public Schools and I'm grateful to all of you and the full Arlington community for its ongoing support and dedication to providing an excellent education for all APS students and I am happy to take any members questions. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Dr. Homan. Okay so the way budgets work which some of you know and some of you might not know is that we're gonna I'm gonna run through the budgets it's vaguely similar to the consent agenda where I'll run through I'll name the budgets. I did share a doc with the presentation folks just a moment ago if they check their email so I'll kind of run through the names of the budgets and you can also you can see these in appendix B in detail and the Finance Committee report and and you can request a hold if if no one holds a particular budget like say the education budget as an example then we will not debate that budget and we'll move on so we'll first go through and get the holds so we know what budgets we're gonna have debate on and then we'll go through those held budgets one by one and have separate debate on each of those and so we'll have like a speaker queue unless there's just like one speaker for a budget we might have we might open the live speaker queue and and then we'll have normal procedures like terminating debate but it won't be terminating debate on all matters under the article it'd be terminating debate on that particular budget and then we move on to the next budget. Let's see do we have that document ready and so there's no speaker queue yet it's just you just call holds and then we'll get to speaking after we deal with all the holds. Okay there it is. Can we zoom into that increase the size a little bit maybe under view zoom yeah maybe like 200% or more yeah okay there we go good okay so you'll have to scroll live as I run through these so again if you want to have debate or discuss a budget just yell hold when I call that budget. Budget 1. Finance Committee 2. Select Board 3. Town Manager 4. Human Resources 5. Information Technology 6. Comptroller 7. Treasurer Collector 8. Postage 9. Board of Assessors. Name and precinct.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Mr. Moderator. Steve Revelak precinct 1. Mr. Moderator I have a few questions that will probably well to direct towards the Director of Assessments or to the Board of Assessors. So the Assessors Office plays a very important role in town in that they are responsible for recording new growth. Now as a background Massachusetts has a law called proposition two and a half which limits the net tax levy increase to two and a half percent per year. So new growth generally comes from construction for example when someone replaces a building with a more valuable one and the new more valuable one generates more tax revenue. New growth is not subject to the limits of proposition two and a half. I mean this is important for a community like Arlington because our expenses often grow at more than two and a half percent each year and having enough new growth means that we can close the gap between two and a half percent and the actual increase in costs as opposed to having to do periodic overrides. So according to MassDUR's Division of Local Services Arlington's new growth rate was 0.95% for FY 2024. Mr. Moderator I'm wondering if that's typical for Arlington.</blockquote>

You might need to pull the microphone up it's yeah. Is that better? Yes thank you. And the question was our last year's growth rate is that typical for Arlington? For Arlington yeah. I would say yes it is. It's projecting trending upward but it would be typical for a town this size with this particular commercial size.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 112</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay yeah it's we were 270th out of 371 but I it seemed typical to be and I thank you for thank you for sharing that you agree. Now in terms of the breakdown of new growth about 86% of that came from was classified as residential and I was wondering if you can talk about how what kind of properties this comes from and how you go about capturing that new growth so that you know it's recorded fairly in the tax rolls. I'm sorry would you would you repeat the last part? How what's your process for you know sort sort of reassessing process properties and capturing the new growth?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 75</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure so we have several methods of capturing growth. Initially we receive all of the permits that are pulled in the Inspectional Services Department so anyone who would take out a permit to say put a deck on on a piece of property that would be recorded we would measure the deck we'd assess the the deck and the difference between their last year's assessment and the new assessment essentially the deck would be growth.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 29</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay thank you. Now the next biggest contributor to new growth was personal property this this was about 12 13 ish percent so what what exactly is personal property?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 43</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal property is anything that is not real estate not attached to a particular property and it the definition varies by the type of entity who's claiming this property and their tax status so there would be several different answers to that question.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 20</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay and our last contributor was a commercial growth which was about 1.2 percent anything remarkable there from your perspective?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Dana Mann - 21</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No I think those numbers line up precisely with the mix of commercial and residential property that we have in town.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 65</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a final question and this is where we get into budgets because you your department has to go around and visit all of these properties and you know periodically look at them the you know the physical plant and the stuff that you're using do you feel that your office has enough staffing and support to do the work that it needs to do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Mr. moderator Chris Loretti precinct 7. I have a question about the planning department and in particular responsibilities relating to the determination of when a special permit is needed which body grants that special permit in particular the Redevelopment Board and or the Zoning Board of Appeals and also who's responsible for the content of legal notices for hearings that the ARB holds and I'm curious about this because over the past year there was one case where a special permit was referred to the Redevelopment Board when it really should have been referred to the Zoning Board of Appeals there was another when it was referred to the Zoning to the Redevelopment Board and no special permit was needed and then there was the MBTA Communities Act where the Attorney General has deemed the legal notice for our last for the special permit hearing as defective and if you look at the the budget for the planning departments it's increased over the past five years the level of staffing has increased and in the certainly the budget itself has increased and I'm trying to figure out just who's responsible for within the planning department what position is responsible for these determinations as to what happens when a permit application comes in and also the the content in distribution of the legal notices for hearings both special permit hearings and the zoning bylaw change hearings at the Redevelopment Board's required to hold</blockquote>

John's Church or anywhere unpleasant Street and mystic or Mass Ave, after all roads, water, and sewer are the primary services of the town that nearly every resident uses on a daily basis.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director Rademacher, do you have an answer to that? How much it costs to paint the crosswalks? Michael Rademacher, Director of Public Works. We don't have a separate line item for the painting of crosswalks. The crosswalks are painted internally by staff except on occasions where a road is newly paved and we can put down thermoplastic, which you mentioned on older roads where there are already layers of existing paint. We can't apply that type of material. So we do look to improve the paint condition when we pave a road and then we look to maintain it on our older roads with our own staff. But I appreciate your comments and concerns and I know we are looking at ways to make improvements to crosswalks, especially on our busier roadways and finding ways to improve the visibility of the crosswalk is something we are looking to do.</blockquote>

I had originally risen and included a question about salt. I will not ask it now. I did want to ask a question and also provide a compliment to the Department of Public Works. For some years, I have been asking for Mill Street to receive a yellow stripe. Mill Street is much busier now with the process of the high school project getting closer to completion. And the stripe that the Department of Public Works has put down has dramatically, I think, decreased the chance of accidents there. I would also ask the Department of Works please to look at their own territory, Grove Street, which probably, and many others, but particularly Grove Street. Also a question that's a little bit of a criticism. Does the Department of Public Works have enough money in its budget for Pleasant Street and Jason Street and other heavily potholed roads? And could they please work on that? It's been very bad this year. I lost a tire, but it wasn't in Arlington, but I've noticed it in Arlington. So I wonder if the budget is adequate for pothole removal. Director Rademacher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, now the real thing I wanna talk about. I've been bothered for some time watching Feeney Brothers dig up fairly nice streets. You know, the town does a pretty decent job going through and repaving the streets, and then Feeney Brothers comes and digs them up because we do need to replace the gas lines. I'm not quibbling about that. And I've watched them, and they dig them up, and then they throw most of the dirt back into the hole, and they run it up and down with a plate compactor, and then they throw the rest of it in, compact it again, pave it, and go home. And then for a year, we have to drive over roads like the one, like the stretch of Mass Ave going from Grove Street up to Brattle Street. It's bumpy and humpy, and sometimes they have to come in and fill it in, because it's rough. Can we make Feeney Brothers actually compact the dirt they're putting back in properly, so that it doesn't settle so much and unevenly?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Rademacher - 120</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think we can look at that, right? We don't have the staff to monitor every project they're working on on a hour-by-hour basis. We do require that they backfill their trench appropriately and that they are patched, and we expect there's going to be settlement, and that's why we require them to do a temporary patch and come back a year later and mill that patch out and create a permanent patch that is wider than the trench that they created in order to make a more navigable and smooth surface. So it's inevitable you're going to get some settlement. We can have discussions with them to see if there's a way to get a better temporary product.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Ed Tremblay - 191</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they'd just have to backfill it properly, which is like every six inches and compact it, another six inches, compact it, instead of putting in two or three feet of dirt, running over that, and then another foot and be done. So they do, I don't think it's exactly as you're suggesting, but they probably can do a better job. They have plenty of projects in town. I've watched them. I've watched them as well, so we're watching two different projects. So the repaving, that's another problem because they only do half the street, but they're replacing gas lines that go to both sides of the street. So that means the other half of the street has a bunch of trenches that we have to go across, and even after they're done repaving, it's never flat, it's never smooth, it's either a dip or a pump, and it's perpendicular to the street, so it's like running over speed bumps, little speed bumps, they're not huge, but still, can we make them repave the whole street? And so the whole street comes out smooth the way it was before they started?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have, on occasion, when they disturb so much of the road that it makes more sense to pave the entire road, we have worked with them to do such. I don't believe that we can have them pave entire roads all the time. Because that trench that they leave on the half that they don't pave eventually turns into a pothole because it's a crack, the water gets into it. Ultimately, their entire work site is paved, the trench and the gas connections. I appreciate the fact that it does create a temporary washboard effect, and that even when it's final, it's never the same as original. We hold a higher standard when we have a newly paved road or a road that's been paved within five years, we hold them to a higher standard, but realistically, we can't ask for perfection on roads that aren't perfection to begin with. Well, yeah, I understand that, and some of the roads we're digging up are not, you know,</blockquote>

Intersections. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead, go ahead. I am running out of time. For years, the town has been reconfiguring intersections and tightening them up and making them squarer and removing wedges and curves and things that actually make it possible to drive a truck in town without running the curbs over. Do you have a CDL? I do not. Okay. Because the way the town has been reconfiguring curb intersections lately, I drive a Mel's Landall, and I either have to drive over the curbs, which I really don't want to do because the tires cost a lot, or I have to drive on the wrong side of the road to get through these intersections now, and it can be kind of dangerous because people aren't expecting me to do that, and either I have to wait and wait and wait, or in the case of coming out of Heard Road and onto Forest Street, for instance, people aren't necessarily looking up Forest Street all that much when they come out of Park Ave. Extension, so they pull up to the intersection quick, look down Forest Street, start up, and there I am on the wrong side of the street trying to get out without running the curbs over.</blockquote>

Yes, and it was determined at that time, based on the amount of trees that we lose over the course of a year for health reasons. About 500? Or, no, storm damage, which is about 150 trees. Okay. The planting of 300 in about 20 years or so would get us to that previous canopy. So that is the goal of our current planting program. There is, it is taken into account, the trees we lose to health, storm, or other reasons. And it strives to get a net increase of trees.</blockquote>

I'm not suggesting there is still a gas leak. There may have been one when we originally paved it over. We'd have to look. I know there was work done on Mass Ave. There's gas at Uncle Sam Plaza. I walk by it every day. So there's also a tree that fell over behind the Uncle Sam Monument that's behind John Leone's building, where his office is. So I'd just like to request an oak tree to replace it there. And we lost a tree pit on Russell Street when the curb was done. So I'd like that to come back. So we have an online request for tree requests, and you're more than welcome. For the tree? For trees, yes, correct. Tree pit request? Yes.

I wanted to, for one, I'm speaking of my street, Jason Street, the part between the Avenue and Irving Street, where I walk my dog every night, so I'm very familiar with that sidewalk. And there were 10 trip hazards along there, and I'm pleased that the public works have eliminated four of them. by taking out the bumps and paving them with fresh blacktop. And there are two of them that occurred when town trees were taken out, street trees were taken out, and the street trees had taken up part of the sidewalk, so there's just a hole there now. But the other thing that occurred in our street is the gas company, last fall and going into December, finally put in a new line and got rid of the gas leaks that we've been putting up with for decades, and that was a great benefit. But then they often had to tear up people's sidewalks and sometimes people's front yards, and then they slapped some blacktop on them. They don't do a good job like our men do when they put down some blacktop. They just slap it in any old way, and they don't compact it properly, so it's full of irregularities, you might say. In one case, a brick sidewalk, they took out the bricks and piled them at the side of the sidewalk and slapped on some blacktop, and this is months later. The bricks are still on the little wall beside the sidewalk, and the blacktop is gradually sinking into the ground. So I wondered, Mr. Wiremaker, if the public works or somebody could get after the gas company and get them to hire someone to do the paving work properly so that the sidewalks don't have these further difficulties for people walking.

So there is an increase that is certainly above the normal 3%, 4% growth rate for a school budget in order to compensate for adjusting salaries, and as salaries are about 85% of our budget, this is going to be a big increase here. And we did make the case for this within the context of the override that was passed by a 2-to-1 margin last November.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank you. I would note that as of now, Arlington is spending more per student than both Winchester and Belmont, slightly more, and then if you look at the in-district spending, there's even a greater divergence with Arlington spending more per student in district services. I guess the next question, though, is we're talking about 8.5% this year. Does anyone know what the percentages are going to be in the next few years?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Loreti - 162</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, well, I'll take a look there. I would note that the enrollment projections pretty much now are flat, and then in future years we'll be going down. The final question I have is, some of you here are old enough to remember former selectman Charlie Lyons, and he was around, if not at the beginning of the time that Arlington started doing property tax overrides, certainly at the time of some of the early ones. And I recall the commitment he made when he was chairing the board of selectmen that when they had an override, the total spending on the town side and the school side would be capped to particular amounts outside of growth in the health insurance budget. And I'm wondering, has that continued? Is there any cap in overall spending in those 2 budgets, town side and school side? And how does the current school, if there is, how the current school spending compares with those caps?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Paul Schlichtman - 98</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the caps are part of the fiscal stability plan every time we go out for an override. But there are exceptions within the plan that were built into it. So you need to take a look at our strategic plan that we brought to the Finance Committee, we brought to the town, we brought to the voters of the town and said, we're going to go and make this consistent increase under the stability plan, but we do need additional resources to do things like improve our teacher salary rate and improve our services for high-needs students.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what the cap was for the Education Department during this latest override? I'll let the Chair of the Budget Committee answer that. Dr. Allison Ampey?##### Kirsi Allison-Ampe</blockquote>

Kirsten Allison Ampey, Precinct 13 and School Committee member and Budget Chair. So the caps are found in the Long-Range Plan, as Mr. Schlickman was saying. They are 3.5% on the growth of the general education portion of the budget, 7% on the growth of the special education portion of the budget, and then a growth factor which either adds to or takes away from our budget depending on whether we have added students over the past year or decreased the students. As you say, we have been in... Before this, we were in a growth period where we were adding hundreds of students over the years. At this point, we're at a plateau. We have done one decrease. This year was an increase. We'll see where it goes. Thank you.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Loreti and Kirsi Allison-Ampe - 152</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it sounds like given the large increases, your subsequent increases should be much smaller to get back to that average. If it's 3.5%, did you say, outside of special education? It's 3.5% for general education, 7% for special education, and then a half per additional student. But there are additional students, and if the overall budget's increasing at 8.5%, then it has to be lower. Thank you. Those are not... The 8.5% was because we had an override. I'm asking about overall increase in spending growth. I don't care where the money comes from. This year, there was an increase of the total budget of an additional $3.1 million as part of the override plan. That was in addition to the 3.5% on general ed, 7% on special ed. Thank you, Ms. Monterey. So that 3.5% isn't really a real cap, is what she's saying. Thank you. I appreciate the answers.</blockquote>

Give me the line number you were on again. 3302. 3302. Oh, Pupil Services. Pupil Services. Do you know? So that was increased in FY24, so we would need to go back and look at why. That is a question that we are happy to answer, but we can't answer on the spot right now. Chances are there was a reallocation. We have also recoded recently because we have a new chart of accounts, and that shuffled expenses to new codes, and so that could be part of the reason as well. We would have to look into it. There was not a significant increase in students on 504 plans between FY23 and FY24. So even though it says 5,000 in 2023, and then it goes up to 16,000 in 2024? Am I reading that wrong? And that was from last budget year to this budget year, so we would need to go back at last budget year's build to understand where that came from. It didn't come from this budget year's build. And then it goes down again in 2025. Slightly, yes. I'm not sure. Okay. So we don't know. Okay. Thank you. I'm happy to find out for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>Capital Planning Budget</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christopher Moore - 968</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Mr. moderator. Christopher Moore precinct 14 and chair of the capital planning committee. I'm here to introduce our article 40 the capital budget. Next slide please. I will cover these five points hopefully very rapidly to make good use of your time. Next slide please. First of all thanks. Capital planning in Arlington is a team sport and I would like to thank everyone involved for their time, effort, consideration, and flexibility. This year was a particularly tight year and a lot of people had to get not quite what they wanted. The work starts here early each fall when town department heads come up with a list of all the capital purchases they think they need to deliver their programs for the next five years. After that the committee members shown here meet in small groups with the department heads to ask questions about those projects and really understand what's driving them. Over the following months the committee meets together to consider all the projects and balance the expenditures across the town. Special thanks are due to our deputy town manager for finance Alex McGee, town treasurer Julie Wayman, and vice chair of the committee Timur Kayyantar. They were deeply involved with production of the report and it wouldn't have happened without their numerous contributions. Next slide please. Now on to the report content. The first part of it is the vote. That's what we're really doing here tonight. That's detailed on pages 1 to 5. It includes the acquisitions, the stuff we're buying, as well as debt service. You'll find all this stuff in the bright orange cover book. So for your information about what's coming in future years, we also include the five-year plan. That includes the what we call the out years through fiscal year 2029. And in the appendices we show a comprehensive list of every single item, its cost, timing, and funding sources. Next slide please. So how much are we spending? In fiscal year 2025, the cost of items to be acquired in the capital budget is 16.1 million dollars. Those are documented in sections 2, 4, and 5 of the vote. The reason they're split up is they're paid for different ways. The different ways that we pay for things in the capital budget include cash, money that we collected from taxes, bonding, which is where we borrow money in the capital markets, and other, which is a catch-all that means grants, donations, and enterprise funds. If you start looking into the details, public works is by far the largest at 53%. And the big items there are roads, water and sewer rehabilitation work, sidewalks, accessibility projects, and something I'm sure we'll talk about later, trash and recycling toters. Schools and school IT are about a third, 32%. Big items in that budget this year are envelope repairs, front office reconfiguration, and a solar array at Bishop. Roof replacement and fire alarm upgrade at Hardy. Exterior door replacement and a new playground at Brackett. And a lobby renovation and office addition at Stratton. Facilities is 5%. Big items there are the Robbins Library entrance stair rebuild and the town hall roof and clock tower work. Recreation is 5%. The big item there is Parallel Park, which is being renovated. And everything else amounts to 6%, just under a million dollars. That includes non-school IT, community safety, planning, health and human services, libraries, purchasing, and the clerk's office. Some of these purchases will be made using cash. Some will be made, funded using bonds. That's important because when we vote to bond something, we're binding future town meetings to pay the bill, just as previous town meetings have bound this town meeting to pay for past purchases. Next slide, please. That brings me to debt service. How much we paying for all those bills that we, for things we bought in the past. This year debt service for the town is 20 million dollars. That's paid mostly by cash from the general tax. It covers principal and interest payments on prior year's bonds. That includes non-exempt debt at about 37% and exempt debt at 63%. So exempt debt is debt that's authorized by vote of the town over and above the capital plan. The biggest example is down the street on Mass Ave. Arlington High School. Non-exempt debt is the debt that's authorized within the capital plan and does not increase our taxes. Next slide, please. As a town, we've long limited our capital budget to 5% of the overall town budget, and we've also limited the five-year capital plan to 5% of the projected town budget for the five years. This allows for long-term planning and fiscal discipline. The table at the top of this slide is from page 13 of the report, and the green boxes show that the net non-exempt capital plan is 10.27 million, which works out to just under 5% of the town's total budget for FY25, and that the overall plan is just over 5.00% of the projected budget for five years. Since the size of the capital plan is capped, if something gets added, something gets taken away. That means that it either has to be removed, delayed, or reduced. Next slide, please. So this was the fast version of the capital budget. Please read the report. That's where all the details are, and we'd be glad to answer any of your questions here or later. I'd also like to say that we are expecting an opening on the committee, so if you're interested in joining in this work, applications will be accepted soon, as soon as the moderator posts it, probably after we're all done with this meeting. And we respectfully ask for your affirmative vote on Article 40. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, James McSweeney, and Precinct 16. Sorry, I'm coming up here a little bit on a whim, but I didn't quite realize I was going to have this opportunity. On January 11th of this year, we had a freak storm that flooded our basement with municipal sewage, as well as my next-door neighbor, and I hope this is within scope, but there was quite a flux of water that somehow ended up in the sewer system. We got somewhere between two and four inches of rain that night, and about 11 inches of snowmelt, and as we all, I think, are mostly aware, we are going to be seeing more of these freak storms, and I'm concerned that our infrastructure is not prepared for that in this town. How the sewage got into, how a mixture of stormwater and sewage got into our basement is sort of a mystery, because we have separate stormwater and sewage systems, from what I understand. I mean, aside from the disaster that this has been for our family, and you know, we have a finished basement, family members displaced for three months, and this is the second year in a row this has happened to our next-door neighbors. I'm sure that this has happened to multiple residences around town, and yeah, so I guess my question is, is our capital planning for infrastructure taking into account the freak occurrences that are being caused by catastrophic climate change?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Rademacher - 212</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Moore, do you have an answer, or Mr. Rademacher? Michael Rademacher, Director of Public Works. Thank you. So we do, we do make annual repairs to the sewer system. We have a pretty robust program, where we annually inspect a certain section of town, and then we will design improvements, and then make, make those necessary repairs, and the majority of that work is focused on keeping groundwater out of the sewer lines. When we have a wet season like we have had, groundwater levels rise, clean water finds its way into cracks and defects in the pipe, and takes away some of the capacity that was intended for sewerage, and the consequences, unfortunately, as you witnessed. So the hundred percent of our sewer capital, about a million dollars a year, goes to making these types of repairs. In addition to that, we are also embarking on a program to investigate and have sources of sump pump, clean water, people's basements, that potentially inadvertently or intentionally connected to the sewer, disconnected. It's a violation of plumbing code, and we are now looking at reducing that as well. So I agree, we have some work to do, and we are concentrating the majority of our funds on just the problem you identified.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 James McSweeney - 103</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's very good to hear. So is, I think it's safe to assume that these old pipes have a lot of cracks, and I've seen video of the water literally gushing in, clean water getting in there, and so therefore a big storm event can create this surge. It's hard to imagine how it created such a, so much pressure in the system, but I suppose that that is a possible answer. I guess my only follow-up question is, are the pipes getting any bigger, or are we assuming that simply getting rid of the cracks is going to create enough additional surplus?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Michael Rademacher - 141</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, the pipes don't need to get bigger, they need to be repaired and used only for the intent for which they were designed. So when we can, what we do is we find the most offending pipes, and we actually put a liner in them, and that seals up the cracks, and that'll prevent the groundwater from getting in. But where we need cooperation from homeowners and residences are the sources that come from private properties, some pumps, gutters, floor drains that back in the day it was acceptable to connect, or it may have been at one point acceptable, it is no longer, and we need to remove those because that's when you have a large storm event, and you have those direct connections is where you see the largest problem. So we really need to remove those sources.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 James McSweeney - 91</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, it seems like there might have been some actual direct connections, just given the volume, and so thank you, thank you for answering the questions. I just, obviously it's a personal issue for me, but it's also an issue because the town is ultimately liable for this type of sewer discharge into people's homes, so it does impact the overall budget of the town as well, and obviously everyone wants to be able to have functioning homes and not to deal with this stuff, so thank you all. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christopher Moore and John Leone - 166</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Moore. Okay, the million and a half dollars for trash toters is to have the town outfit every residence in the town with both a recycling and a solid waste receptacle that can be used with an automated collection system. And the reason to do that is to support the town's efforts for an affordable trash contract. Now, we don't know yet whether that will, in fact, be something we need to do in order to get an affordable trash contract. So we're putting ourselves in the position where that's an option. So if we get one, then we're going to get the toters? That's my understanding, is we would not actually buy the toters unless they're going to save us money. These are these big things on the big wheels with the metal bar? Yes. One per household for? I believe there would be two, one for trash and one for recycling. And what if I have more trash than fits in the toter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Jim Feeney, town manager. I don't think it's turned on. Is it on? Try again. It's on. It's got a green light. OK. Hello? Yes. I don't think it was on. You were right. Yeah. So if, in fact, we did move forward with trash toters, and again, we would only do that if it were advantageous for the town to move towards automation. It may not be the case. We're going to be bidding out this contract in a number of different ways to try to make it so that we can, frankly, afford it, but still provide the level of service that Arlington's residents are accustomed to. If, in fact, you needed more trash than would be provided by the toter, and again, toters come in different sizes, you would have the ability to get another toter or potentially overflow bags. So a number of different systems that could be implemented to account for that. I know some households have many people, and they won't fit everything into one. Correct.</blockquote>

It's the first time anybody's used that title with me, so thank you, Greg. Good evening, everyone. I'm Patricia Shepard, chief information officer, information technology. So currently, what we do to run meetings like this is we use Novus Agenda. Correct. To both collect and receive. Microphone. Folks are just asking for you to talk into the microphone. Oh, so sorry. Yeah. So right into it. There we go. Better? So currently, the tool that we are using, Novus Agenda, is going to be retired by the vendor, Granicus. So I've been working both with our public information officer, Joan Roman, and with our clerk, Julie Brazil, to look at what the evolution of that will be. We're calling it modernization of agendas in minutes, but we really have to look for a new platform to do all of this and also looking at it through the lens of how do we increase people's access, meaning the public, to be able to give comment, see the comments that are being shared, et cetera. There's a lot that could happen here. We're actually just demoing different tools now, knowing that the tool is slated to be retired in 12 to 18 months.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Hello, I'm Rachel Zember, Chair of the Arlington Redevelopment Board. And I'll be taking you through Warren Article 29, the Reduced Height Buffer for 2024 Annual Town Meeting. Next slide. Article 29 proposes to reduce the height buffer distances required when two different heights are specified for the same zoning district. In the Arlington Zoning Bylaw, height buffers are used to minimize shadows from taller buildings from falling on properties located in the R0, R1, R2, and open space districts. However, the height buffer distances in the current bylaw originally set in 1975, when taller buildings were allowed by the zoning bylaw, reflect building heights that are no longer allowable in several zoning districts. Given that the overall height maximums have been reduced, the required height buffer distances should likewise be reduced. And this article would reduce the applicable buffer distances by 50%. This article reduces the buffer distances to reflect the current allowable building heights and would add greater clarity as to the size of the minimum buffer. It also clarifies the language to reflect the ability of the redevelopment board to permit the upper level, excuse me, the upper limit if it finds that it could not, it would not be detrimental to adjacent properties in alignment with the safeguards included in the special permit criteria. Next slide. This drawing illustrates that without this change, many buildings are required to be much shorter than the height limit of their district. In fact, the current setbacks essentially prohibit a building from being constructed to the allowable heights that have been otherwise set, reviewed and approved by town meeting for our zoning bylaws. This discourages projects that might otherwise match the zoning bylaws intentions for those districts due to the small lot sizes that exist across our zoning districts. Next slide. The proposed amendment to the language includes, next slide, a reduction to the buffer distances to reflect the current allowable building heights and would add greater clarity as to the size of the minimum buffer. A note again that this article only refers to the buffer distances required when two different heights are specified for the same zoning district. The redevelopment board retains the authority to allow the higher height limit if they determine that it would not have detrimental impact based on environmental design review criteria and the special permit criteria in section 3.3 and 3.4. Next slide. The amendment makes the new buffer height area clear in table, in this table of section 5.3.19. The ARB voted 5 to 0 at our April 1st meeting to recommend favorable action on article 29. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Carl Wagner - 344</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Carl Wagner, precinct 15. Could we have the slide with the house, the car and the buildings up again, please? I think there was a car. The diagram? I'd like to point out that we are still awaiting all the changes that the MBTA density overlay is going to make and people are not even aware that those changes are going to go through. These changes are said in the text that precedes this slide that 1975 resulted in a big change in zoning and now we need to make changes because of 75. Well, that's like 50 years ago and we just had MBTA densities go through. I think we should probably admit that 50 years could be 52 or 53. I think we should probably not do this right now and I'd like to draw attention because it took me a long time to understand what the buffer areas are. The buffer areas are like a DMZ between North Korea and South Korea, between the larger, taller, more typically commercial areas with big office type buildings and then residences, apartments, single and two family units that are the house. They're proposing changes that could make two or more floors I think because you can have six floors in some of the businesses I think. They're proposing bringing those buildings closer essentially, losing the area that you see grayed out in the lower picture there. What it means is loss of sun exposure for solar panels because we don't have any protections for solar panels for the residences nearby. Loss of open space potentially or at least shading of open space and I ask myself, is this a good thing for Arlington right now? I hope others have other thoughts to mention on it. I would also point out that it might even be unnecessary to do this because I believe that the board has decision capability to go beyond what the law says when they want to for an appeal or for a developer who asks. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Holman and then Mr. Wharton. Aram Holman, precinct 6. I have some questions as well as some statements. I took a look at the code. I'm reading. Could you step maybe like a couple inches away from the speaker or from the microphone? That might help. Sorry about that. I'm reading here that a height buffer is defined as a lot or part of a lot which is located at a lesser distance from any land, not within a public way in an R0, R1, 2 or OS district. Then the following, I have a couple of questions. I've read this many, many times and in the absence of your diagram, I can't understand it. And so my first question is, should we have in our bylaws things which most people can understand? Second, also a question, it says the lower height shall apply and then it specifies different directions, northwest, northeast, easterly between northeast, southeast. Can you explain why the different height buffers apply in different directions? I'm really at a loss here. Mr. Revelak, would diagrams be something we could do in the zoning bylaw and why the directional, right?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 164</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I, there were diagrams at one point. I'm not, I guess maybe they were taken out. But anyway, I, you know, I understand Mr. Holland's point that why do we have things in the bylaw that are difficult for people to understand and I kind of take that. But really this one is about sun exposure. So we are in the northern hemisphere. So if you are, if, you know, the sun will cast a larger shadow on the northern side of the building than on the southern. And the ones on the east and west tend to be, you know, about balanced. So when the bylaw talks about a, you know, the current buffer distance of 100 feet between southwesterly and southeasterly, they're really talking about like the southern quadrant of a circle. Ditto for, you know, the parts between northwesterly and northeasterly. That's 200 feet, again, southern exposure puts a bigger shadow on the northern side of the building. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. I also took a look, I was looking for the definition of a height buffer and there is a section in the bylaw for definitions. There is no definition of height buffer within the section of the bylaw for definitions. The only definition is right here. I'm just wondering, why didn't anybody bother to put this in the definitions? It isn't there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Mark. Sure, it's Steve Revelock. There, in 2018, Arlington did recodify its zoning bylaw and we did make an effort to improve upon the definitions. But at this, this one just never came up, perhaps because there's an entire section that devotes, devoted to explaining it.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Aram Hollman - 146</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it wasn't there before and it isn't there now and yet people need to look for this. Ultimately, as you said, this is a debate over whether for smaller houses you can build additional floors beyond the third story. And the real issue is to what extent you're going to take people's sun. And I'm looking at this, and be it for solar panels or even without solar panels, I don't think we should be taking people's sun like that, particularly when you have buildings, houses, residences that have been there a long, long time. If these were houses which had just been built 20 years ago, that might be different. But you are changing a fundamental status quo here. And I don't think most people want their sun and their light taken away. And I respectfully urge you to vote against this. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. We'll take Mr. Wharton and then Mr. Newton. So it sounds like if the earth gets knocked off axis, we might have to correct those directions in the zoning bylaw, is that right?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Worden - 320</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Is this working? Yes. Okay. John Wharton, Precinct 8. When the zoning bylaw was, when the buffer was put in back in 1975, the recodification, nobody had ever heard of solar panels. But time has moved on and solar panels are proliferating very much so. And I had, two of my sons were in business related to solar panels. So I know a little bit more about it than I used to, anyway. But the point is that we're talking about sustainability and environment and all this sort of thing and not burning fossil fuels to make electricity. So solar panels are giving a lot of people a lot of independence from the fossil fuel that otherwise we use to turn on all the lights we have here and so on. So it becomes much more important, perhaps, to not block the sunlight from anybody's house. Because it exists now, or as it may exist later, and they build a new house on the same lot or something like that. And so it seems to me the fact that buildings may get taller, or buildings used to be taller, we have a lot of buildings that are taller than our present five feet, five feet, I wish, five stories, that was kind of the maximum in the 1978 and 79 reforms to the height limits. So I want to just particularly be sure that anything that changes that buffer area is carefully calculated to not, in any possible way, cast a shadow or block the sunlight from anybody's solar panels. And I don't see how you can do that when we don't even know how high buildings are going to be. And so I would respectfully suggest that we keep the buffers the way they are. Don't pass this proposed change. I mean, it's worked for 50 years. Let's give it another 50 years. Thank you.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 99</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. So although MBTA communities does not have the criteria of, it doesn't meet the criteria of having a height dimension with two limits. But there is a section in there that says that the sixth story is subject to the height buffers. So in the case of six stories, under our MBTA community zoning would be Mass Ave. And that would be someone building a mixed-use building and trying to take advantage of a two-story bonus for either doing commercial or doing very sustainable development or doing extra affordable housing. But it would apply to the sixth story.</blockquote>

And one of the things that applicants before the redevelopment board typically say is that they're really interested in building residential. And this applies to the upper heights, which are that's where your residential would go. So yeah, this would hopefully encourage more mixed-use development and allow more residential units. Great. Thank you very much. I hope you will vote in support of this amendment. And thank you. Great. We'll take Pi Fisher and then Mr. Lewicki.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Elizabeth Carr-Jones, Precinct 14, and this is Susan Stamps, Precinct 3. We're here representing Green Streets Arlington, a group of volunteers from the Tree Committee, Open Space Committee, Conservation Commission, and Finance Committee. We came together during the MBTA communities process to advocate for measures to mitigate climate change and enrich Arlington's natural environment. And we worked with the ARB to craft their recommended vote on this article. Next slide, please. As a community, we recognize the benefits of a more livable environment, green shady streets, great quality of life, and welcoming local businesses. We also recognize the importance of climate change, climate change resilience, and seek ways to reduce excess heat and flooding and improve our air quality. In 2010, Arlington was designated one of the first green communities in Massachusetts. Sustainability has been woven into our town's fabric for a long time. Next slide, please. Now, let me stress the urgency of now. Global temperatures are rising, as shown in this graph, from 1880 to 2020. And this heat map of Arlington from Mystic River Watershed Association's Wicked Hot Mystic Project shows a pattern of higher temperatures shown in red in areas with more pavement and fewer trees, and the lowest temperatures in our few areas of forest. Next slide, please. Using Google Maps, we counted roughly 70 parking lots in Arlington with more than 25 spaces. They serve our larger businesses, residential buildings, schools, and town centers. Here are a few examples. Top left is CVS beside the high school. Top right is Stop and Shop. Bottom left is Russell Common in the center. And the bottom right is the Thompson School, which at 26 spaces is the smallest parking lot this amendment would have applied to. Now, Susan will walk you through the details. Next slide, please. Thank you, Elizabeth. Susan Stamps, Precinct 3. Can you hear me okay? I'll try to keep my voice up. We're proposing an amendment to zoning section 6.1.11D6 to require shade in parking lots with more than 25 spaces, not small parking lots, but big ones, over 25 spaces, including parking lots that are expanded to more than 25 spaces. Section 6.1.D6 already requires landscaped areas in at least 8% of the total paved portion of parking lots over 25 spaces. But normally, as I'm sure you've noticed, that landscaping is bushes and other low plantings that don't provide shade. However, another section of our zoning bylaw that I didn't know about requires heat mitigation in the industrial district, including shading with trees or solar panels as an option. Building on the work that has already been done on greening our industrial parking, our amendment extends these shading concepts to the residential and business districts. Next slide, please. Our proposed amendments to 6.1.11D6 add the requirement that shade must be provided in those large parking lots by trees and or solar panels. If trees are used, there must be one tree planted for every 8 parking spaces with some part of every parking space no more than 32 feet from a tree. If you graph this out in a parking lot, you'll see that when the tree gets a big canopy at maturity, it's going to be covering probably about 50% of the area that the tree is in. The other option that can be done separately or combined with trees are solar canopies over parking spaces to cover at least 50% of the area where they're located in the parking lot. In addition, the amendment includes this language developed with the tree warden to ensure that contractors choose appropriate shade trees and take care of them, including watering for the first three years. My favorite part as a member of the tree committee. Let's see how this might work in the Whole Foods parking lot. Next slide, please. On the left is an aerial view of what we have with our current zoning, 81 parking spaces, no shade trees, and no solar panels. On the right is a simulation of what we could have had with this bylaw amendment had it been in place when that parking lot was put in. Here we've used a 50-50 combination of trees and solar canopy to get over, to get 80 parking spaces, only one less than we started with, but with the addition of five shade trees and 192 solar panels. Few, if any, parking spaces would be lost with this amendment because the already required 8% landscape area creates a lot of room for trees, and solar canopies are typically built to fit neatly over the rows with minimal footprint. Next slide, please. There are so far just a few cities and towns across the country, we found, that require shade in parking lots, but you can be sure they'll be increasing. One of those is Los Angeles, and another one is our neighboring town of Lexington, which uses a formula similar to the one in this bylaw. We hope that Arlington Town Meeting will continue its tradition of voting for Arlington being a leader in climate resilience and sustainability. Trees and solar panels both provide huge environmental benefits. Our parking lots are heat islands now. They will only get hotter. This amendment provides an easy method endorsed by a majority of the redevelopment board to make our town greener, cooler, and more livable. Please vote yes on Article 30. Thank you, and we're glad to take your questions. And Ms. Stamps, do you have an amendment to offer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a copy of this amendment on the back table, hopefully, or you've got it in your annotated warrant, but it's just two changes. They're just language changes. There's no substantive change. The first is at the end of paragraph D6. before subparagraphs A and B, replace the words for shading requirements in industrial districts C6.1.11F with the words for shading requirements in industrial districts C6.1.11.F semicolon, the below subparagraphs A and B are applicable to parking lots in the residential and business districts. And then the second amendment would be in D6, let's see, subparagraph B to delete the last sentence, this provision is applicable to parking lots in the residential and business districts. So in short, it's just to clarify, it's applying the provision to that, to paragraph D6 rather than just one of the sub items B. Yeah, it's kind of, it sort of creates an ambiguity the way it's written now and this clarifies it. And so can you move your amendment in 30 seconds? So I'd like to move that, that the meeting vote for this amendment that I just explained. To put the, put the amendment before the meeting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Carr-Jones, precinct 14. As we understand it, this would only apply to new parking lots that are 25 spaces or more or parking lots that have been expanded to 25 spaces or more. I don't know if it applies to any other parking lots. Okay, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Newton. Sanjay Newton, precinct 10. Could you bring up in the presentation, there was a slide early on that showed several parking lots, I think it was maybe slide four or five, I didn't count exactly. While they're finding that, I had a question for the ARB on whether they have a thought about the amendment we're being offered. Ms. Zember?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, perhaps the chair might have an opinion on her own or, that's fine, I'll leave it at that. Okay, we have these pictures. So, what do we see in these pictures? All these parking lots have many, many, many empty spaces. So, I would, a shaded parking lot is fine, but from a climate standpoint, from a heat island standpoint, not having a parking lot that large would be much, much, much, much better. So, I will, this is the amendment we have before us, so I will reluctantly vote for it, but I would ask you to think very hard in the future when we have opportunities to reduce our parking requirements. That would be ten times better than what we're doing here today. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Let's see, let's skip down to Mr. Hopp and then Mr. Cook. Mr. Cook, and then we'll go back to the top, Mr. Jameson. Grant Cook, Precinct 16. I guess a question for Ms. Stamps. If you could put the Whole Foods lot back up. I guess the question is, have you watched them pull a truck into that lot? I have, and it involves cones and cutting sections off, bringing it, I think it would take out the solar panels as it comes around. It's, just have you considered that, because it's, maybe they can plan around it, but there's other factors than my little Ford Fusion in parking lots.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Carjones, Precinct 14. Obviously, this is one of only, of many possibilities for the way this, the way this could have been applied to a parking lot. One of the things that this parking lot had going for it, in terms of us using it as an example, is it's relatively simple and, and, and, well, compared to Stop and Shop or some of the other ones, it's relatively simple and, you know, it's, it's easy to visualize where, where the trees would go, and if it had been designed with this in mind, I think it would have been much, much clearer how to deal with things like that. In other words, right now, the, the solar panels are right over the paved, paved center section, so I don't know if trucks actually drive over that, but yeah. Yeah, designing with this in mind would probably get a better result than what we have here. Okay, thank you.</blockquote>

So, this is only for future projects, as I heard. What happens if somebody repaves their parking lot and then relines it in a different fashion? Ms. Stamps.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Susan Stamps - 35</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not apply to repaving or any kind of reconstruction. Other than new parking lots, it only applies when you have an existing parking lot and you expand it to more than 25 spaces.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Susan Stamps - 44</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, that wouldn't apply because this only of this section of the zoning bylaw only applies to parking lots over 25 spaces. So, if they're, if they're 75 and they're in 750, it doesn't make them do that. Mr. Cunningham may have an answer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Michael Cunningham, Town Council. I think the proponents have accurately stated that this will not apply to new construction. It would not apply to, in my view, the language. It would not apply if there were a parking lot that reduced its size from 75 to 60. It would not apply to parking lots that, you know, anything that's existing now. This would be new parking lots.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Gordon Jamieson - 72</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so is, so my further question is, so let's take the Walgreens in East Arlington. Is this going to, that they have a huge lot and they might want to sell part of it and build a storefront in the front of that. Is this going to preclude them from doing that or can they do that and they still don't have to put up any shade trees or solar panels?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 61</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be, obviously these determinations are very fact-specific. If they were a new owner, arguably that would, the provisions would apply. If it's an existing owner who's just remodeling and reducing their lot size from a figure over the 25 amount to, you know, if they're already at 50 and they reduce it to 40, this would not be applicable.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Gordon Jamieson - 20</summary>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I believe there's Ms. Garber next and then we'll take Ms. Koepka. Judith Garber, Precinct 4. So in the report it said that some members of the Redevelopment Board were concerned or said that in the past they've been able to just figure things out with the developer instead of changing the whole law. But my question is, if this were to pass, would the Redevelopment Board be able to then work with developers if there's an irregular lot size or something to get some kind of solution passed that would work for them? Ms. Zember.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 79</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rachel Zember, Chair of the Redevelopment Board. I think those Redevelopment Board members who did not vote in favor of this were concerned that it would be more restrictive and that it would be challenging. It would, it would, it would present more challenges to come up with a creative solution for those areas where the regular lot sizes, where perhaps there might be other solutions such as rain gardens, etc., where perhaps large shade trees were not appropriate.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Judith Garber - 40</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so do you think in your opinion this would make it more difficult for a development to happen because someone might be concerned that they won't be able to plant all the shade trees that they would have to?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 123</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's, it's another challenging requirement. Parking lots are tight and our, our developers when they look at developing a parcel in Arlington, they work with the Redevelopment Board to reduce the size of those parking lots as much as possible and we appreciate that within the requirements that we have. Adding another requirement that again takes, that adds one more requirement that's very prescriptive is another way that, that, that space keeps getting cut up in more, more and more prescriptive areas rather than looking to find a creative solution that might be 7% of, you know, the land. So it's, it's, it's again, it's one more requirement on that very small open space that we have available to the developers.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Joanna Asia Kepka - 343</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. Ms. Kepka and then Ms. Carlton-Geeson. Asha Kepka, Precinct 1. I think this is a wonderful idea and I know a lot of the developers here are sort of standard, let's cut all the trees, let's build, maximize the buildings. I see this parking lot with the solar panels and I'm thinking this is a great revenue source. So a creative developer will create a parking lot where they can draw money from having solar panels. Everybody who's, let's say, visiting this mixed-use, let's say, complex would love to park under this shade. I could see a market, Sunday market, being utilized in this empty parking lot. We do have empty parking lot, right, of Route 60 that could be turned into art market, could be a place for people to perform. Here you could have a roof that draws from the sun, creates the revenue, could be a beer market, could be art market, it could benefit the town. It could be a great place for people to hang out. We don't have many shady areas where people can just lounge and listen to music. I am a little jaded because I do realize our redevelopment board, basically, even if we create this amendment, would be very lenient towards the developers who can come in and say this is unfeasible or too expensive. And I know they've been given a great leeway to the builders. There's a complex, mixed-use complex or apartment building next to Stop and Shop where the builder committed to one single tree. And that tree is gone three years or four years after the building was constructed. The one single tree that the builder committed is gone. And I don't think there is an enforcement to keep the builders to the word. So I think if we consider ourselves sustainable, we should choose things that are right, not just because they're slightly difficult or inconvenient doesn't mean they are not right. And I highly support this amendment. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Alan Jones, Precinct 14. I was part of this team to do that. I am on the Finance Committee, but this has nothing to do with the Finance Committee. I just wanted to really reiterate what you might have missed that Susan said about what space this takes. Now, because it's for new or effectively new parking lots, you're always starting with a blank slate. You're seeing a blank piece of paper. We've talked to developers and landscape designers, and they sort of said, it's not a problem. You know, nickels and dimes. And if you go through the geometry, if you draw what eight spaces in the aisle and the sidewalks and stuff take, it's I think 2240 square feet if you just do a simple calculation. And a six-foot diameter tree pit that covers that space, one for every eight spaces, is like 28 square feet. The bottom line is you can easily cover, if you're doing all trees with, you know, 30-foot shade trees, it takes one to two percent of the landscape space out of the eight percent that's already required. So there's a lot of flexibility in there to fit it into a brand new parking lot. And then, and I guess the only other thing I wanted to say is this isn't just tree hugger stuff. It actually makes better parking lots for us who use the parking lots. And I just ask you, when you go into a parking lot on a hot day, you're driving in, what do you look for? You look for a tree to park under. You know, it's a better, more comfortable parking lot. Should be better for business and residences and raise the rents and whatever, but it's a better parking lot for us who use them. So I hope you vote for it. Thank you.</blockquote>

All those opposed, say no. Debate is terminated. So let's take a vote now on the stamps amendment, which would apply that provision to two items instead of just the one, as the recommended vote of the ARB does. So let's switch over to a vote on the stamps amendment, which is the amendment itself is a majority vote. Okay. If you're in favor of the stamps amendment, press one for yes. If you're opposed to the stamps amendment, press two for no, or three to abstain. Okay. Let's close voting. And the amendment passes, 185 in the affirmative, 12 in the negative, and five abstentions. That takes us to the main motion, which is a two-thirds vote. And so we're voting on the main motion, as amended by the stamps amendment, which would amend section 6111D of the zoning bylaw to require that shade trees or overhead solar panels be provided in parking lots with more than 25 spaces, as amended by the stamps amendment. So voting is now open. If you're in favor of the main motion under Article 30, as amended by the stamps amendment, press one for yes. If you're opposed, press two for no, or three to abstain. This is a two-thirds vote. Okay. Voting is closed. And the motion passes, 184 in the affirmative, 18 in the negative, one abstention, which takes us to Article 31. Okay. We have a motion to adjourn.
