3. The Evans Amendment, proposed by Ms. Evans, seeks to reduce the size of the overlay district to exclude certain areas.

4. The Fleming Amendment, proposed by Mr. Fleming, proposes to remove the provision that allows for an additional story in buildings that meet certain sustainability standards.

5. The Kristen Amended Amendment, proposed by Ms. Kristen, suggests voting against all other amendments except for her own, which is not specified.

10. The Goldsmith Amendment, proposed by Mr. Goldsmith, supports the main motion and opposes all amendments.
</details><details><summary>List each speaker after the amendments were made, summarize what they had to say and indicate whether they support or oppose the amendments and the main motion.</summary>

> The speakers included Frank Siano, who questioned why a simple notice wasn't sent to homeowners about the potential impact of the zoning changes. Claire Ricker, Director of Planning and Community Development, and Michael Cunningham, acting town council, explained that the legal notice sent was required by law and intended to avoid interpretation. Siano expressed support for all amendments except the Bagnall and Fleming amendments.

Ezra Fischer spoke about the importance of understanding the implications of the zoning changes and making decisions based on values. He did not explicitly state his stance on the amendments or the main motion.

John Leone proposed an amendment to include his family's property in the overlay district for the neighborhoods. He did not explicitly state his stance on the other amendments or the main motion.

David Levy spoke in favor of the main motion and against the Bagnall amendment, arguing that more housing needs to be built in Arlington to accommodate families and workers.

Gary Goldsmith spoke in favor of the main motion and against all amendments except the Kristen amendment. He argued that the changes proposed in Article 12 would occur over a long period and would likely result in fewer units than currently discussed.

Nancy Bloom asked questions about how the affordable housing aspect of the proposal fits together, but did not explicitly state her stance on the amendments or the main motion. 

John Leone proposed an amendment to include his family's property in the overlay district for the neighborhoods. He did not explicitly state his stance on the other amendments or the main motion.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Loretti amendments.</summary>

> The Loretti amendments to Article 12 propose changes to the open space requirements and the inclusion of affordable housing units. The first amendment proposes that a minimum of 30% of the lot area in the overlay district be set aside as open space. The second amendment proposes that at least 15% of the total number of units in a multi-family housing project be affordable. The third amendment proposes that the affordable housing units be distributed throughout the project and be comparable in size and quality to the market rate units. The fourth amendment proposes that the affordable housing units be permanently affordable. The fifth amendment proposes that the developer provide a financial contribution to the town's Affordable Housing Trust Fund if the number of units in the project is not a multiple of 10.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Babiarz amendment.</summary>

> The Babi Yar's amendment was discussed during the meeting, but the specific details of the amendment were not provided in the provided context. It was mentioned that the amendment could potentially be thrown out by the attorney general or EOHLC, and it was suggested that the town could avoid taking a chance on this by stating they will not reach a certain number in the next 10 or 20 years. The speaker urged others to vote against the Babi Yar's amendment, but did not provide specific reasons or details about what the amendment entails.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Worden amendments.</summary>

> The Worden amendments, proposed by John Worden, primarily focus on the setbacks and density of the proposed zoning changes in Article 12. The first amendment suggests that the front yard setback should be at least 20 feet from the front lot line, and the side yard setback should be at least 10 feet from the side lot line. The second amendment proposes that the rear yard setback should be at least 20 feet from the rear lot line. The third amendment suggests that the density of the proposed zoning changes should not exceed one dwelling unit for each 2,500 square feet of lot area. These amendments aim to maintain the character of the neighborhoods and prevent overcrowding.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Bagnell/Fleming amendment.</summary>

> The Bagnell/Fleming amendment proposed to Article 12 of the town meeting seeks to increase the building height in the neighborhood multifamily districts from three stories to four stories. The proponents argue that this change would not significantly impact the fire department's ability to manage fires, as the cost and effort to put out a fire in a four-story building would be similar to that of a three-story building. They also believe that the amendment would incentivize developers to build larger buildings, potentially leading to an increase in housing units. However, opponents of the amendment argue that four-story buildings could overwhelm surrounding properties and may not align with the aesthetic of the neighborhood. They also express concern that if the state denies the town's application to require its own inclusionary zoning, developers could build nine-unit structures with no affordable units, which could lead to a decrease in relatively affordable units.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Anderson amendment.</summary>

> The Anderson amendment to Article 12 proposes to incentivize developers to include commercial use on the second floor of mixed-use buildings. The amendment requires 60% commercial use on the ground floor and makes it optional for developers to include 40% commercial use on the second floor. The goal of the amendment is to increase the amount of commercial space in these buildings, resulting in larger commercial spaces, without disincentivizing development. The amendment suggests that multi-level commercial use could result in interesting, creative, and captivating two-story configurations for various types of businesses.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Evans amendment.</summary>

> The Evans amendment to Article 12 proposed by Winnell Evans, a representative from Precinct 14, aims to restore the intended function of the neighborhood multifamily districts as buffers between the neighborhoods and the newly allowed heights along Mass Ave. The amendment focuses on the Arlington Heights District for two reasons: the East Arlington Neighborhood Multifamily District has already been reduced to the minimum depth possible to retain required contiguity, and Arlington Heights has the steepest grades where taller multifamily structures will impose on existing neighborhoods most significantly. The amendment combines the Arlington Heights and Pierce Forest Neighborhood Multifamily Districts to retain required contiguity and acreage requirements. The amendment also proposes to limit the spread of these districts to the flatter areas closer to Mass Ave. to minimize the effect of taller buildings on steeper streets. The amendment removes a net 90 parcels from the neighborhood multifamily district, which exists in a combined total of 350 units.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Lane amendment.</summary>

> The Lane amendment, proposed by Town Meeting member John Lane, suggests that any new construction or substantial reconstruction in the Neighborhood Multifamily (NMF) district should be set back at least 15 feet from the front lot line. This is to ensure that the new buildings do not encroach too closely to the street, maintaining a certain aesthetic and sense of space in the neighborhood. The amendment aims to balance the need for increased housing with preserving the character of the neighborhood.
</details><details><summary>Please, give a detailed explanation of the Leone amendment.</summary>

> The Leone amendment, proposed by John Leone, seeks to include his family's property at 5-7 Winter Street in the overlay district for neighborhoods. The property, owned by the A&E Realty Trust, is currently excluded from the overlay district. Leone argues that this exclusion could potentially prevent future development opportunities, particularly if neighboring properties wish to expand and need to purchase part of their back lot. The amendment aims to preserve their rights to do something with the property in the future.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize what Ezra Fischer had to say.</summary>

> Ezra Fischer, Precinct 4, spoke in favor of the proposed zoning changes, arguing that they would help address the housing crisis by allowing for more housing. He emphasized that while he is not a professional town planner, he tries to understand enough of a topic to see how it aligns with his values. He also expressed his discomfort with the phrase "the character of the town," which he feels has been used historically to exclude certain groups of people. He urged his fellow town meeting members to vote based on values such as optimism, courage, and inclusivity.
