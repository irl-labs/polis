<details><summary>Please, summarize the Special Town Meeting.</summary>

> The Special Town Meeting in Arlington in 2023 was called to order by the Town Moderator. The meeting discussed Article 12, the MBTA Communities Overlay District, which was scheduled to be taken up no sooner than October 23rd. The Town Moderator explained the process of managing two speaker queues during the debate on the article. The meeting also recognized the ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East and observed a moment of silence for the victims. The Town Clerk swore in new members and a vote was taken to consent to the use of a satellite room for the meeting. The meeting also conducted a test vote to ensure the functionality of the voting handsets. The meeting then received reports from the Finance Committee, the Redevelopment Board, and the Select Board. A typographical error was discovered on the ballot language for Question 1 on November 7th, which resulted in a tax increase taking effect next July instead of in February and spring of next year. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn until Thursday, October 19th.

</details><details><summary>List each speaker, and relevant article, who moved the question to terminate debate.</summary>

> The speakers who moved the question to terminate debate were Christopher Moore for Article 7 and Mark Kepline for Article 2.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize in separate paragraphs what Christine Deschler, Eric Helmuth, Jim Feeney and Mark Kepline reported on Article 2.</summary>

> Christine Deschler, Chair of the Arlington Finance Committee, reported that due to the language of the override ballot, the appropriation being sought in Article 2 cannot be achieved through funding through the override. The ballot as written is not effective until FY25, and Article 2 sought additional funding for the schools for FY24. Therefore, the Finance Committee recommended a no-action vote on Article 2.

Eric Helmuth, Chair of the Select Board, explained that a typographical error was discovered on the ballot language for Question 1 on November 7th. Instead of specifying July 1st, 2023, to identify the fiscal year in which the override would take effect, it said 2024. After consulting with the town manager and his finance team, they decided to proceed with the current language as they could still meet all the Select Board commitments for the override.

Jim Feeney, town manager, added that they were able to update their financial plan based on the most recent information available and determined that they would be in a position to meet the stated commitments for fiscal years 24 through 26 within the confines of an override that did not take effect until next year. He mentioned that the town's free cash position was particularly strong due to a milder winter and other favorable economic circumstances.

Mark Kepline, a town meeting member, expressed concern about the lack of public input on the changes proposed in Articles 5 through 11. He argued that the public should have had the opportunity to attend meetings and ask questions about the changes, especially since they could affect massive buildings and their abutters. He urged the meeting to vote no on these articles.
</details><details><summary>What was the final vote of no action for Article 2?</summary>

> The final vote for no action on Article 2 was unanimous.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Claire Ricker's outline for the zoning articles before the meeting.</summary>

> Claire Ricker, the Director of Planning and Community Development for the Town of Arlington, outlined several zoning warrant articles for the meeting. These included Articles 5 through 9 and 11, which aim to encourage redevelopment in the business districts to meet Arlington's economic development and sustainability goals. Article 10 pertains to the expansion of the town street policy. Article 3 is an administrative correction to the zoning bylaw. The proposed amendments were inspired by the 2022 town meeting changes to the floor area ratio to encourage the redevelopment of underutilized properties in the business districts. The amendments address challenges to creating more needed and desired quality commercial business space in the few areas of town that are zoned for business development.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article 3 and provide the final vote.</summary>

> Article 3 was an administrative correction to the zoning bylaw. The Arlington Redevelopment Board discussed a number of amendments to encourage commercial development and attract new commercial uses to the business districts B1 through B5, while supporting additional town goals for sustainability, urban design, and overall site standards. The final vote was unanimous in favor of no action, as there was nothing to do under this article due to the year.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article 4 and provide the final vote.</summary>

> Article 4 was a zoning bylaw amendment regarding step back requirements in business districts. The amendment proposed changes to three sections of the zoning bylaw. The first change updated the definition of building step back in Section 2 of the Zoning Bylaw. The second change made multiple edits to Section 5.3.17, titled Upper Story Building Step Backs. The third change removed Section 5.3.21, item C, which is about upper-story setbacks. The final vote on the amendment was 173 in favor and 37 against, making it a two-thirds vote and the motion carried.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article 5 and provide the final vote.</summary>

> Article 5 proposed a zoning bylaw amendment related to open space requirements in the business districts. The aim was to encourage the redevelopment of underutilized properties in the business districts and create more needed and desired commercial space. The amendment proposed changes to the definitions of open space, removed a section related to mixed uses, added an exception for business districts, and changed the open space requirements in the table of dimensional and density regulations. The final vote was 167 in favor and 53 against, achieving the required two-thirds majority, so the motion carried.

</details><details><summary>Summarize Jordan Weinstein's amendment for Article 5.</summary>

> Jordan Weinstein's amendment for Article 5 proposed to retain the existing definitions of "open space" and "usable open space" in Section 2 of the Zoning Bylaw. The amendment aimed to ensure that the definitions of these terms remained unchanged, while the other changes proposed by the main motion from the Arlington Redevelopment Board (ARB) would still be implemented.
</details><details><summary>List each speaker on Article 5, summarize what they had to say and indicate whether they support or oppose the Weinstein amendment.</summary>

> 1. Jordan Weinstein: Introduced the amendment to Article 5, arguing that it would preserve the requirement for ground-level open space in mixed-use developments. He expressed concern that the original article would allow developers to place open space on higher levels, potentially reducing accessibility and enjoyment for the public. He supports his amendment.

2. Beth Malofchuk: Supported Weinstein's amendment, emphasizing the importance of ground-level green space for public benefit. She cited the Brigham's residential building on the bike trail as a positive example of ground-level open space. She supports the amendment.

3. David Pretzer: Opposed Weinstein's amendment, arguing that rooftop spaces may be the best place for open space in many business district parcels. He suggested that the amendment could limit housing in mixed-use buildings and advocated for allowing rooftop gardens in general. He opposes the amendment.

4. Daniel Jalkut: Asked for clarification on whether the changes proposed in the original article would allow current properties with ground-level open space to rebuild without that open space. After receiving clarification, he did not explicitly state his position on the amendment.

5. Eugene Benson: Clarified that the original article would allow developers to move some open space to balconies and rooftops, but some ground-level open space would still be required. He did not explicitly state his position on the amendment.

6. Sanjay Newton: Opposed Weinstein's amendment, arguing that it would limit housing in mixed-use buildings by requiring open space to be on the first level. He supports the original article, which would allow open space on higher levels. He opposes the amendment.

7. Christopher Moore: Did not comment on the amendment specifically, but moved to terminate debate on all matters before it. His position on the amendment is unclear.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article 6 and provide the final vote.</summary>

> Article 6 proposed a simplification to the rear yard setback requirements in business districts. The changes proposed under Article 6 would establish a fixed set of rear yard setbacks in the business districts based on the height of the building and the surrounding context. The motion carried with 173 votes in the affirmative and 37 in the negative.
</details><details><summary>Please, list a summary for each slide presented by Steve Relivak for Article 6.</summary>

> Slide 1: Introduction to Article 6, explaining it as a proposed Zoning Bylaw amendment related to step backs in the business districts. 

Slide 2: Definition of a step back, explaining it as when the upper stories of a building come in a few feet away from the street, making the building seem less big and creating a built-in requirement for some variation in the facade.

Slide 3: Current step back requirements in Arlington, stating that starting at the fourth story, the building has to step back seven and a half feet on each side of the building with street frontage.

Slide 4: Proposed changes to the step back requirement, suggesting it only applies on the primary facade and clarifying that the step back is to be measured from the property line.

Slide 5: Comparison of step back requirements in other communities, showing that most don't have them and those that do generally require step backs well above the fourth story.

Slide 6: Conclusion, stating that the amendment addresses a challenge in redeveloping the upper stories of mixed-use buildings, particularly on smaller corner lots. The ARB voted 3 to 1 at their October 2nd meeting to recommend favorable action on Article 6.
</details><details><summary>Summarize David Pretzer's amendment for Article 6.</summary>

> David Pretzer's amendment for Article 6 proposed to change the rear yard setback requirements in business districts. The amendment aimed to establish a fixed set of rear yard setbacks based on the height of the building and the surrounding context. The proposed setbacks included zero feet when the building abuts an alley or right-of-way at least 10 feet wide, 10 feet when the rear yard abuts a non-residential district, 20 feet when three stories or less abuts a residential district, and 30 feet when four stories or more abuts a residential district.
</details><details><summary>Summarize Chris Loretti's amendment for Article 6.</summary>

> Chris Loretti's amendment for Article 6 proposed to modify the situation where there is a zero yard setback to remove lots where the rear of which abuts a right of way of 10 feet or less. His amendment aimed to protect the bike path and avoid a potential conflict in the zoning bylaw where there is a street wide right of way behind the property. He argued that this would ensure that developers could not claim a zero foot setback because they are abutting a right of way.
</details><details><summary>List each speaker on Article 6, summarize what they had to say and indicate whether they support or oppose the Pretzer and Loretti amendments.</summary>

> 1. Chris Loretti: He proposed the Loretti amendment, which would strike the clause "or rear right-of-way of at least 10 feet of width" from the main motion. He argued that this change would protect the Minuteman bikeway and avoid potential conflicts in the zoning bylaw. He supports his own amendment and opposes the Pretzer amendment.

2. Asha Kepka: She opposed the main motion, arguing that setbacks are necessary for greenery, open space, and fire safety. She did not explicitly mention the Pretzer or Loretti amendments.

3. Mark Kepline: He also opposed the main motion, citing concerns about fire safety and the need for more space for dumpsters and delivery drivers in rear right-of-ways. He did not explicitly mention the Pretzer or Loretti amendments.

4. Jordan Weinstein: He spoke in favor of the Loretti amendment, arguing that it would prevent developers from taking advantage of a loophole and building right on the Minuteman bikeway. He did not explicitly mention the Pretzer amendment.
</details><details><summary>In Massachusetts, is the MBTA transit authority railway a right of way?  How far does the MBTA right of way typically extend in the Town of Arlington?</summary>

> In Massachusetts, the MBTA transit authority railway is considered a right of way. The right of way typically includes the tracks and a certain amount of land on either side of the tracks. The exact width of the right of way can vary, but it is often around 50 to 100 feet wide. In the Town of Arlington, the width of the MBTA right of way would depend on the specific location along the railway.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article 7 and provide the final vote.</summary>

> Article 7 was a proposed Zoning Bylaw amendment related to step back requirements in business districts. The amendment aimed to change the step back requirement so that it only applies on the primary facade of a building, and also clarified that the step back is to be measured from the property line. The final vote on Article 7 was affirmative, with 140 votes in favor, 60 votes against, and it passed the required two-thirds majority.
</details><details><summary>Please, list a summary for each slide presented by Steve Relivak for Article 7.</summary>

> Slide 1: Steve Revellak introduced Article 7, a proposed Zoning Bylaw amendment related to step backs in the business districts. The amendment is part of a set of articles intended to encourage the redevelopment of underutilized properties in the business districts and create more needed and desired commercial space.

Slide 2: Revellak explained what a step back is. A step back is when the upper stories of a building are set back a few feet from the street. This makes the building seem less big and creates a built-in requirement for some variation in the facade.

Slide 3: Revellak discussed the current upper story step back requirement in Arlington. Starting at the fourth story, the building has to step back seven and a half feet on each side of the building with street frontage. This can make it challenging to develop upper story residential space, especially on smaller corner lots.

Slide 4: Revellak presented a survey of business district step back requirements in other communities. Most communities do not have step back requirements, and those that do generally require step backs for buildings well above the fourth story.

Slide 5: Revellak concluded by stating that the amendment addresses a challenge in redeveloping the upper stories of mixed-use buildings, particularly on smaller corner lots. The ARB voted 3 to 1 at their October 2nd meeting to recommend favorable action on Article 7.
</details><details><summary>List each speaker on Article 7 and summarize what they had to say</summary>

> 1. Steve Revlak, member of the Arlington Redevelopment Board, introduced Article 7, explaining that it proposes to change the step back requirement so that it only applies on the primary facade. He also clarified that the step back is to be measured from the property line.

2. Carl Wagner, Precinct 15, argued against the proposed changes, stating that step backs affect solar access and that the changes would negatively impact abutters on the backs and sides of buildings. He also criticized the lack of public meetings on the articles.

3. Paul Schlichtman, Precinct 9, raised a point of order questioning whether it made sense to continue the meeting on Thursday for five articles, suggesting that the meeting could potentially run into Halloween.

4. Gordon Jamieson, Precinct Child, suggested that the meeting should proceed with Article 10 and then reconvene on Monday.

5. Eric Helmuth, Chair of the Select Board, explained the typographical error discovered on the ballot language for Question 1 on November 7th and how the town decided to proceed with the current language.

6. Jim Feeney, Town Manager, provided additional details on the town's financial plan and how it would be able to meet the stated commitments for fiscal years 24 through 26 within the confines of an override that did not take effect until next year.

7. Michael Cunningham, Acting Town Council, agreed with Mr. Revlak's point that Article 14, the MBTA communities, requires the fossil fuel program and that what happens during Article 12 will have a dramatic effect on what the town does with the article that requires Article 12.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article 8 and provide the final vote.</summary>

> Article 8, titled "Zoning Bylaw Amendment Step Back Requirements in Business Districts," was proposed to encourage the redevelopment of underutilized properties in the business districts and create more needed and desired commercial space. The amendment proposed changes to the step back requirements so that they only apply on the primary facade, and clarified that the step back is to be measured from the property line. After discussion and debate, the final vote on Article 8 was affirmative with 173 in favor and 37 against.

Slide 2: Context for the proposed amendments, explaining that they were inspired by changes to the floor area ratio to encourage redevelopment of underutilized properties in business districts.

Slide 3: A map showing the business and industrial districts in Arlington, which are the areas affected by these articles.

Slide 4: Explanation of the current definition of open space in Arlington's zoning bylaw, which refers to a private yard or outdoor space.

Slide 5: Overview of the three main changes proposed by Article 8, including changing the calculation of open space, increasing the amount of landscaped open space required, and allowing open space on balconies and roofs at any level.

Slide 6: Explanation of the first proposed change, which is to tie open space to parcel size rather than residential gross floor area. This slide includes an example to illustrate how the current system increases the open space requirement as the size of the building increases.
</details><details><summary>List each speaker on Article 8, summarize what they had to say and indicate whether they support or oppose the article.</summary>

> 1. Steve Revlak, member of the Arlington Redevelopment Board, introduced Article 8. He explained that the article proposes to change the step back requirement so that it only applies on the primary facade. He also mentioned that the article clarifies that the step back is to be measured from the property line. He supports the article.

2. Carl Wagner, Precinct 15, opposed the article. He argued that the step back is there to make the building less massive to those that have to look on it or pass by it, and they also affect solar access. He also criticized the lack of public meetings for the public to discuss the article.

3. Aram Holman, Precinct 6, also opposed the article. He argued that the step back will only apply to the principal façade, which he believes does a disservice to the many people who are going to be near these buildings.

4. Eugene Benson, Precinct 10, supported the article. He argued that Arlington is still more restrictive with step-backs than most communities in the area and that the town needs to be competitive. He also mentioned that the article clarifies where the step-back is measured from.

5. Christopher Moore, Precinct 14, did not explicitly state his position on the article but moved to terminate the debate.
