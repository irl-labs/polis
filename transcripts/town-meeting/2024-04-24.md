<summary>Annual Town Meeting Night 1</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 927</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I'm calling this meeting to order. On Wednesday, April 24th, 2024. My name is Greg Christiana. I'm the Town Moderator of the Town of Arlington, and I welcome everyone to Arlington's 217th Annual Town Meeting. As I say every year, please hold your applause until the meeting is dissolved. Let us now take a moment to remember all the Town Meeting members and all the Arlington volunteers who have served the Town and passed away in the last year, including last year, Joan Banks, Dennis Corbett, Bernie Green, Charlie Lyons, and Ed Tsui. And this year, Pat Appetizano, Ted Peluso, Donald Sandrelli, and Corinne Rainville, former Town Clerk. Let us remember them and their contributions and all others who have passed, if I missed anybody during this moment of silence, please. On another serious note, today is, as I mentioned, April 24th, and is widely recognized as Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day to remember the genocide that began 109 years ago today in 1915 against the Armenian people. We remember the 1.5 million individuals whose lives were taken, the survivors and their families, especially those who have made Arlington their home. We pause now to honor their loss. Thank you. In the back of the hall, you can find physical printed copies of the annual report. Feel free to grab a copy at the break or after the meeting adjourns. Let's now turn to town meeting business. The warrant before us includes two articles, a lot more than that, but among them are two articles that seek to change the start time of town meeting from 8 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. I mentioned this in my opening remarks because it affects the scheduling of the meeting and I think it's appropriate to raise this now. One of these articles also seeks to change the end time of the town meeting to 10.30 p.m. I sent a memo about this last week, but just to make this clear tonight to everyone, traditionally town meeting starts at 8 p.m. and adjourns around 11 p.m. On the recommendation of the town meeting procedures committee, I will entertain motions to adjourn starting at 10.30 p.m. on a trial basis starting tonight. Full disclosure, as moderator, I'm chair of that committee, so it's not exactly a fully independent body. Trial basis means that if motions to adjourn keep failing until around 11 p.m. night after night, then I will return to past practice, or we will return to past practice of entertaining motions to adjourn around 11 p.m. So we're going to try something a little bit different that would, of course, since we'll retain an 8 p.m. start time throughout this annual town meeting, that means if the meeting does adjourn around 10.30 p.m., it means that we're going to have a shorter meeting, two and a half hours, give or take, rather than three hours. So that could mean more meeting nights, but shorter nights. And so that's the call of the meeting. Okay. Also, I'm told that when requesting to speak via your electronic handset, which all of you town meeting members should now have, you'll need to press the number 9 button to request to speak. I cannot vouch for what will happen if you press another button. So we're actually going to run a quick little experiment right now for just a minute so everyone can get comfortable pressing 9 to speak, because the check-in was essentially voting, I believe. And so can we switch over to a speaker screen? And let's show the—and so to do this in an orderly fashion, town meeting members, if you're in precincts 1 through 7, try requesting to speak. Can we show the speaker queue up here? I can see the speaker queue on my view, but—oh, there we go. Okay. Is this town meeting members in precincts 1 through 7? Can we scroll down so folks can verify if their request—I see someone pressed 10. I'm not sure whether to recognize that. Okay, great. Now, can we clear the speaker queue? And once that's cleared, town meeting members in precincts 8 through 14, if you can request to speak to see if your name appears in the list. If you want, you can try pressing it again. If you're on the list, you can try pressing it and see if it toggles you off. I don't think that it does. It does. Oh, it does? Okay. So if you want to request to speak, hit the 9 button an odd number of times. And okay, let's scroll to the bottom. Of course, if you take yourself off the list, unfortunately, if you try to get back on in all seriousness, I believe you'll be put to the end of the queue. And so that would be really unfortunate if you were waiting a long time and then you got bumped because of that. So try to be careful with your handsets. I apologize for the finickiness of this system, but this is what we're working with at the moment. Okay. Can we now clear the queue? And now, town meeting members in precincts 15 through 21, if you can request to speak to verify that your handset button number 9 is working. Okay. We'll scroll to the bottom. And eyeballing it. Yeah, I can confirm that's everybody. Okay. Okay. Thanks for working through that exercise. I'd now like to invite the town of Arlington's Mr. Moore, did you? Yep. Yep. Mr. Wagner? Do you have a point of order?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, point of order, Carl Wagner, precinct 15. Could I humbly request that the action to take yourself off the list in the future would be a different key than the key to put yourself on the list? Because I'm sure many of us, like me, have frantically pressed to get ourselves on the list and removed ourselves from the list, probably. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll take that into consideration, and I'd suggest that folks work on some breathing exercises to stay calm, to keep those fingers from twitching too much. Thank you. Okay. Now, I invite the town's Poet Laureate, Jean Flanagan, who will deliver the invocation. Ms. Flanagan?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jean Flanagan - 193</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening. It's an honor to be here tonight and to share my poem about William Dawn Jaws with you. In the spirit of Patriots Day and the Arlington 250 celebrations, most of us know about Paul Revere, but not much about William Dawes. Patriot William Dawes. On April 18th, 1775, Paul Revere was captured by the Brits. On his way to Concord, bayonets at his back, he never made it. It was Dawes who rode to warn the Minutemen, sneaked by the regulars at Boston Gate, went west towards Roxbury, Brookline, and Brighton. Yet, I know of no statues of Dawes, but like many of us, he just did his job, received little credit for his ride to Lexington. His warning led to the victory, the first of the American Revolution. Today, let us remember William Dawes, who when called to duty, focused on the goal and not the glory. As you gather tonight to make decisions for our town, remember it's not always the most boisterous person who makes the biggest impact. May you dwell with the spirit of victory in the quiet light of a job well done. Thank you.</blockquote>

We'll now swear in town meeting members elected in the April election or appointed to fill a vacancy. If we can switch over to apologies for that. Mr. Wagner.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 300</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will. I mean, that's your choice if you want to sing it. It will be performed, yes. Thank you. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. So all new town meeting members, if you haven't been sworn in yet, please stand. Welcome. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We'll now take the town meeting oath. So repeat after me. I, state your name, will participate fully and will fairly evaluate all matters. Actually, you can read the whole thing. So if you want to just read like, okay. Let's start from the beginning. Sorry. I, state your name, will participate. There you go. I, state your name, will participate fully and will fairly evaluate all matters. Great. Thank you. Congratulations. Okay. Can we now bring up the vote to consent to the satellite room? And next time, I'll bring a metronome for the oath, I think. Okay. So the vote before us now is, oh, can we show that again? The, I'll just read it. Can we show the vote screen? Yeah. So the vote here is that duly elected representative town meeting members of the town of Arlington hereby consent and agree to conduct this meeting and address all articles in the warrant by in-person participation utilizing the town hall auditorium and the satellite room in the town hall complex via live audio and video. So now let's bring up a vote screen. If you consent to that vote, press one for yes on your handset. Press two for no. And three to abstain. And this will serve as our test vote tonight. Do we have a countdown on our timer? Okay. Okay. And the vote passes, 201 in the affirmative, four in the negative, and two abstentions. So the meeting consents. Oh, can we show the votes? Yeah. Thank you, Mr. Wagner.</blockquote>

And now precincts 10 through 12, check your votes, please. And precincts 13 through 15, please verify your votes, that they were registered the way that you intended. Let's just get through the screens, and then we'll take the point of order. Precincts 16 through 18, please check your votes.

And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?</blockquote>

And at this highly patriotic moment, I just want to remind folks that there is a vacancy currently on the Arlington 250 Committee to make preparations for celebrations and remembrances of the 250th anniversary of Arlington's role, monotony at the time, in the American Revolutionary War. So if anyone, and especially town meeting members, if you're interested, please let me know. I now recognize the Chair of the Select Board, Mr. DeCourcy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. So it's a little ironic to me that I think I have to do a complimentary resolution. Is that correct, Mr. Moderator? That is a thing you can do. So I just talk or do I have to introduce it in some special way? You can do an interpretive dance if you want. I don't know if that will... You can speak to it. You don't, yeah. You can speak to it. I'll resist. So can we bring up that PDF, please? Yes. Yeah. I don't know if the public has that. Well, anyways, I'll talk while we're bringing it up. I mean, essentially what I wanted to do was express my appreciation to all the town meeting members, be that help to get the reports to the town meeting members, a lot of times the organizer gets a lot of credit for these things, me, but the people who actually did the delivery, me, are the ones who deserve the real credit, and so their names are up there, and hopefully we will get it on the website so you can see, but I can't express how much I appreciate the fact that some people volunteered before I even asked, but those who I asked responded very quickly and very enthusiastically, and that's even more appreciated because I wasn't able to contact people on Monday as I had wanted to because of some unusual circumstances on that Monday, so I didn't get to them until Wednesday, but still, me, they responded very quickly and got you all who wanted hard copies of the reports. So once again, thank you to the 21 people who helped out.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Worden - 696</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. John Worden, Precinct 8. I wanted to say a few words in memory of Corinne Rainville, who was mentioned by the moderator a few minutes ago as the town officials who had unfortunately passed away during the past year. Mrs. Rainville was the clerk from 1994 to 2010, covered most of the period in which I had the honor of serving as the moderator of this meeting, and a little bit of a history lesson. For the old town meeting members, you will remember, and the new town meeting members will say, gee, did they really do all that stuff? But we didn't have any clickers, we didn't have, well, we had a screen, but it was used very seldom. We didn't have votes being shown on the screen or anything like that. It was more of a paper and words town meeting, and the town, Mrs. Rainville, when she was first elected in 1994, didn't need any on-the-job training because she had served in the clerk's office for many years as one of the assistants. In fact, one of her jobs was to sit in the back of the hall there where you got your clickers, but we didn't have any clickers, but you would give your name and she would check you off on the list, and that is the way we took attendance of who was at town meeting. And when we took votes, if it was a stand, well, we didn't have clickers, so if it was a voice vote that was unclear or somebody challenged it, we'd have a standing vote and we'd have a teller in each of the four sections, and they'd call out the numbers and she would write them down and I'd write them down, and we'd add them up, and if we got the same total, we'd announce the vote. If we didn't, we'd go back and check our numbers. So we worked together on that sort of thing many, many times, and if we had a roll call vote, which happened very seldom, now we have a roll call on practically everything, but in those days we didn't, and if somebody challenged the standing vote with a roll call, and I'd read the roll and she'd write yes, no, or abstain, or absent, whatever, and she'd add them up and I'd announce the total. So it was a different sort of thing. But Mrs. Rainville was a very kind and caring person, and there's one story I think illustrates this very well. A person whom I know, a friend of mine, who was going to get married, he suddenly realized on the morning of the day that he forgot to get his marriage license. So he went to the, he called up Mrs. Rainville, she came down here to town hall on a Saturday, opened up, issued the license, and he was able to get to the church, not only on time, but with the right piece of paper in his hand. So that was just a characteristic of the kind of wonderful person she was. And we had a long and happy relationship, and she often gave me a ride home after the meeting, and after the last meeting we might stop at my house and have a glass of wine together and talk over what had gone over in the past however many nights. So I just wanted to say that she was a kind and exemplary town clerk, and she was never afraid to go before the voters every three years to get reelected, which she was four or five times. So when she came out of retirement, and Stephanie Liccarelli, who replaced her, fell ill, she came back to the clerk's office to help the remaining staff get through the rest of that year and through the election that followed. So as you probably, maybe most of you know, she retired to Vermont to live near her daughters, and her house caught on fire, and she was killed in the fire. So that was a very sad ending to a person with a wonderful life. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>Article 2 - State of the Town Address</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen DeCourcey - 1074</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Good evening again, town meeting members, elected and appointed officials, town employees and residents. I want to especially welcome the 22 newly elected town meeting members here this evening. It's an honor to stand before you tonight to present my second state of the town address from the town hall auditorium. Three years ago, I recorded my remarks in an empty auditorium. It is so much better delivering the address directly to you this evening for our second in-person town meeting following the COVID pandemic. Before I begin, I want to recognize Select Board Administrator Ashley Maher and Acting Administrator this evening Britton Mallard for their work in the Select Board Office. To thank Lauren Costa for her years of service to the Select Board and to wish her well in her new position as Budget Coordinator in the Town Manager's Office and to thank Town Council Michael Cunningham and our new Deputy Town Council Jacqueline Munson for their role in drafting the Select Board report and comments. Ashley is not with us here tonight due to the death of her grandmother. We send condolences to her and her family. Over the past year, we have seen numerous changes in the senior management of our community. Last spring, my colleagues on the Select Board and I hired Jim Feeney as our Town Manager. Hiring a Town Manager is arguably the most important duty of the Select Board and we couldn't be happier with the job Jim has done since he started last August. For those of you who have interacted with Jim since he began working for the Town in 2011, you have no doubt seen his commitment to Arlington, his willingness to find solutions to challenges and his demonstrated capacity to get things done. Jim and his management team have hit the ground running and we are fortunate to have such committed employees. We are also grateful for the outstanding service that all Town and School employees provide to our residents. Over the past year, we have accomplished a great deal as a community. We remain encouraged to see the further completion of the new Arlington High School. Phase 2 opened last November and houses the Humanities Wing, the Monotony Preschool, the Central Administration offices, a new cafeteria and a state-of-the-art library. The new gymnasium will be completed next February and the final phase with expanded new playing fields and a connection to the Minuteman Bikeway will be completed in the fall of 2025. We remain grateful for the support of the Town's taxpayers who approved the debt exclusion for the Town's portion of the cost of construction in 2019. I also want to recognize the outstanding work of our AHS Building Committee. Several members are here tonight, including the Chair, Jeff Thielman, who reminded me today that the project remains on budget. Thank you, Jeff. Our new public works facility on Grove Street is nearing full completion and we expect to announce an open house for Town residents to tour the facility later this year. In the meantime, the new Municipal Services Building has been in use over the past year by our DPW and Inspectional Service Departments. Arlington continues to be a leader in implementing climate change initiatives. We are one of only 10 communities across the state that will be moving forward with a fossil fuel-free building construction and renovation demonstration project in the coming years. Just recently, we entered a new contract for our Arlington Community Electricity Aggregation Program. As a result, Arlington will be the first community in Massachusetts to offer a 100% renewable energy default option for subscribers. Significantly, the 100% renewables default option will cost less than the current default option, which, when combined with the state minimum, is at 54% renewables. Arlington continued its commitment to affordable housing initiatives in 2023. As examples, through CDBG and CPA grants, the Town is supporting the creation of 43 units of affordable housing on Sunnyside Avenue by the Housing Corporation of Arlington, providing continued funding for improvements to the Arlington Housing Authority properties at Drake Village and Monotony Manor, and providing rental assistant grants for formerly homeless individuals who have secured rental housing in Arlington through the Somerville Homeless Coalition's Leasing Differential Program. For our senior citizens, the Select Board was pleased to approve a pilot parking program last summer that provides our seniors with free parking throughout town and, in particular, the area surrounding the community center. More than 1,500 parking permits have been issued to date. In addition, through our voters' approval of a ballot question last fall, the Town will be offering a local means-tested senior citizen property tax exemption next fiscal year. These are but a few of the highlights from the last year. For a more comprehensive listing, I refer you to our 2023 Annual Town Report, which is on the Town's website and also available in hardcover at the back of the auditorium. Thanks in large part to our residents approving an operational override last November, Town meeting will be presented with a balanced budget for fiscal year 2025. Moreover, the fiscal 2025 budget will adhere to the override commitments the Select Board presented to voters last year. As I stand before you this evening, the state of our Town is strong. Notwithstanding this, we face many challenges ahead. Although the budget is balanced, the Finance Committee report contains a five-year plan summary that shows sizable deficits beginning in fiscal year 2027. As Town leaders, we must work together to minimize the projected deficits and make sound decisions for our community while also providing the best services possible to our residents. The work we perform over the next two years will be critical to address these challenges. In closing, Town meeting will be asked to vote on 66 Warren articles in the regular Town meeting and five additional articles in the special Town meeting. It goes without saying that not every vote will be unanimous and that speakers will present different points of view in support of their recommended votes. That is the essence of our Town meeting system. As we begin tonight, I am once again reminded of the words of our late Select Board member, Kevin Greeley. We can disagree without being disagreeable. As we have in the past, I hope we take these words to heart in our deliberations this year. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

At the request of the Department of Revenue, the Finance Committee voted tonight to reword two votes in our report, Articles 61 and 63. Our vote on page 26 of the Finance Committee should read, there's no substantive change, but it should read that the sum of $750,000 be and hereby is appropriated to be transferred from overlay reserve surplus accounts of previous fiscal years, said sum to be utilized to reduce the tax rate. And Article 63, similarly, the vote should read that the sum of $8,941,936 be taken from available funds in the Treasury and that the Board of Assessors is instructed to use said amount to reduce the tax rate. Again, these are non-substantive changes. It's purely wording that the Department of Revenue has requested that we make. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 692</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. That takes us to Article 6. Oh, sorry. Thank you, Ms. Brazil, the Consent Agenda. That's a lot of grumbling about the Consent Agenda. Okay. Let's bring up the noted. Can we show the document for the Consent Agenda? And if we can zoom that or make the font as big as we can. Yeah. Great. Thank you. So let me just explain a little bit here. The version of the Consent Agenda that you saw that you may have seen in your printed reports in the packets are a very different format. And the articles are organized differently. Just very briefly, the reason for that is that we didn't have the vote quanta, like majority or two-thirds for all the amendments. And we need that to organize the Consent Agenda into different categories because we take different votes on different segments, essentially, of the Consent Agenda based on the quantum of vote, like what the vote threshold is. And so we didn't have that available at the time, so we broke it down by report. Whereas what you see here, presented here, is organized by three sections. The first section is the, if we can scroll through as I say this, the majority vote Consent Agenda. And so these are all articles that are put on the Consent Agenda through recommendations of the chairs of boards or committees who reported on these articles with recommended votes. And I'll explain the yellow highlighting in a second. I'll come back to that. And so now there's an opportunity. I'll run through these article numbers one by one in each of these sections. And if you want an article to be taken off, first of all, the Consent Agenda means that we will vote for each kind of block of articles with one vote that will be applied to all the articles in that block. And if you don't want to treat a particular article, like say Article 9, which is highlighted here, you want it to be taken off so it can be debated and voted separately from the rest in the normal sequence of numbered articles, then you can raise your hand and you can shout hold. And then I will point to you and ask you to identify yourself so you can make sure that it's actually a town meeting member, identify your name and precinct number, make sure it's not someone doing mischief from the side balconies. And so let's now scroll down to the second block of the Consent Agenda, which is the Two-Thirds Vote Consent Agenda. Can we scroll this down? Oh. Okay, we're probably having a technical difficulty with the satellite room. Well, I can go on explaining. And so if we scroll down, you would see a very similar looking block of articles called the Two-Thirds Vote Consent Agenda, which is a bunch of articles on the Consent Agenda that require Two-Thirds Vote. And then finally, there's a smaller section of articles called the Legislative Consent Agenda that we break out separately because there's some folks who are town meeting members who do work with the state government, a state legislature, for instance. And so they have to recuse themselves from voting on any matter like home rule petitions, articles of that nature. And so we break those out so those folks don't have to abstain from the entire Consent Agenda. Okay. So are we all set over there? Okay. So if we can just scroll down so you can get a view of what this will look like. And we'll run through this line by line, article by article. And you'll have an opportunity as I call out the article numbers to shout, hold. And I'll try to raise your hand or stand, and I'll identify you. And you can say your name and precinct number. And then we'll have that for the records of who held this. And I might have questions for you depending on the nature of the article. Yeah. Mr. Wagner, do you have a point of order? Okay. If we can scroll to the top. Thank you, Mr. Moderator.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 489</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was created just before the meeting. I mean, I have a link. I don't know how I would get it. The paper version of the packet is just not, it's not organized in this particular order. Okay. Some people in the audience may not be able to see in the back what is on the screen. Yeah. So I'll recite the article numbers. And so when I recite the article numbers, if you have a copy, a paper copy of your consent agenda or the one that was published in the packet or a digital copy of that, you can still follow along with the article numbers so you know what articles I'm talking about. It just won't be presented in quite this visual format is all. Okay. And now there's, the last point I'll make is that there are three articles that I've highlighted in yellow because there are reasons why, or there are indications that folks are going to want to hold that article. So I highlighted those so that we don't accidentally skip over those because folks did express intentions or there might be other things that I'm aware of that makes these articles actually not appropriate for the consent agenda. I'll just give an example of one. Article 53, if we can scroll down to that. I wanted it to be town meetings business to take this off, so I didn't want to just unilaterally take it off myself and confuse everybody. Article 53 was reported on by the Finance Committee and the Select Board, but it turns out only one of those bodies actually has the controlling vote for the recommended vote under that article. And the Finance Committee votes, voted a zero dollar appropriation which would make it appropriate typically for the consent agenda and that's how it ended up on here. But the Select Board is actually being authorized to take property by eminent domain, which is probably not something we want, you know, carried in the consent agenda. Because that would be unfortunate if folks lost the opportunity to discuss that because they didn't realize that detail was in the consent agenda. And so that's kind of a big deal. So I've highlighted the ones where I have reason to believe that there are compelling reasons to take this off and we don't want to accidentally leave them on is all. Okay, so now let's scroll to the top. To the majority vote consent agenda. And this is the largest section. So these are articles that require, their main motions require a majority vote of town meeting that's greater than 50% vote. And so I'll run through these right now. So I'll recite the article numbers so you can look at your copies if you have them because the articles are more or less in sequential order except for one exception on the consent agenda that was published in advance.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Katie LaSalle - 594</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you. Okay, can we show an, oh, okay, so we have a presentation, go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. My name is Katie LaSalle and I'm the economic development coordinator for the town of Arlington. Thank you for sharing the sides regarding Article 6. As a part of my job, it is my responsibility to enforce the vacant storefront bylaw. The following presentation will summarize the request to amend Article 17, the vacant storefront maintenance registry, for reasons of bylaw clarification and to remove the public art waiver option. Next slide, please. First, I will provide some background information on the bylaw. The registration and maintenance of vacant commercial and industrial buildings bylaw was approved by a vote of special town meeting on October 19th, 2016. The intention of the bylaw is to promote the town's public welfare and economic health by requiring all property owners to register and properly maintain vacant commercial and industrial properties. Our bylaw has served as a model for many other communities and I am regularly contacted by other towns who ask about our experience using this policy tool in combating storefront vacancies. Following the implementation of the bylaw, our commercial vacancy rates have decreased significantly. Compared to our neighboring communities, vacancy rate remains relatively low at around 8.6% for our regional sub-market. This compares to our neighboring regional sub-market of West Cambridge slash Alewife, who has a commercial vacancy rate of 19.2%. Despite our relatively low vacancies, our business districts take great pride in running businesses in active, vibrant communities and are hurt when our neighboring storefronts remain empty and neglected. Since enforcing the bylaw once again, it has become clear that a few adjustments should be made to clarify the language and intention for the desired goals. Next slide, please. I'm sorry, can you slow down a little bit? I can. More than 25% of the current vacant storefronts are office spaces located on second stories of buildings. Given the current state of work in 2024, it is less productive to target those types of spaces for policy intervention. Amending this language will rectify confusing notions around the storefronts aspects of the vacant storefronts bylaw and reassert those efforts around the town's main commercial corridors. The proposed bylaw amendment would focus the scope of the vacant storefront bylaw to only apply to ground floor units with frontage along Mass Ave or Broadway. Reducing enforcement workload will additionally allow more focused efforts on filling vacant storefronts in higher foot traffic commercial corridors and other economic development initiatives. Next slide, please. Secondly, after speaking extensively with the Arlington Commission for Arts and Culture, we have decided to propose removing the public art waiver from the bylaw. The waiver is currently not serving the purpose of providing public art as a public good to offset alternatively paying a fee. Though well-intentioned, it was a difficult program to manage. Other communities such as Cambridge have solely focused on generating public art in vacant storefronts with great success. Without the funding for a formal curatorial program or the ability to pay artists via the vacant storefront bylaw fee, there is no financial incentive to support this option, nor does ACAC, the Arlington Commission for Arts and Culture, have the bandwidth or desire to volunteer their time to provide their expertise to curate art for these property owners seeking fee waivers. Next slide, please. Oh, sorry. Next slide. Thank you for your time and consideration. Additionally, regarding the upcoming amendment to be brought forth by Mr. Benson, we do not object.</blockquote>

Or people might, if you keep clicking it over and over, you're gonna end up on and off the screen. Okay. Like, we're not resetting the queue, right? Okay, so this is just like multiple clicks probably. Yes, okay. Okay, we have one speaker. Mr. Fisher? Oh, I'm sorry. We did have. It worked. It worked, okay. I'm sorry, we have Mr. Benson that I wanna introduce. Sorry about that, Mr. Benson, who wanted to introduce, let's see, an amendment, yes. And can we bring up Mr. Benson's amendment?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 248</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Eugene Benson, Precinct 10. Good evening, town meeting. I thought this was an excellent warrant article, but in looking at it, I realized that they missed a few storefronts that are right off Mass Ave and right off Broadway, specifically those on Lake Street, Medford Street, Mill Street, and Park Avenue. I'll just give a couple examples. I was at the Region Theater the other night. I hope all of you go very often. And there are a lot of storefronts next to it, across the street from it, just off Mass Ave. Seemed to me they were as important as the ones on Mass Ave and Broadway to be subject to this. Similarly, another example at the corner of Lake Street and Mass Ave, there are a bunch of storefronts, and that building is scheduled to come down, but when the new one comes up, there will be a storefront facing Lake Street. So I thought these four streets should be added because they're sort of right around the corner, and they're just as appropriate to have the vacant storefront supply to them. The other one amendment is just to make explicit the requirement that the advertising materials at a vacant storefront must comply with the usual signage requirements in the zoning bylaw that all the occupied storefronts have. So thank you very much. Ms. Benson, can you actually make your motion? Oh, so yes, I move to amend Article 6 as indicated.</blockquote>

In the text of the change, it talks about financial hardship, and it talks about a showing of demonstrable, undue economic hardship through presentation of evidence in such form as may be convincing and acceptable to applicable town officials. So I guess my question is, what constitutes demonstrable economic hardship, or undue economic hardship, and who are the applicable town officials?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, thank you. One other question, and this was partially addressed by Mr. Benson's amendment, and that has to do with advertising. I believe Mr. Benson said that the advertising would have to comply with the current regulations in the Zoning By-law. But the current regulations- I'm sorry, Mr. Loredi, can you speak more into the microphone? Sorry. The current regulations in the Zoning By-law limit advertising to advertising a business on-site. You cannot put a billboard on your store for a completely different business. Now, we're talking about vacant storefronts, so I'm wondering just what type of advertising would be acceptable, aside from a for-rent or for-sale sign. And in particular, is it contemplated that the property owner will be able to effectively have billboards on these buildings to raise revenue, or some other non-accessory advertising, or just what type of advertising would be acceptable?</blockquote>

Precinct 10, as you noted, Mr. Loredi, the current Zoning By-law says if you have a vacant building, you can't have the sign for the previous tenant, et cetera. You could, of course, have for-rent, for-lease, for-sale, but it would have to be a certain size because the Zoning By-law mandates size in the window coverage. So your understanding is that that's the only type of signage that would be allowed? That's my understanding. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Thank you, Mr. Loredi. Mr. Hamlin?

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Greg Christiana - 1129</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a motion to terminate debate, and we have a second. All those, and so this requires a two-thirds vote. All those in favor of terminating debate on Article VI and all matters before it, say yes. Yes! All those opposed? No! The motion carries. Debate is terminated. So let's now, so there's a lot of detail here. So let's, let's, we're first gonna vote on the amendment, the Mr. Benson's amendment, to the Select Board's recommended vote, and then we'll vote on the main motion, which may be amended or not. But I wanna show in reverse order, because I think that'll make more sense in context. If we can bring up, we're not gonna vote on it just yet. I wanna make sure it's complicated. I wanna make sure everyone knows what they're voting on. Can we bring up, and we'll just kind of quickly scan through the Select Board's recommended vote language for Article VI on the display? Can we bring that up? Okay. Right, so this bolded part at top is just kind of the preface of what's, a description of what's gonna, what's being amended in the town's bylaws. And then following that is like, so that Article VII, it's a little confusing. This is Article VI of the Annual Town Meeting Warrant, but it's amending Article XVII of the town bylaws in Title V. Okay, so the part where it says Title V, V, Article XVII, like that's how it would appear in the town bylaws. So let's now slowly scroll through this and we can see what's being changed here. So any. Any additions will have underlines, and any deletions will have strikeouts. And so we're adding, with frontage along Massachusetts Avenue, Broadway, or both, this is the Select Board's recommended vote. And then adding this financial hardship section that Mr. Loretti was asking about earlier. Let's scroll down. Keep going. And then we have a strikeout of a paragraph related to public art. So that would be removed from the town bylaws in this section. And then adding a main street storefront paragraph. And then striking the word building from vacant building. This is still part of the definitions in the bylaw. Let's scroll down. Yeah, we have point of order in the back. We're reviewing this in reverse order, because I think to provide context of what the Select Board was seeking to amend to the bylaws, and then we'll look at Mr. Benson's in context of that. But we're going to vote in the reverse order. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, so in section three, registration, there's a number of changes in here. I'm not going to read everything, but you can see the strikeout of a unit or any portion of a property, and replacing that with main street storefront. And you can see similar changes throughout. There's some changes in capitalization of vacant, fixing up some grammar. And then there's adding or leased or disposed of in another legal manner. Let's scroll down. This smaller paragraph, more of the same. Scroll down, section four, more of the same. And then there's a new section here in that paragraph, section A, or disposed of in another legal manner like we saw before. And then section B, or item B, replacing building with vacant main street storefront. We're not going to go through this level of detail all the time. It's just there's a lot in here. Item C, a number of changes in here. Let's hold up on this, because this is a little bit different than the others. So this is striking out waivers for public art, which aligns with striking the definition in the definition section. Let's see, we're specifying, it looks like a 30-day, the 30 is new, is that right, 30-day review period? Let's see. Okay, let's scroll down. And let's scroll down further. And okay, this is more of the same. We've seen these same patterns before. It's just being applied through more items here. Let's scroll down. Yeah, and there's like beyond such temporary measures being added, which is a little different than the others, and changing some of the language there about of the entirety of the building being explicit. Let's scroll down. I think we're almost done. More of the same. More of the same. Okay, let's scroll down. And let's see. And then here, a fine of $100. Let's see. I don't remember if the $100 was in the original bylaws as a number. It was just a number. Okay, so now we're actually, we're just spelling out the numbers, it looks like. Okay, so that's not particularly interesting. Okay, let's keep going, keep going, keep going. And that's it. Okay, so that's the Select Board's recommended vote to amend the town bylaws. So now let's bring up the Benson Amendment so we can see that change. Now that you've memorized all those changes to the Select Board's, through the Select Board's recommended vote, what Mr. Benson wants to change here, let's scroll down. So yes, the description here is that there's, we're adding Lake Street, Medford Street, Mill Street, and Park Avenue to the streets to which the bylaw applies, as opposed to just Mass Ave. and Broadway, right? This is in addition to those, right? And let's see, in Section 2, it's leaving the word main from the definition, yeah, so there's some, like, messing with the words here, but also applying these additional streets to which the amendment would apply, and more of that. There's some adjustment of the word vacant, or there's actually, there's a typo in there, vacant appears twice. I think we'd probably just correct that administratively after the fact anyway, I think. And let's see, and then adding a missing article, yeah, it's just a typo, and that's something we can address offline anyway. And so let's scroll down and see what this changes so you can see in context here. So this is relative to not the town bylaws as they exist now, but relative to the Select Board's recommended vote, right? And so, right, you can see where it's adding the additional streets, Lake Street, Medford Street, Mill Street, and Park Ave. Let's scroll down. More of the same. Dropping the word main from street storefront. More of the same. I'm going to scroll down, more of the same, more of the same. And keep going, keep going. And then here, there's one added part here in item D, and must comply, thank you, and must comply with the signage requirements of the Zoning Bylaw to make that explicit because that may be ambiguous otherwise, I believe is Mr. Benson's assertion. Point of order? Yeah, come to the microphone, please.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether the storefront can apply or not, well, debate's closed, so I think that's what we would have to go forward with at this point, so. And Mr. Cunningham's not waving his hand, so I think we're going to be okay. Okay, so now we're going to vote on Mr. Benson's amendment, which is the more recent one that we looked at, and so if you're in favor of Mr. Benson's amendment to the recommended vote of the select board, then you would vote that in the affirmative, vote that yes. So let's open a vote now on Mr. Benson's amendment, which we're going to vote first. Okay, voting is now open on the Benson amendment under Article VI. If you're in favor of Mr. Benson's amendment to the select board's recommended vote, vote yes. If you want to keep the select board's vote intact, press two for no, to not amend it, or three to abstain. Let's keep voting open, and five, just for a few more seconds. Okay, five seconds, four, three, two, one. Voting is closed, and Mr. Benson's amendment passes, 210 in the affirmative, 10 in the negative, and one abstention.

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jim Feeney - 544</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Moderator. So with respect to Article 7, in recent years, we have seen a steady increase in the number of private way betterment projects coming forward. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the number of private way betterment projects coming forward. For many years, the town saw between zero and one projects annually. However, in 2021 and 2022, eight total projects were completed. The changes proposed under this article seek to address challenges experienced during these recent projects with an eye towards modernizing the process. So the first change seeks to make it simpler and, frankly, more likely that a single road or a small group of roads within a much larger private roadway association are able to proceed with repaving their own streets. As currently constructed, the bylaw requires abutters of the private way or ways in question to petition and ultimately get two-thirds approval from all of the abutters within the established association, which can be preventative when there are hundreds of households involved. It would remain the case, though, that only the abutters of the private way being paved would be subject to a special assessment. So this proposed change seeks to make it clear that only those directly impacted by the betterment will have a vote on the betterment. The next change seeks to increase the deposit requirement from 33% down to 50% down. The increased deposit requirement aims to guarantee additional cash flow into the private way repair fund so that additional projects may be approved each construction season. This is important since they're a growing list of projects in the pipeline, and I will note that for the last 11 projects completed since 2020, the average upfront collection rate has been 81%, which means that many abutters pay in full to avoid paying interest or to impact their escrow. However, since the collections are largely received following project completion, the existing funds in the private way repair fund are tied up for any ongoing projects as we need to maintain enough money to cover any final invoices. So by the time final payments are received, sometimes months after project completion, other projects were not able to proceed in that current construction season due to insufficient funds. This can drive up the cost of the project with year-over-year inflation and require rebidding the following construction season for other residents already in the pipeline. So these cash flow issues have ultimately resulted in the town having to require a threshold down payment well above one-thirds be received in order to proceed right away. Otherwise, projects have to wait for sufficient funding to be available. Now at the same time, this amendment also seeks to remove the deposit requirement entirely for a project that will seek or require a borrowing as the subsequent payments can be legally accounted for separately to pay for debt service and do not return to the town's general fund. And then the final proposed change would allow for an electronic petition to streamline the process of neighborhood voting, hopefully reducing both the legwork and time frame required to complete this process, as it is quite burdensome for the neighborhood proponents who decide to take this on. Thank you for considering.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethann Freedman, Precinct 15. I have a number of questions concerning which of the neighbors need to pay and what percentage. If two-thirds of the neighbors sign a petition, do all of the butters commit it to pay? And is it equally or is it based on the frontage? Because if you're on a private way, you actually own to the middle of the street in front of your property, or is it a percentage if it's a cul-de-sac, is it a percentage in terms of how far down the cul-de-sac you are? You know, if you're going to benefit more than somebody at the very end, so how does that work?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Kirsten Allison Ampey, Precinct 13. I'm speaking to ‑‑ I'm rising against this amendment or against this motion article. First, I think the increased number of paving ‑‑ the increased number of projects is predictable because of the timing of the initial paving. Private ways in the town do not see any additional benefit from being in a private way except maybe the parking, but that's really kind of iffy. And so people who are on private ways are forced to pay for this, which is otherwise a provided service by the town. We just went through this with my street last year. So we were one of these people who are one of the many projects that you saw. I feel the 50% deposit ‑‑ requiring a 50% deposit is harmful for people who are of low income. We actually had a couple people on our street who wouldn't have been able to do it if the rest of us hadn't pitched in and paid for their second lots. They could handle one share, but they actually had two lots, and so they would have had two shares, and they wouldn't have been able to afford it. We could have still put it through because of the number of people, but we didn't want to put them into that. But I think having a 50% deposit is too much for some people, and it's not fair for people who are low incomes. Thank you.</blockquote>

Thank you, Mr. Moderator. I'm in favor of this because anything that takes the sections of roads that are private ways, and that goes historically back to the builders that set up those roads and did not build them up to town standards so they could be accepted. So that's unfortunately a legacy from the builders that originally set out those areas, as I understand it. There are several roads that I travel on occasionally. One just a block and a half over, which are in horrible shape. My first question is, does the town have any way of making them at least make it so it's level? Because it's going to, the town plows those roads even though they're not really paved in the winter and it, I'm sure, damages town and contractors' trucks and things. Is there any way we can force people to make a road passable?</blockquote>

I have a serious involvement with Private Ways over the many years. I was one of the proponents and organizers of my own street many years ago. It was a difficult process. It involved a lot of my time personally. The changes being proposed here would streamline the process and improve it, I think, dramatically. I understand about the financial issue that was spoken to earlier. And I realize it can represent a bit of an increased burden for some. But so many streets that are private ways in this town are in bad shape. I think we need to take some drastic action to improve some of those areas. That's just certainly my personal feeling. One of the issues that happened was back when Proposition 2 and a half passed many years ago in the 80s, the towns all stopped accepting private ways as public streets and improving them. And Arlington, unfortunately, was left with the situation it is because they had so many private ways that hadn't yet been accepted. So this is a step in the right direction. Thank you.</blockquote>

And some of the experience that the association had was the impetus for some of the other changes other than the one-half deposit. And I just want to say that not only for the Roads in My Neighborhood projects, but others, we really need these other changes in order to be able to get some projects done. We ran into a couple of major roadblocks, so to speak. So I would hope that if the meeting is concerned about the one-half that we might accomplish that with an amendment, which might require an action at a later time. But it would be really unfortunate to lose, to throw the baby out with that particular bathwater. With regard to the one-half deposit, this is something the Select Board spent a lot of time talking about. And it's a tough call. What persuaded me, and originally the proposal was to even go higher for two-thirds. And I understand the rationale. I mean, the town manager and his team are responsible for planning and for cash flow and for accounting. And this is tricky. It's tricky when you don't know exactly what's happening and you have to respond on the fly. So it's much easier and much better and ultimately provides better service for the town if there's predictability. But the board was concerned enough about the sort of the optics and also the impact of two-thirds that we decided to reduce it in our recommendation to one-half. But here's the important point. One-half or more is what's happening anyway and what's going to continue happening. I think we were very persuaded by the town manager's numbers that he gave to us about the continuing increase that I don't believe is temporary. And these projects are costing more and more. The need is there. Just go and look at the roads. And so what's really happening anyway is that the whole project is going to require at least a half deposit or it just won't happen or won't happen for a very long time and then the costs go up as the town manager said. So but in practice, as I said before, it's much more helpful for planning and for budgeting to have that requirement in the beginning because then neighborhoods know what they're getting into. It streamlines the process. The final thing I'll say is just to reiterate a point that was brought up earlier. Appearance is notwithstanding. The one-half, if we do that, deposit is not per person. Some people can pay nothing. We actually are seeing this happening now. Some people pay nothing. Some people pay a lot more than the one-third that's currently on the books. It's made up for by your neighbors. That's often how it's working in practice. So it will require a change when those of us involved with projects go to our neighbors. We have to explain that very, very carefully. But I was persuaded that the burden is not that great in practice for most people. Thank you.</blockquote>

I have a question that I would like or a clarification I would like to get. And that is with this 50% deposit, what happens when the town is a principal abutter and the traffic on the private way is principally to use town services? Does the town contribute to that 50%?</blockquote>

I am not aware of the town having had to contribute a share as an abutter. I'm not certain if the bylaw excludes us or we just haven't experienced that situation yet.</blockquote>

If the town is the principal abutter, if there's, you know, if let's just, let me say hypothetically, 60% of the land abutting the private way is town land. Does the town contribute to that private way improvement?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The percentage of frontage or abutment, if you will, would not matter. We would be, if the bylaw allows for it, we would pay our equalized share as an abutter. So, what does the bylaw say? I would have to look more closely to see if it exempts the town from paying as part of a private way betterment. I see Mr. Cunningham shaking his head. Mr. Cunningham, does that mean that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, I have read the bylaw. I don't think the town is exempt. But I would like to understand the opinion of council. Thank you again, Michael Cunningham, Town Council. Yes, I don't, I've looked at the bylaw. There is no specific exemption for the town from paying. I don't typically, typically that's not how it works in municipalities. The town does not contribute a share when it is an abutter on a private way. But I'd have to look for the statutory site on that. I just know that in practice, that's not how it's done. There is reference in the bylaw to traffic on private ways generated by, let me say, public service or access to public services. So, I mean, I can envision a situation where the road damage is caused not by abutters, but by, or services to abutters, but by the public using the private way to reach town services. Mr. Cunningham?</blockquote>

Reason for that is the Select Board this evening reconsidered its votes on Articles 8 and 9. There is a town meeting committee procedures report that is attached in the annotated warrant and there's some recommendations in that that we reconsidered. We want to give town meeting members some time to distribute what our votes were on that and the effect of it is we flip-flopped 8 and 9. Eight right now is a will report. Nine was a no action. Eight will, once we get it out to you, will be a no action and nine will be a favorable action. But we want to give some time for town meeting members to consider that. Okay, so we have a motion to lay Articles 8, 9, and 10 upon the table to be taken up at a later evening. And I heard a second. We have a second over here. All those in favor, and this is a two-thirds vote, all those in favor of laying Articles 8, 9, and 10 on the table to give the meeting time to digest decisions that the Select Board made tonight just prior to town meeting, say yes.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. I think there's a presentation. Can we bring up the slides, please? Fantastic. Great. All right. Thank you, town meeting, for your time this evening. I am Claire Ricker. I am your Director of Planning and Community Development here at the town. This presentation will review Warren Article 11, Fossil Fuel Free Bylaw Language Changes. We can do the next slide. The purpose of Warren Article 11 is to see if town meeting will vote to include certain large additions and changes of use in the definition of major renovation and the town's recently passed fossil fuel free bylaw. These types of renovation projects would then also be required to be fossil fuel free under the bylaw in addition to large alterations. Next slide please. First some background. Arlington special town meeting this past fall voted to adopt a new fossil fuel free bylaw which enables the town's participation in the municipal fossil fuel free building demonstration program. Arlington was formally accepted into the demonstration program in February and the town's bylaw officially takes effect on May 21st of this year. Next slide please. DOER has recommended that Arlington revised the definition of major renovations in this bylaw. DOER's reasoning is that the update would align Arlington's definition with the intended definition put forth in its model rule for communities participating in the demonstration program, standardizing how the various fossil fuel free prohibitions across communities are applied. DOER also noted that the definition update would provide a more complete picture of the impact of prohibiting fossil fuels and major renovations. The town's Clean Energy Future Committee voted in support of DOER's recommendation and the opportunity to apply the bylaw to more projects in Arlington given the urgency of climate change. Next slide please. As a reminder, the fossil fuel free bylaw prohibits installation of equipment or appliances that utilize fossil fuels as part of major renovations or in addition to new construction. There are several exemptions in this bylaw including for research and medical facilities, for hot water and large buildings, utility side connections, backup generators, portable propane appliances, extension or modification of existing heating systems, and repair of unsafe piping. There is also a process for waivers and appeals. Next slide please. This slide summarizes the types of projects that are currently included in the definition of major renovations. These projects are low-rise residential alterations exceeding half the existing condition space and commercial alterations exceeding half of the existing condition space or commercial alterations greater than 20,000 square feet. Next slide please. This slide summarizes the types of projects that would additionally, that would be additionally included in the definition of major renovations and therefore would be subject to the requirements of the bylaw. These projects are residential additions greater than 1,000 square feet or more than double the existing conditioned floor area of the dwelling unit, commercial additions exceeding 20,000 square feet or more than double the existing conditioned floor area of the building, residential changes of use, a change of using of use going from residential to another type of use over 1,000 square feet, commercial changes of use exceeding 20,000 square feet or equal to the size of the existing space. Next slide please. This slide summarizes the expected impact of the definition change by presenting the number of projects in 2023 and 2022 that exceeded the thresholds presented on the previous slide and that therefore would have been additionally required to comply with the bylaw as it's proposed to be amended. To clarify, this would be on top of the roughly 40 to 50 projects per year that are considered alterations as part of the current definition of major renovations in the bylaw. In 2023, four residential additions would have been additionally required to comply with an amended version of the bylaw and in 2022, two residential additions. There were no commercial additions or residential or commercial changes of use that exceeded the thresholds. With that, I conclude this presentation. Thank you for your time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Cunningham, Town Council. It's a it's a good question. Obviously, all bylaws are subject to review by the Attorney General's Municipal Law Unit and cannot go in effect prior to approval by that unit. However, because of the timeliness of this particular . . . We did it last fall. It's a very exclusive program to which Arlington has been admitted, one of only ten communities. We've been told that it will be given expeditious appeal by the Attorney General's office to the extent that it passes. So if it's able to achieve that, it would be in effect on that date. If it is not, it would be in effect on whatever date the Attorney General's office is able to approve it. So this amendment that we're voting on, or this desire, this would be in effect much quicker than usual. So . . . I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that. Can you speak louder? So this would be in effect basically, you know, in a month. So okay, thank . . . if possible or if approved. Michael Cunningham, Town Council. That is the hope because there was a . . . there were deadlines in place for the participation in this demonstration project. And for us to meet those deadlines, we'd hope for an expedited appeal from the Attorney General's office. Thank you. Thank you for clarifying.</blockquote>
