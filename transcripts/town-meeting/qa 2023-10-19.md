If planting shade trees is not feasible, property owners would be required to make a financial contribution to the Arlington Tree Fund. The final vote on Article 10 was 4-0 in favor by the Arlington Redevelopment Board.

> Article 11 was a proposed Zoning By-law amendment related to residential uses in business districts. The amendment aimed to remove single, two-family, and duplex uses from the list of allowed uses in Arlington's business districts. The purpose was to prioritize commercial and mixed-use properties in these districts. An amendment was proposed by Mr. Loretti to retain the by-right use of one and two family homes in the B1 districts, but this amendment failed with 55 votes in favor and 137 against. The main motion of Article 11, as proposed by the Arlington Redevelopment Board, was then voted on and passed with 161 votes in favor and 39 against.
</details><details><summary>Please, list a summary for each slide presented by Steve Relivak for Article 11.</summary>

> 1. Introduction: Steve Revellak introduced Article 11, a proposed Zoning By-law amendment related to residential uses in business districts. The article aims to encourage the redevelopment of underutilized properties in business districts and create more commercial space.

2. Business Districts Overview: Revellak explained that business districts make up a small percentage of Arlington's total land area. Single and two-family homes are currently allowed in all business districts. Article 11 proposes to change this so that these types of dwellings are no longer allowed in business districts.

3. Existing Dwellings: Revellak noted that there are several single and two-family dwellings in the business districts today. These properties would become nonconforming under Article 11, but owners could continue their use indefinitely. The Arlington Redevelopment Board is proposing Article 11 to emphasize commercial and mixed-use priorities for business districts.

4. Conclusion: Revellak concluded by stating that the amendment removes single, two-family, and duplex uses from the list of allowed uses in Arlington's business districts. The ARB voted 4-0 at their October 2nd meeting to recommend favorable action on Article 11.
</details><details><summary>Summarize Chris Loretti's amendment for Article 11.</summary>

> Chris Loretti's amendment for Article 11 aimed to retain the by-right use of one and two-family homes in the B1 districts, most of which are along Mass Ave. The amendment would allow these homes to convert from one family homes to two family homes by right. It would also prevent these homes from losing the ability to be used as one and two family homes if they are temporarily converted to a conforming use. The amendment was intended to maintain the intended nature of the B1 districts and to discourage uses that would detract from the desired low level of activity or consume large amounts of land. However, the amendment was not passed.
