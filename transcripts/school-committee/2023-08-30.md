And Mr. Hainer had heard about this discussed and mentioned it to me and said that he would be more than happy to serve as our representative on this committee.

<details><summary>Review and possible approval of revised student handbooks</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 48</summary>

> Okay, so the next item of business is to review and potential approval of revised student handbooks, and the agenda wasn't updated it should just say the ages handbook and the elementary student handbook, which are available for us. Miss home and do you want to leave this.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 255</summary>

> Yeah. So, um, I, so we are in the process of making sure that all of these are easy to access easy to navigate. I want to thank members of the committee who sent me notes on the two drafts that I sent along the elementary one has undergone a fairly significant overhaul and look at we did some revision cleaning up of information that was outdated, or just not common practice. We adjusted some of the dress code language to be more in line with the way the high school talks about freedom of expression but also still with a latitude for us to determine when something's appropriate or destruction in a classroom. I shared with you the document comparison, so you can see what we marked up, and I did a little bit of cleaning and editing based on some comments so I'm happy to take any questions about any specific portions of either of these, they have been looked over specifically there were adjustments to our bullying policies last year when we did an update of the bullet bullying procedures. There were updates to regulations surrounding discipline that require us to do some restorative work before we move towards disciplinary action so we had to adjust some language in the discipline sections, and there's new regulations coming relative to title nine that changed some of the procedures so we had to change some of that language as well so happy to answer any questions that the committee has. Anyone have any questions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 284</summary>

> Is that a. That's not a hand No. Okay. That's just a. Okay. Um, I have a question then the student handbook, the, the elementary school handbook talks about homework policy, and that students should receive only homework, like 10 minutes per grade. For example, 10 minutes for grade one and 20 minutes for grade two except I thought we didn't have homework for those grades now. So this was a point of much discussion for the elementary principles. There are differing opinions about whether or not and how much homework should be assigned. And we haven't sorted through all of those various opinions, quite yet. So what is written here was kind of the compromise that we landed on. We removed some language that we thought was a little bit assumptive about what parents could manage in terms of like reading to with your child at home. And we left this language in there as a general guideline because it is one that some teachers use. And if we were to eliminate it and say there's not going to be any work sent home, then that would be a shift in practice that we would want to discuss with the teachers. So, it's, we, there is not a we don't give any homework in lower grades policy, obviously. And this was this language stayed from the previous version. Does anyone else. I didn't think we had had some discussion about this before and that we weren't having homework and lower grades, although it wasn't a policy. I'm not seeing anyone. I'm not seeing anyone else remembering it. Okay, let's just film it doesn't remember it either. Well, I'm just sunk. Oh, Miss Gilson.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Gitelson - 301</summary>

> As, as the I can't say I know what has been discussed before but I'm curious what if anything you can tell us Dr home in about. I know what happens at Pierce. I think I know what, like, I've only have a third grader but I think I know sort of how it works all the way up. Is there any consist, I mean sort of what, where are we with how consistent because this is a conversation that comes up on Arlington parents listserv and I think some of us who are at schools without who are not giving homework. We're sort of also under the impression that this was Arlington, not just our school. This is not there's not consistent practice on this across the system. So one of the things this came up recently I have my, the contractual superintendents advisory committee, and we had a lengthy discussion about this because I was curious what people's on homework, and I got wildly different answers about, they knew this guideline they knew the 10 minute guideline everybody did, whether or not they did less than that, or at that or shot for that like was what was very inconsistent. I think it's worth discussion I think is worth us potentially revisiting this in future iterations of the handbook, but it wasn't something I wanted to change in the absence of some discussions about it and I wanted to wait for Dr. For Walker to get here to maybe have some of those conversations, particularly as we're rolling out a new curriculum it's possible that El will have some of its own guidelines and ideas around what should happen at home and what should happen at school, and we want to make sure we were aligned with that too.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 152</summary>

> Okay. Any further comments on that. Seeing none. Then I have one other question which is really quickly. I'm Dr home and the piece that I've also seen is really inconsistent is like the reading log piece, which can like quickly get above 10 like that, like, doesn't fit as well in the 10 2030 4050 metric. For, I guess for Dr. For Walker, I would love for that to be something that you guys thought about and talked about why we're asking kids to log their reading. I have an 11th grader and and she logged it every night and it had to go in and I had to sign it every night. wanted to check them every day. And she did, you know, so it was consistently implemented, but that the reading log piece isn't called out here specifically, but it probably needs to be considered in the larger conversation.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane Morgan - 180</summary>

> I have a question about that. Miss Morgan. How is that something that happens at every level is it because you just mentioned high school but this is the oh no sorry this is when she was in elementary school. Okay. Oh no, there are no reading logs in high school or at least that's what I don't sign them, nor would I ever agree to do that. Okay. Yeah, I remember this too and and the reading log can be a source of friction, and it just, I think the, the desire is to promote reading, but it ends up making it a chore, and it wasn't. Anyway, we can have more discussion about this. Okay, so then I had one other question which was about the dress code. So I appreciate that we're trying to be consistent across the district and stuff but when I read it. I was wondering if a student chose to express themselves by showing up in virtually no clothes, whatever sex. They were. I wasn't sure what, where, how that would be handled.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 220</summary>

> Well it says we acknowledge we acknowledge our responsibility to maintain an environment that's healthy and free from substantial disruption or harassment, I would consider that an instance in which we're not in a situation where there is lack of, or we're free from substantial disruption or harassment that that student clothing and shoes can should conform to reasonable standards of health, safety and cleanliness and refrain from wearing shoes, but display words or symbols, expressing prohibited behavior, like that section there, what you just described would fall in that category, to my mind. And then it says beneath that that the administration is authorized to take action instances where dress doesn't meet those stated requirements above. So, that it like I like what I like about this language, and this is borrowed from the high school handbook which I had heard members say and I've heard teachers say they really appreciate that language that's in my school handbook. Is that this gives us latitude to make determinations on based on individual circumstances, but what you just named of course it's not something we would allow, because it wouldn't meet these requirements. We could add more requirements in that second paragraph. If there's language that you think addresses a situation like that more clearly but I guess I just wasn't.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane Morgan - 36</summary>

> To me, I wasn't sure it would apply to that section, and I wasn't really sure where it would apply at all. I'm just trying to make sure that we have standards that can be uniformly.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 98</summary>

> Students can be held to uniformly across the district by all adults, and that things like, you know, the graphics and words and stuff that's easy and you're right that that you know that's very clear and I think that people will be held to that very clearly, but stuff where students are, are not dressing are not wearing enough clothing for appropriate social conduct, it wasn't clear to me how, how that would be handled or, or what what they would be doing. I will qualify that under a reasonable standard of health, safety and cleanliness. Okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 25</summary>

> Okay. Anyone else have any questions or comments about this. Okay. Anyone have any other questions or comments about the handbooks in general, either handbook.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 68</summary>

> Mr. Yes, I think I abstained last year and I'm going to abstain again on the high school handbook, because of the, the requirement to get a doctor's note to get that those absences excused. I did give that feedback to Dr. And I hope that that she'll look at it again this year. But I just think in light of the pandemic, that's, it's a difficult requirement.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 97</summary>

> Thanks, Mr. I have a clarifying question on that one actually, which line, I was doing this quickly tonight and I was incorporating some of your feedback, which line are you looking at with the requirement for a doctor's note, is that on page 15. I don't have it open. Okay. It said in the original, I mean maybe you revised it today I didn't get it before you just sent. It said extended absences or illness with documentation. Hold on. Okay. Understood and I will find it, and I can revisit it with Dr. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 118</summary>

> Yeah, actually, Mr Carter reminds me that I had a question about that also, which is on the same page 15 absences including an exempt from the failure to attend policy absences for the following reasons count towards absence limits above. And the first item is sick days. Paragraph says absences for the following reasons are exempt and do not count towards the attendance limits. And one of the items is extended. Oh, this has been changed. Okay, so extended illness. It just said illness before and I was really confused because it was either illness or sick days and I couldn't tell which was which. Okay, so you've already fixed that. Any other comments or Miss Morgan.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane Morgan - 43</summary>

> Wait, so which one are we approving now we're approving the one that's in email not the one that's a novice Liz put Liz Diggins put the ones I sent via email moments, like I don't know, maybe an hour ago in novice.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 110</summary>

> The master AHS student handbook 2324 on page 15 still talks about bereavement illness quarantine. So that must be the old one. I uploaded the new one so I'm not sure why not. Very minute illness it does say absences for the following reasons are exempt and do not count towards the attendance limits religious services funerals and bereavement illness quarantine and or treatment with documentation and suspensions. No, no, the old one said extended illness. I requested. I had requested removal of extended because in practice, if you're absent for one day and you have a doctor's note, they excuse that absence, it's all tied to the doctor's note.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane Morgan - 28</summary>

> Okay, then, then my question actually stands, I must be looking at the old one. And I'm confused about what's the difference between a sick day and illness.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 76</summary>

> Nothing. In practice, a sick day is you have a cold, your allergies are acting up it's it's an isolated day here or there, whereas an illness is like you've got strep throat you went to the doctor, you know, it's the the minor versus major, I think is what they mean by that. Okay. I see. And they had extended Yeah, I this. So I understand why this feels now murky to you. Dr. Okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 54</summary>

> Okay. Yeah, that's because, to me, what we're trying to do is get people to stay home if they're sick. Right, both for their health. for our health. And we're trying to not incentivize them to do to not do that. Okay, I actually want to go back to Dr. Dengar and discuss this.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi - 17</summary>

> Can we maybe do a first read of this today? Fine by me. Any comments? Mr. Cardin?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Karden - 89</summary>

> Yeah, I was just gonna say, I mean, I think we can approve it with, with the understanding that you're going to make that, have that conversation and come back to us with an adjustment if necessary. Okay, yeah. And we can re-approve it if it needs to be changed. But that way we'll have a handbook out that has, the important part is having all the disciplinary information because we have to have that by law. So we can just approve that. I'm sorry, Kirstie, I should read.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jeff Theilman - 93</summary>

> Mr. Thielman. I think we can just approve this with the understanding that Dr. Holman will make the changes we've discussed. She can give this back to us. I don't know if we, I don't know if we need to take a second vote to re-approve it once she makes these changes, unless we see that there's, it's not right or not consistent with what we talked about. Yeah, we can, we can see what comes back. And if we feel it's substantial change enough, we can re-approve or not. We will decide.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 13</summary>

> Okay. So do I hear someone making a motion to approve the handbook?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane Morgan - 78</summary>

> Ms. Morgan. So which version of these handbooks did I agree to when I filled out the forms for my kids in power school, like multiple iterations ago? When you, yep. When you filled out the forms in power school, you would have been agreeing to the version that did not include our legal counsel's changes for disciplinary language title nine. The version pre-markup, pre-redlining is what you would have been agreeing to. Are we concerned about that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 56</summary>

> I think we send out, so there is a line in these about principals' discretion, administration's discretion to make changes to the handbook with approval and receipt. So I think we message that we made adjustments based on regulations and we notify families of that once we have you all receiving these and that covers us.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 206</summary>

> That sounds great. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Any other questions?  Anyone want to make a motion to approve the high school handbook as presented with the understanding there will be some changes for clarification under the absence section? So moved as Kersey articulated it. Do I have a second? Second. So moved by Mr. Phillman, second by Mr. Schlickman. Any further discussion? Seeing none, roll call vote. Mr. Schlickman? Yes. Ms. Exton? Yes. Ms. Gibleson?  Yes. Ms. Morgan? Yes. Mr. Cardin? Yes. Mr. Phillman? Yes. And I also vote yes. So that's approved unanimously. The elementary school handbook we've received for our information, but we don't approve that. So I think we're done with that section. I'd like to move receipt. Oh, okay. Does anyone want to second Mr. Schlickman's motion?  Sure, I'll second. Okay, Mr. Cardin second his motion. Any discussion about this? I'm moving this just to have it on the record that we've actually done this. Okay, any further discussion? No? Okay, roll call vote. Mr. Schlickman? Yes. Ms. Exton? Yes. Ms. Gibleson?  Yes. Ms. Morgan? Yes. Mr. Cardin? Yes. Mr. Phillman? Yes. And I also vote yes. So that's an anonymous vote for receiving the elementary school handbooks.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Superintendent's Update</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 138</summary>

> Next is superintendent update. I don't have my superintendent update slides created yet for this year. So I don't, and I haven't pulled enrollments today, but I will quickly say we had opening day today. It was a lot of fun. I sent you all a couple of videos and we had a wonderful student panel. We introduced the new cabinet team in its current iteration and everybody on it. And we answered some questions that we drew from a hat that staff had submitted. We had some spectacular speeches from Mr. Schlickman, who was standing in for Dr. Allison Ampey, from Ms. Keyes and Mr. DiLoretto, who is the AAA president. And it was an all-around wonderful day. We really had a great start to the school year, and I'm super grateful today to be in Arlington.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 124</summary>

> That is awesome. And I thank Mr. Schlickman for standing in for me. I wish I could have been there. And it's great that our teachers and all of our staff are off to a good start. I heard that we've actually created enough capacity in the district that we're now doing training for other than teachers, which is great because it means that parents and families are going to have smoother time because some of the other professionals are learning things that are going to make it easier for them to do their jobs and to interface with the families. Okay. Did Mr. Schlickman join the flash mob? He took some pictures of it. Most of the flash mob people had prior training.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 54</summary>

> I know. Dance lessons. And that was the topic of discussion in terms of deeper learning. And the faculty and staff appreciated the reflections of the students as to their role in teaching the teachers and how this is important to build a relationship with teachers and learners. It was beautiful. That's great. Okay.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Consent Agenda</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 18</summary>

> So next we have the consent agenda, which I don't think we have anything to consent agenda about.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Subcommittee/Liaison Reports/Announcements</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 9</summary>

> So after that subcommittee liaison reports, budget, Mr. Cardin?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Karden - 143</summary>

> Yes. Budget met last week, was it, or two weeks ago? And we went over some updates. There will be a I don't want to call it a supplemental budget because we don't really do it, but a budget amendment that will have to go before the special time meeting in October to appropriate contingently the additional $400,000 that the schools would receive if the override passes. So we will be getting a review of what that looks like sometime in September. I should have pulled up the draft minutes, but we talked about potential ways to address some of our hiring challenges with teaching assistants and anything else that I'm forgetting, Jane or Kiersey? I can think of. Right. It feels like it was a million years ago. It was a great meeting, though. And we'll meet again in September, probably mid-September.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 6</summary>

> Thanks. Okay. Community relations, Ms. Exton?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Liz Exton - 3</summary>

> Nothing to report.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 5</summary>

> Curriculum, instruction, accountability, Ms. Morgan?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jane Morgan - 71</summary>

> Oh, we have a meeting soon, and we're going to talk about the special education programs. We're going to talk about the outcomes report. We're going to talk about XBlock at AHS. The CIA subcommittee is super excited to work with Dr. Ford Walker. It'll be our first meeting with her, so that will be great. So come one, come all. Ms. Diggins posted it. I don't know what it is.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 3</summary>

> Facilities, Mr. Thielman?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jeff Thielman - 55</summary>

> Thank you. So the Facilities Committee will meet. I'm going to look at calendars and schedule meetings at some point. Mr. Mason is working on the school department request of the capital plan, and it'll be a chance for us to get familiar with the district's requests. So I'll be in touch about a date.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 6</summary>

> Okay. Policy and procedure, Mr. Schlickman?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 393</summary>

> Thank you. We met on July 24th and had an extensive meeting. We first considered file ACA nondiscrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity, and the vote of the subcommittee was to refer the draft policy changes to town council, who has it for him now. He's going to advise us as to how to word this and how this should work. There's an outstanding court case right now. I think it's in Ludlow that he's really interested in seeing more information on before he gives us the green light to go forward there. This is part of the policies that we're looking to do to align our policies with the June resolution affirming the LGBTQIA community. We voted to go to first reading, which will be in September, on ACA-E, which is taking essentially the DESE guidance for safe and supportive school environment and incorporating that into our policy manual as a foundation for why we're saying what we're doing. JJ-E, co-curricular and extracurricular activities, we voted to forward that to the full committee, including the language students may participate in all physical education, athletics, and other extracurricular activities according to their gender identity without requiring legal or medical documentation, noting that that's the language that is in the MIAA requirements. We also have a revision to AC-R, non-discrimination policy, including harassment and retaliation. The changes there were basically administrative, so the subcommittee will propose to the full committee in September to recommend that we authorize the superintendent to make administrative changes based on addresses and people who are responsible. In other words, removing the former assistant superintendent and adding Dr. Ford Walker on that policy and other instances where that would happen. AC's non-discrimination policy, including harassment and retaliation, there was just a typo in there, we'll be bringing that forward. There's an extent the JLCD administering medicines to students, we're asking the director of health and nursing services to recommend changes there, and there's an extensive revision to ADF nutrition and wellness policy. All of this is in the document of the draft minutes that's in NOVUS right now, so you can get a preview of where things are. We'll probably meet one more time before the September meeting so we can have a resolution of the items that are outstanding, and that's the subcommittee report.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 13</summary>

> Thank you very much. Mr. Thillman, anything for the High School Building Committee?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jeff Thielman - 23</summary>

> We meet on September 5th at 6 o'clock. The turnover date for Phase 2 has been moved to October 30th. That's October 30th.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 13</summary>

> Any liaison reports? Announcements? Okay. Are there future agenda items? No?  Okay.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Executive Session</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 145</summary>

> So next we go into executive session to conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with union or non-union personnel, or contract negotiations with the union and or non-union, in which, if held in an open meeting, may have a detrimental effect. To conduct strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation, in which, if held in an open meeting, may have a detrimental effect. Collective bargaining may also be conducted. And this is for the Arlington Public Schools and the Arlington Education Association, MOA for counselors, and also Unit D. So can I have a motion to go into executive session? So moved. Second. Seconded by Mr. Schlickman. Roll call vote. Mr. Schlickman? Yes. Ms. Exton?  Yes. Ms. Gittleson? Yes. Ms. Morgan? Yes. Mr. Cardin?  Yes. Mr. Thillman? Yes. And I also vote yes. And I believe we will be returning after
</details></details>
<details><summary>Vote to approve APS and the AEA MOA for Counselors</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 107</summary>

> We are now returning to regular session after executive session on Wednesday, August 30th, and we have a couple things to vote in regular session. The first one is a, I forget, are they I'll make the motion. Okay, great. Okay, I move that we approve the side letter of agreement between the Arlington School Committee and the AEA Unit D and authorize the chair to sign on our behalf. Okay. And do I have a second? Second. Great. Thank you, Mr. Thillman. And any further comment on this? Dr. Holman, do you want to just mention what this is for? I mean, the purpose of this?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Homan - 98</summary>

> Yes. So this is an incentive both for hiring and retention of our Unit D professionals who are listed as teaching assistants or building substitutes. And it is really in hopes that we can attract more candidates for those vacancies that we have and appreciate the excellent work of those people who are already in the system. Right. So this is an idea that came up through the budget subcommittee last week and or a couple weeks ago and is one of the ways we're trying to address the difficulty that we're having filling all of these positions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 33</summary>

> So any further comment? Seeing none roll call vote. Mr. Schlickman? Yes. Ms. Exton? Yes. Ms. Gittleson?  Yes. Mr. Cardin? Yes. Ms. Morgan? Yes. Mr. Thillman? Yes. And I also vote yes.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Vote Unit D 2023-2024 SY Retention Payment Agreement</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 16</summary>

> We have a second item to approve. Mr. Schlickman, do you want to make the motion?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 43</summary>

> Thank you. I move that we approve the side letter of agreement between the Arlington Public Schools and the AEA pertaining to special education, social workers and school counselors at the Otteson Middle School and authorize the superintendent to sign on our behalf.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 63</summary>

> Second. Thank you for the second, Mr. Thillman. Any further discussion about this? Does anyone want to sum up what this motion was about for our audience? I mean, what the side letter is about? Oh, sorry. Actually, I think, where's Ms. Elmer? Ms. Elmer and Ms. Keyes might be the best people to explain this. Ms. Keyes, do you want to explain?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ms. Keyes - 56</summary>

> I can, yeah. We're sort of merging duties of social workers and counselors at the Otteson, and this is just setting up some clarifications so everybody knows what they're doing and making sure that when we make dramatic changes, we are checking in on data and making sure that they're effective and adjusting as we go.

> Before you do that, can I just say thank you on behalf of Arlington Education Association particularly for our teaching assistants and our building substitutes. One of the things that happens when we have this good working relationship that we do here in Arlington is we settled our Unit D contract in like six weeks a couple years ago, and then we became the standard that all of our local towns around us beat, so they saw what we got and they all went higher, which meant it made it harder for us to attract people because they held out and had more contentious negotiations, so I'm really glad that we're able to do this. This is going to make a lot of people really, really happy, so thank you all for recognizing these awesome people that we have and the work that they do.
