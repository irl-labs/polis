<details><summary>Open Meeting (K. Allison-Ampe)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison-Ampe - 402</summary>

> Hi, welcome to this meeting of Thursday, May 25th of the regular, of a regularly scheduled school committee meeting. I'm Kersey Allison Yimpe, the chair. I ran up the stairs, which is why I'm like, unable to breathe, and we have public comment. But first, I know that we have some people here for public comment. Let me find my blurb to read, oh, that's good, that's not the right one. Okay, just a moment, sorry about this, folks. A little music in the meantime. Thank you very much for that. Good timing there, you upped the band. There we go, okay, sorry about that, yeah, but that's not exactly right, so, okay. I'd like to review sections of our policy, BEDH, which governs public comment. During the public comment segment of regular school committee meetings, individuals or group representatives may address the committee on items of school business. The length of public participation shall normally be no more than 20 minutes, but may be extended by the chair. Speakers must identify themselves by name and address and will be allowed up to three minutes to present their material. The chair may reduce the speaking time if needed and or may permit extension of this time. Improper conduct and remarks, including use of obscenity or abusive language, will not be tolerated. Defamatory or abusive remarks are always out of order. If a speaker persists in improper conduct or remarks, may terminate that individual's privilege of address. All remarks will be addressed through the chairperson of the meeting. Speakers may offer such objective criticism of the school operations and programs as concern them, but in public session, the committee will not hear personal complaints about school personnel nor against any member of the school community, except for the school committee or the superintendent in their capacity as the operational leader of the Arlington Public Schools. Under most circumstances, administrative channels are the proper means for disposition of legitimate complaints involving staff members. The public is reminded that the school committee does not hold jurisdiction over the performance of school personnel other than the superintendent. And I don't have this written down, but I also want to note that we don't respond to public comment. We just hear, and we may bring it up later or at another meeting. So thank you very much. Given all that, our first public speaker is Molly Blough-Gillis.

> My name is Molly Blough-Gillis, 20 Alpine Street, mom to two LGBTQ kids, one of whom is transgender. I've presented to you many times in the context of our work together to make our schools safer, more inclusive, and more welcoming for LGBTQI plus students. No one can do this work alone and do it well. It requires collaboration, optimism, and generosity. For my part, that approach is highly intentional. It is because as a mom of a trans child, I cannot think too far into the future, not in today's political climate. No one knows what the future holds, no one more so than trans and non-binary human beings and those who love them. Last week alone, Texas approved a bill that prohibits 30,000 trans children from receiving health care that is vital to their very being. Flora ratified the largest slate of anti-LGBTQ bills in one session in its history. Children receiving gender-affirming care there could legally be removed from their homes. The ADL reported that hate crimes rose in Massachusetts by 33 percent last year and had the second highest rate of white supremacist propaganda in the U.S. with LGBTQ plus events targeted throughout our state. The news is painful and terrifying, and as a parent of two LGBTQ kids, I have to do what I can to balance it out in my head and my heart, and I do that through volunteer work here in my community. I need to create an environment that looks and feels very different from what is happening in other parts of our country. I have to believe that that is possible, because if I can't create safety and belonging for kids here in Arlington, in a community that I value and love, what does that mean for the future? I honestly can't bear to think about it. I will say only this in reference to the challenge that was withdrawn. Modern inclusive health and wellness curriculum is critical to safety, inclusion, and belonging for all students. One that is truly inclusive of all genders and identities is this district's strategic vision in action, and without action, that vision is words on paper. Intolerance is on the rise, and Arlington is not immune. It's our shared responsibility to show our students how to lead by example, especially during challenging times. That includes speaking out against bias and inequity and providing clarity around moments, actions, and words that could be misconstrued as such. To me, it also means talking to each other more, creating the human connection that holds us together. In moments when I find it difficult to rise to the occasion, I look no further than to our trans and non-binary children, who demonstrate bravery and courage every day by just trying to be, by just trying to exist. I want and need to end on an optimistic note. This weekend, my family attended a playgroup for trans and non-binary children. It was a beautiful, sunny day. Watching the kids run, jump, play, and laugh together, I thought to myself, there is no greater privilege than living among the magical. Children are the best of humanity. They are what is possible. We only have to allow them to be, to be themselves fully in every possible way. It is our privilege and our responsibility together to enable, protect, and celebrate that magic, that being. Thank you.

> Thank you. Biz LaRose. Hi, my name's Biz LaRose. I live at 26 Park Avenue Extension. Thanks for having me this evening. I have three children at Pierce in first, fourth, and fifth grade, and I'm here to support the new curriculum in the health and wellness lessons in our elementary classrooms and ask you to continue to advocate for our LGBTQ plus students. I know you're all aware of the statistics as they relate to our LGBTQ youth in this town and the disproportionate risk they face of bullying and self-harm. Arlington's kids are cognizant of both the national narrative and local politics. When we do not loudly and proudly advocate for them, they notice. I asked my fifth grader what she thought about the new health lessons that explicitly teach about gender diversity, and here's what she said. I can think of five kids at my school who would not feel included if we didn't learn about trans and non-binary genders. Those kids might not want to come to school if they don't feel like people care about them. Our 10-year-olds can identify the importance of this work for their friends and for themselves. We should listen to them and make sure that all of our kids see themselves in the learning that happens in our schools. Teachers in this district are constantly working to build empathy, acceptance, and respect in their classrooms, and this curriculum offers us another opportunity to both stand with our friends in the LGBT community and to make all of our children better, more thoughtful, and more educated humans. I ask you to please be loud about our values as a district and as a community. Our kids are telling us it's important. Let's listen to them. Thank you.

> Thank you. I'd like to acknowledge the AEA representative who is not C. Ferrante, Ms. Juliana Keys, and next we have our AHS representative who I also hope is not misnamed, Amy Chalmerou. Thank you. Do you want to present what you have?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Amy Chalmerou - 126</summary>

> Yeah. This week has been a pretty sad week for AHS because it was the last week with our seniors, so each day they dropped a different class and tomorrow is their very last day with graduation next week, so that's kind of been the mentality around this week. We've had a lot more outdoor events recently, EcoFest, and then the Pride Palooza, and Scooper Mania were all last weekend, and everyone really, really enjoyed those, and we're looking forward to having more coming in June and then next fall, and our many sports teams made it to the playoffs this year. I think boys volleyball for the first time in like nine years or something, so we're very proud of them. Thank you very much.

<details><summary>Summer Programming Report-ESY & Title I (R. MacNeal and A. Elmer)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 13</summary>

> Next we have the Summer Programming Report with Dr. McNeil and Ms. Elmer.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dr. McNeil - 1107</summary>

> Okay, so this is our report for Summer Programming. These will be the various extended learning programs that are offered during the summer. The first one is our Title I Extended Summer Learning Program, and you'll see many of the structures are still in place. The things that we've updated are just the dates, the number of students that will be attending because that changes from year to year, and what I would like to just highlight is the selection process that we utilize in order to identify those students who will participate in this program, and so it's offered to students currently receiving services as well as others that are recommended by teachers, students who receive intervention during the school year, so naturally they have teacher recommendation, and students not eligible for ESY who will benefit from additional targeted math or reading support, and so the targeted instruction will be reading in kindergarten through fourth grade and math in kindergarten through fifth grade. So that's the ELA and the math program, which is the Title I Extended Summer Program. And so this is just the programs broken down. You'll see there that you have the instructional team, the different teachers who have volunteered to teach in this program, and this is the literacy part of it, and you'll see the number of students who are enrolled. We are offering both in-person and remote. I wanted to highlight that because we want to make sure that we're making sure it's accessible to all students, and then you'll see down at the bottom the focus of instruction. You go to the next slide. This is our math Title I program. You can click on the summer benchmarks, which will identify the various skills that will be reinforced through the instruction, and then at the top, you'll see the enrollment. Again, this is being offered in-person and remote, and you'll see the names of the teachers and the coordinator. Next program. I mean, next slide, sorry. This is our ELA English learner education program that services grades first through twelfth grade. On this first slide, you'll see this is for elementary. You can read the description of the program, and then you can look at the number of students that are enrolled, the participants, and then the dates, and then we keep going, and this is the middle school program for our English learners. It's going to be held at Addison Middle School. The elementary one will be held at Bishop, and you'll see the participants and the dates. The MOOCs is the Massive Open Online Courses, which is coordinated through like a teacher, and a teacher agrees to facilitate this, and this allows for students to attend or receive instruction from teachers that not necessarily, they can pretty much develop their own course, and this provides them an opportunity to be flexible in what that topic will be. The next one is the high school summer programming. This is the credit recovery. You can read there about the selection process. It's going to be in person. You can see the different potential, and enrollment is based upon students in danger of failing. Some students will pass for the year and will not require credit recovery, so I'm not sure that I'm not, we're not sure that these numbers are the way that they're stated here in the slide is that's going to be the actual numbers, and you can see the different subjects that are offered for credit recovery, and you can read about the goal, so they can, the students will be able to complete their course materials within the support of in-class time, and to be able to continue on their planned course of study towards graduation, so the goal is to have those students graduate, and then you have the Plato. These are online courses, a variety of courses offered across all disciplines. Also for credit recovery, students meet in person or with the teacher once a week. Again, you can see the courses and the enrollment, and again, the goal is to have students achieve their credit recovery, achieve the credits, and then finalize their graduation requirements or achieve their graduation requirements. I'm going to pass it over to Allison to talk about the ESY program. So just as a brief refresher, extended school year is a special ed service. Students are individually found eligible through their special education team. That determination is made annually for the student, and the goal of ESY is to prevent substantial regression in already required skills, or for skills that may require extensive recruitment in the fall. We all know some students lose some skills over the summer, and it takes a period of time when we all return to school, but for a student who is receiving special ed services, if that period of recruitment would be greater than it would a typical peer, then they may be eligible for extended school year. As we have done in the past, the programs are located at the Monotomy Preschool, which will still be over at the Parmenter School this summer, the Pierce Elementary School, where rising kindergartners from Monotomy will also attend, the Gibbs School, and then the high school. And again, you see our numbers are relatively consistent as they've been in previous years, and our ESY coordinators this year will remain Joy Schlinger, who is our preschool director, Annalise Abdelnour, who did it last year, and this year, Amanda Donahue, who is a team chairperson at the high school, will also be assisting with the K through 12th grade program. I just want to be clear, because I know this question comes up every year around the scheduling. Like the other programs, they are not set where a student gets assigned to the three-day Title I program that runs from 9 to 12. Each student is individually scheduled based on their services, so a student may receive 30 minutes twice a week of reading and one session of speech. So those all have to be individually scheduled, which is why the schedules aren't set in stone like they are with the other programs. We are working. This year, we're in a better position for staffing than we have been in the last few years, where we have most of our professional staff hired. We are still looking for TA positions, and once those staff are hired, we can then start to make the groupings, and ideally, those schedules will go out to the families in early June. So I don't know if anyone has any questions.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 5</summary>

> Okay, any questions? Any questions?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 53</summary>

> Dr. McNeil, can you just share a little bit about how the literacy Title I support in the summer has changed based on the selection of a new literacy program, the work that teachers are doing in the district around adjusting their literacy teaching practices to align more with the science of reading?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dr. McNeil - 107</summary>

> So most of the intervention we use, so that hasn't changed much, because we use Orton Gillingham and Wilson for interventions, and we still focus within the summer, and we have been traditionally, on those discrete skills that students will need. So that's always been focused on phonemic awareness and phonics. So they're getting those structured literacy routines within the Title I program, the literacy extended learning program. So that's not going to change going forward. We're going to continue to utilize those structured literacy routines to provide intervention. And that has been the case in the previous summer as well? Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you. Yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Karden - 28</summary>

> Anyone? Mr. Cardin? The high school credit recovery program, not the Plato one, the other one, is that new, or do you know when we started offering that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dr. McNeil and Len Karden - 370</summary>

> So this is something that we have been offering the whole time. I mean, I can check in with Dr. Janger to make sure I'm correct. I think the difference this year is that the program is being open to students outside of AHS. I can speak to this slightly too, because I spoke with Dr. Janger about this. So it's a little bit misleading in that the number of students, so it says 10 students there. That's about how many students we would want. open it to, that would be what a full section would look like for credit recovery. We have offered credit recovery in the past. We don't have that many students who actually need credit recovery based on the current status of students' credits right now, and it's kind of hard to teach a class of two or three kids in the summer, which is part of where the proposal to open this up to Middlesex League communities came from for tuition in, but this is a brand new proposal, so I want to qualify that. We haven't figured out exactly what the mechanism would be for collecting those tuitions, but we would set up a fund to collect that in and use those dollars to offset the quality of the programming, and I wanted to make sure that that was shared with all of you before we made any final decisions about it. It would make for easier teaching of the course if we had more kids in some of those credit recovery classes.Okay, thanks. I mean, I feel like as recently as when my son started, which would be five years ago, we were sending kids to Somerville or other places for credit recovery, so I don't know. I can ask. That has not changed. We've offered credit recovery every year that I've... To other places. Oh, to other places? No, no, no. We didn't. I mean, we didn't offer it. You were sending your child. We either did Plato, or we had to go to another town. Oh, okay. All right, well... I'm glad we're offering it. Whenever it started, I'm glad we're offering it. Okay. Thanks. All right. Okay. Anyone else? 
</details>
<details><summary>	 Dr. MacNeal - 189</summary>

> Right, because, okay, I understand what you're saying. I remember it being, at least being presented last year, and maybe the year before that, so I think it's... I can't think of a time since I've been in the district where we have not offered credit recovery during the summer, and we've had these limited selections of English. We've also had science, but yes, since I've been in the district, I think that we've offered credit recovery since I've been here, and that's for the past six years. I don't know. I would... This is a bit of conjecture, but I would imagine that there would have been times when we couldn't offer a class because we had so little low enrollment in it, and might have told a student that we weren't going to offer it, and they might need to go somewhere else. This would enable us to make sure that we can offer a wider slate because we would have more enrollments if we take folks in from other communities. Yeah, that's the new part, offering the $600 tuition based from people from the Middlesex League.

<details><summary>First Read on District Goals for 23-24 (E. Homan)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 24</summary>

> Okay. Any other questions, comments? No? Okay. Thank you very much.  Next, we have the first read on the district goals. Dr. Holm.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 122</summary>

> Okay. Hold on one second. Let me pull them up. I'm just going to share the document. I don't have slides with these goals. We can just reference the document that they are on. These were reviewed in CIAA subcommittee. They are pulled directly from the milestones in the strategic plan and for each of the initiatives. So, there are 12 goals aligned with the strategic priorities and the initiatives in the strategic plan. The outcomes for each year and by year are also included in the strategic plan, and if there's a desire to add any more information about our plans for next year and outcomes for next year to this document, I'm happy to include that or take any comments.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 227</summary>

> Does anyone have any comments? I don't see any. I actually have comments. So, I'm sorry. I wasn't able to attend CIAA, so maybe that's why everyone else has already spoken, but I was just wondering about converting them a bit more towards the SMART goal format, partly because I'm looking at it with an eye as chair that what I'd like to be able to do is sit down and go, okay, we have this report or this thing coming at this point so I can put it in a meeting going forward. So, we know when things are going to be done during the year, but I haven't had a chance to talk it over, so I don't know. Okay. I don't have a response right this minute. Okay. I would have a question about SMART goal doesn't, I wouldn't necessarily associate with a timeline, but I could think about how to do that. Well, that's what the T part is, right? Sure. But it's more just what are we getting and when are we getting it is kind of what I was wondering about. Okay. So, we can talk about it more online. Okay. Okay. Anything else? No? Okay. Other than that, I thought they looked very nice and it's great how they just come right from the plan. It makes it much easier.

<details><summary>After School Programming Report, Policy KFD (M. Mason)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 9</summary>

> Next is the after school programming report. Mr. Mason.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Mr. Mason - 1050</summary>

> Hold on. Good evening, everyone. Good evening, school committee members and those that are here. I don't know if they can see it. All right. Today, I'll be presenting to you after school program report, which includes an overview of school year 2022 and 2023 overview and then a kind of a preview or a projection of 2023-2024 and include a financial summary. In Novus, the presentation would have been updated to include more recent figures on the financial report. There were some figures that were not disclosed. So, the first slide is this current school year, current enrollment and where we've ended off with our wait list, self-reported by each of the vendors that are licensed spaces in our building for after school programming. So, the overall enrollment was 630 students for this year or currently, not was but is, and 94 students overall that they believe are still identified themselves as on the wait list. But many of the vendors say that the families have found other options. It's not that they're not getting the services. They're just not getting the services in the schools under their programs. If you go to the next slide, that is the preview for the upcoming year and based on the current enrollments. And what you'll see is that most of the schools are, what they actually have enrolled for next year, have at least increased except for the Bishop, which is showing a decrease currently of nine students, and they have a wait list of 14. And you'll see that overall, all schools' enrollments or anticipated enrollments in terms of what's actually enrolled and what's on the wait list for students have overall increased except for the Dallin School, which is actually seeing 10 overall students currently seeing less. And so sometimes just thinking about the challenges, their challenges are very similar to what our challenges have been. It's been around recruitment, not necessarily that space is not available, it's just that they cannot recruit enough individuals to be able to support the enrollment or the desired days that families want. If you go to this slide, this is for our internal Arlington after-school program and our by-school, the enrollments in the wait list for this year. And so, you know, overall, our... I thought you were over time. Yes, I am. Thank you very much. I thought about it for a second. I said, oh, that was quick. I guess we're really trying to get out on time today. The audience has had enough. Yes. Thank you. No, no, no, no. That tells me to speed things up. So the overall enrollment for our internal after-school program is 427 students across all of the schools. And the wait list ended around 133. And similar to what I just spoke about, the challenges for our internal programming is not necessarily space, per se. I mean, space is always a challenge. But it was stable staffing. And we've increased salaries this year to try to make it more competitive, to attract more staff to support the program. And I think there's still some challenges and work to be done in that area. But overall, 133 is the wait list for what we dealt with this year. So if you go to the next slide, which is for our upcoming year enrollment, overall, the enrollment is 457 that we've actually been able to enroll for the upcoming year, which is about 30 students higher. So all the schools are seeing an increase. There seems to be less of a demand at Pierce if you consider that the wait list is lower. But overall, all the programs are able to accommodate more students. Go to the next slide. So this slide compares the actual tuition costs on a per-day basis for the programs. This is estimates, I would say, because it's a little challenging. The one program that's challenging that does not do it by day is the Bishop. So that price could be off by a little bit, meaning it could be slightly undervalued, actually maybe a little bit higher than what's shown here. But you'll see that all the other programs are within $5 of each other. And then if you go to the next slide, it's the upcoming tuition for the upcoming school year by day. And you'll see that the Arlington After School Program is going to remain the same cost, and so isn't the Dallin Program, that's by outside vendor. But all the others are going to increase between $2 to $3 to cover their increase of costs. And if you go to the last slide, it just gives you an overview of all the finances for the three vendor programs, and then Arlington Public Schools Internal Program is to the right. To note that there is a higher director salary, obviously, for the Arlington School, Internal Arlington Public School Program. But that program oversees four different sites, I'm sorry, five different sites. And so I would just keep that in mind to note. And obviously those prices is a larger cost. But it seemed like a very efficient program considering all of the other, when you compare the total cost to all the schools. Give it to the chair. Oh, I'm sorry, one more. Steps. That's next, Michael. Yes, what's next? So we will continue to focus on trying to find opportunities to provide more spaces for the programs. That's always been the challenge in trying to incentivize even possibility of getting more teachers on board in terms of giving up some of their spaces. And then, of course, last year I think it's the same thing. We need help. Get more staff. So please let your friends know if anyone has any interest, looking for a job. And we do intend this year to do a market analysis on the rental costs. It seems as though we might be under the market in terms of what we're charging at base, in terms of what we charge outside vendors, and including the discount that we charge our long-term rentals, which include the vendors that run for after-school programs. So I just wanted to put that out there. And then I'm going to hand it over to Dr. Holman.

<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 314</summary>

> So we had some success at Pierce. We learned a lot and actually have between 50 and 60 kids showing up in the mornings, which is great because it means that they're having some time to socialize, connect with their peers, and more students are eating breakfast. Given that success, but the fact that we also have very low enrollment from the 7 o'clock to 7.30 hour in the tuition-bearing part of the before-care program, and even after cutting some of the tuition for that down considerably to try to alleviate some of the concerns around it, we still have to incentivize the staffing pretty significantly in order to get people to be there that early in the morning. And it's just not paying for itself. So we're likely going to stop the 7 to 7.30 before-care programming time, but keep 7.30 and actually do sort of a relaunch and re-examination of the programming from 7.30 to 8 o'clock around breakfast to try to incentivize more families to come. One of the things that's great about the breakfast program is it provides our students who spend some time on the bus commuting from Boston in the morning with some breakfast time and some being at school and social time in the morning. We love it when their peers are also there with them to participate in some of that. So we would really like to see that resource more utilized, particularly by families who have an early schedule and need to get to work a little sooner. And so we're going to be taking a look at that and using peers, like I said, as a model of success and seeing what we can do to increase participation in 7.30 to 8 o'clock breakfast programming that will be of no cost to families. So we'll look forward to updating you on that next year.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Karden - 157</summary>

> Thank you. Any questions? Mr. Cardin. So with our own after-school program, like at Thompson in particular, is the constraint rooms or staff? It's staff more so, but there's been challenges around some schools like such as the Bracket. For example, you have multiple programs going into one building. It's challenging to identify space when you're having multiple programs in the building. So you have the immersion program, then you have the Bracket after-school program, which is the vendor. And then you have also community ed also doing programs, which is not reported here. Some of their programming has enrollment that overlap with the different programs in the building, but as well has other students that may not be placed in those after-school programs as well. So I know we had planned to have conversations with principals and with Todd or with the individual programs depending on the schools. Have those happened or when are those happening?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 106</summary>

> So we did that with every single school last year. It took a lot of resources and time to talk about space considerations and what our expectations were. And we didn't do a round of that this year, which isn't to say that Michael meets with Todd frequently. With the after-school program directors, we established some good relationships doing that last year. And the expectations have continued to see an increase in enrollment and capacity from this year's numbers to next year's numbers. So while we haven't done a round of that this year, we could revisit that and do another round of it next year.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 189</summary>

> Yeah, I mean, one of the rationales for taking over the Pierce program, for example, was that we thought that our programs would have bigger capacity, right? And it's looking like our programs are smaller than the private programs at Dallin in particular. So I'd still like to see us boost capacity. I don't know what that's going to take, but I think we need to make more effort to boost capacity, particularly in our own run programs because we have direct control over that. And then, again, looking at our own programs, there seems to be an imbalance between Pierce and Thompson. At Pierce, we have seats that cover a much greater share of the school. It's a much smaller school than at Thompson. So that doesn't seem equitable. So, again, if it's just a staffing constraint, then, you know, I know you can't just shift one person and voila, move seats. And you can't move seats because you've already accepted people. But as you are able to hire more staff, it probably should go to Thompson first because that's the school that's most underserved, statistically speaking. Thanks.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 54</summary>

> Mr. Schluckman? Two questions. Two questions. Number one, when we look at the waitlists, I know that there are people who put their names on multiple waitlists. Are we able to call out duplicates from waitlists that are across different schools? Do we know if these are unique people or could this be reflecting?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 56</summary>

> I would answer to say I'm pretty sure that these are unique individuals, except I can't speak to the Brackett School because the Brackett School has multiple programs. But many of the times, the families are enrolled into the program at that particular school because there's no transportation being provided to after school, to another school.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 15</summary>

> Okay. Are parents' teaching assistants, in any instances, being employed in the after school programs?

<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 40</summary>

> Yes, there are. I think we did actually, at some schools, shift schedules to allow paraprofessionals to come in around midday, right around lunchtime to do some lunch coverage and then help the instructional portion and then they would switch.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 212</summary>

> Oh, I know in my past life that they would do that as an extra job, so to speak. Yes. But there's some concern around, so one of the challenges that we were trying to address when we were shifting the use of the paraprofessionals to do that was some of the roles that were in the after school program, that's Arlington's, employees were getting to a point where they were getting status of benefit eligible and the concern was how to keep the cost affordable, I mean the program affordable for the families and so we felt that it was effective to be able to cost share between the, you know, how do we leverage them during the instructional day and then as well be able to use the same staff and have the, you know, see the children see the same staff in the after school program and share the health care costs. If the teaching assistant is a full time employee from start of school to the end of school, and they're doing this as an add-on, as overtime, they should already be eligible for benefits because they're a full-time employee, right?I would have to look at how many staff were in that, but could you speak to that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 98</summary>

> Well, I think the after-school program, if they only work in the after-school program, they're still eligible for benefits because they're like 25, 26 hours a week, and that is over the threshold for benefit eligibility. In some cases, they've shifted the schedules where they work basically 8 to 4. They kind of will start in the after-school program and leave, you know, do like one class in the after-school and then leave because they've been here since 8 o'clock in the morning. So we've adjusted it that way, so we are also mindful of the overtime expenses.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 71</summary>

> Yeah, in a past life, I mean, I had all my parents were clamoring for the after-school jobs as an additional salary. I was just wondering if there was some sort of a barrier that we have maybe in our contract or in terms of practice that might be getting in the way of offering some of the younger, more energetic folks the opportunity to work longer hours for additional money.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 48</summary>

> Yeah, I mean, there's different pay rates for one thing, so, you know, we were abiding by the Unit D contract for the paraprofessional positions. Some people also have after-school positions, and we sort of have to straddle different pay rates for those positions. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Jeff Thielman - 72</summary>

> Mr. Thielen. My answer is slip in too, if you want. You. You, that's fine. Policy KFD asks for the availability of surplus space within the district to accommodate the needs of families requesting extended day services, so I'm curious to know what's the surplus space available? Like how many, is there any calculation of how many classrooms we aren't using that we could use?  Is there any data on that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman and ? - 624</summary>

> Classroom space is not the challenge. We have plenty of that, and we've been clear that the building is a town building and it's for services like these to take place throughout the day. Some challenges are custodial timing, because we want to make sure that if the kids are in those rooms, that they have time to be cleaned afterwards. Another challenge is shared large spaces, so all of the programs want access to the larger shared spaces, because you can have more groups in that space at any given time. I think Mr. Cardin raises a really good point, that we've been able to accommodate more families in some of our vendor programs than we are in our own program, and that we need to look into that, and that space shouldn't be the issue that prevents us from doing that if we're able to fit 170 students at Dallin. I know that staffing and pay rates could be something that we need to look into to determine whether or not that's part of the challenge associated with staffing, and also practices around how we roster and then staff versus staff and then roster. So there should be enough space, would there be enough space to accommodate 200 more students in the district, whatever the number is, if you add up whatever the... So if you look at the wait list... I'm talking about both the vendor and our program. If you add up, that's like, it's about 220 if you add up both. Where, at Brackett? No. Where are you looking? No, you're talking about all the wait lists. All the wait lists. The whole thing. Vendor and... It matters more to look by school, because if you look at any one school, like if you look at the Hardy program and you take the wait list plus the enrolled for next year, that's 170. If we fit 170 in the one program that's at Dallin, then it's reasonable to expect we could fit 170 at the Hardy. If it's, you know, at Thompson, you have 125 plus 65, that's... Whether or not we have the room to accommodate that entire wait list is something we'd have to look into at the space at Thompson, because we run a lot of ACE programming out of Thompson. They use, for example, the multi-purpose room. So, you know, what the actual space capacity of Thompson would be, would be a good question to ask, because they're the ones with the highest level of both enrolled and wait-listed families. I think when we wrote the policy, the idea was to ensure that the district was maximizing space, and that space wasn't an excuse to the extent reasonable. Obviously, there are issues with janitorial services. I understand that, but that was sort of the idea, that we were going to try to use every possible space. Mm-hmm. There are stressors placed on teachers, too. I'm aware. I'm aware of that. After school. But when we had that debate, the resolution was to maximize the space. Yeah. I would say that, if I could add, that this year, we, I mean, so there's multiple programs obviously trying to tap similar spaces, but I think we, what you don't see in this report, which is what you're kind of alluding to, what the surplus spaces are, because we did do some negotiating between the programs this year, and increasing, actually, our Arlington community education access to spaces as well, which before, they only were able to offer certain programs at certain buildings, and now, for the most part, most programs that they offer is pretty at parity at all the elementary schools. Okay. All right. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 134</summary>

> Okay. I have two questions. One is, is there any, so I know that there are families who are enrolled in particularly the Arlington after school programs, but don't have all the days that they want or need. Is there any way to parse out how we're doing, like how many, sort of how you, like, there are families that are enrolled and on the wait list, as far as I understand, and I can't ... You used your microphone. Oh, I'm sorry. So I'm asking about the families who are enrolled, but also on the wait list, because they want four days a week, and they're only getting two, or something like that. If there's a sense of how prevalent that issue is, or if I'm just hearing about the ones that are.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 119</summary>

> Yeah. In terms of the numbers here, I can't give you a clear answer, in terms of how each program is calculating that, in terms of their wait list. I think that's, it's worth a look, and maybe looking at it as almost like a full-time equivalent student, right?  Yeah. Throughout a week, right? Each day is .2, and I'll, maybe this year I'll try to work on that with the programs, to try to find a consistent manner in terms of what they're reporting, so then we can say, this is what students are not, like what families are not getting every single day, and then these are the students that are not getting placed at all.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 76</summary>

> And sort of related to that, I know that some families in that position are using both Arlington Afterschool, so I know the most about what's happening at Pierce, and we have three different buses who come to Pierce to go to Fidelity House, Boys and Girls Club, and Ready, Set, Kids, and I realize that that would be much harder data for us to track, but do you, how do you think about that demand?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 119</summary>

> So I think there's a conversation that does need to be had in thefuture, I'm going to try to gather all the afterschool program vendorstogether, I haven't done that for quite a bit, but what I will say is,through this reporting process, some of the afterschool programvendors have talked to external vendors, like the Fidelity House, andthere's actually the concern that if we increase the capacity of theprogram in our schools, that some of these other programs may go outof business because they don't get enough students to enroll in thoseprograms. And so, I mean, there's a balance that's being played here,that's what one of the vendors kind of reported to me about some ofthe conversations that's been had.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 122</summary>

> Well, in that context, I would just, you know, maybe, I don't know if there's a survey to be done of families, those programs, some of them tend to be a lot more expensive because of the transportation needs, and then also, for families, you know, if your kid is in school on one side of town, and you live on one side of town, and there would be a strong preference to be at the neighborhood school over the privately run program, so I, of course, don't want anybody to have to go out of business, but, you know, I know people driving all the way across town at 530 to get their kids instead of walking two blocks, so, absolutely.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 3</summary>

> Any more questions?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 111</summary>

> I have an answer to Mr. Cardin's question, because I do not want to leave anybody wanting for information. So, what I did was I sent a text to Dr. Janger, and he replied in order to give me those details about when the credit recovery was offered, so PLATO has been in existence about since eight years ago, and then, since COVID, we've been offering in-person credit recovery, so. It's a great accomplishment that we should be celebrating. Right. So, I just wanted to make sure that I clarified that, because I kind of, I left that answer kind of up in the air. Great. Thank you. Great. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Holman - 97</summary>

> Actually, I wanted to go back to the after-school programming. So, I guess when we're thinking about days, or people, like Ms. Gibbelson was talking about, about people not having spots, I think the demand is not consistent across days also, so that's a question is, how many, what's peak demand, and how much of that are we able to satisfy? And by we, I mean, actually, everything in town, because it's, I realize it can be difficult for the programs to kind of add staff, you know, have different amounts of staff during the week, so.

<details><summary>Update on APS Strategic Plan (E. Homan, L. Kardon)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 122</summary>

> Great. Any questions? No questions. Moving on. Where are we? So next is the update on the APS strategic plan, and this is Dr. Homan and Mr. Cardin. I didn't put this agenda item on, so should I? I'm sorry. Yeah. No, no, no. So I had asked to have it put on because I wanted to be sure that everyone had access and saw the cost summary just so that the rest of the committee knows the cost summary work that's been done and that will be presented to the Finance Committee next week, and I didn't want us to be presenting it out without you folks seeing it first. Mr. Cardin, would you want to talk through it real quick?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Karden - 282</summary>

> Sure. So you've seen the bottom line numbers, which are, if you can scroll down to the bottom, which are, you know, the $1 million in the upcoming fiscal year, $3.1 million, then $1.7 million, $6 million, and $3 million. So what happened was as the strategic plan was being finalized, we were also at the same time talking with the Long-Range Planning Committee about a new five-year plan for an override, and it was all coming together at the same time. So Mr. Mason and Dr. Holman did a lot of work in putting together estimates of costs, even though things were still being finalized. So we went back and refined some of those estimates. We obviously left the annual amounts the same, but we were more clear about, you know, this amount for this initiative and each year, and so that's set out in this more detailed view, which we will present to the Finance Committee next week. So the numbers all tie out, and there's a little bit more detail here in the, I think we call it items, column about what that spending is related to. And that's also in the strategic plan, if you go back to that big document, it's just a summary. Yeah. So any questions, comments about it? You're all welcome to join us. We meet with the Finance Committee at 730 at the Community Safety Building on Wednesday. So it's to give them a chance for us to present the strategic plan and for them to ask questions about what's being funded and why we're asking all this and why we feel we need an override for the town to pay for everything.

<details><summary>METCO Resolution for MASC Delegate Assembly (P. Schlichtman)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 14</summary>

> So, okay, great. Next we have a METCO resolution, which is from Mr. Shultz.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 155</summary>

> Thank you very much, Madam Chair. When we went to visit METCO in March, the discussion was, as they were preparing for their lobbying day, that their funding is totally by the whim of the legislature. In other words, it's all subject to appropriation. Their school funding has a formulaic approach instead, so that there's a baseline of funding that they can expect, but the METCO folks expressed the desire to have some more stable funding so they didn't have to spend quite as much time lobbying and advocating to at very least stay in one place. So in that discussion, we talked about presenting a resolution to MASC to support MCAS in their quest for a stable, reliable funding source, and so I'm presenting to the committee this resolution. And if you vote this tonight, we will forward it to MASC for the Delegate Assembly to consider. So I move adoption of the resolution.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 9</summary>

> OK. Second. Any questions or comments about the resolution?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Liz Exton - 48</summary>

> Ms. Exton. I just want to say thank you to Mr. Schlickman for putting this together. I think it's really important that the METCO program has the stability of the funding that they need in order to support their students and support the programs. Thank you. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 45</summary>

> OK. No further questions? All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? OK. That's a unanimous vote. Thank you. So do you need, will you send it in? I will send it in to MASC. OK. So I don't need to sign anything? No. OK.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Policies and Procedures (P. Schlichtman)</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 6</summary>

> Next, we have policy and procedures.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 455</summary>

> OK. Policies and procedures has met a couple of times when we finally hashed out where we think we need to be in terms of the policy surrounding curriculum and general complaints. So we have a series of policies. Now, as you recall back in the April, the first meeting in April, we had a moratorium on file IJ-R because it wasn't doing what we wanted to do. That moratorium expires tonight. So that if we do nothing tonight, IJ-R comes back and that's not the desire of the subcommittee. What we desire to do and we proposed to do is to take some of the language regarding the parent complaints and questioning of curriculum and other items in the district and merge that into file KE, the public complaints policy. You'll note in NOVUS, there are two different versions. One version contains a one-word addition by Ms. Morgan. Just to make a request that the staff member receiving request, respond to it promptly. So I would recommend the file KE with Ms. Morgan's proposed change. Now, for all of the other policies with the exception of KE and the deletion of IJ-R, we can do this very comfortably first read and it's not going to impact anything if we do the second read on those policies at the next meeting. But because the moratorium on IJ-R expires tonight, we would either need to do one of two things, would be to continue the suspension of IJ-R for another three weeks of the next meeting or to vote to suspend the rules to move IJ-R, the deletion of IJ-R and the changes to KE to a second reading tonight. Mr. Thielman. I'm not the chair. I'm sorry. I think we should just do the extension of the suspension and then do everything at once so it's clear to the community of what we're doing. I thought about it. You talked to me about it beforehand. I needed to process it. So I move extension of. Suspension of the rules. To extend? No, to suspend the rules and move. You make the motion, I'll say. OK. I'll make the motion. To suspend the rules to move policy KE as. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not suggesting. No, we're just moving. Oh, you want to move the moratorium? Just the more of the. Oh, you want to extend the moratorium? Yeah, moratorium is strong where I just extend the suspension. OK. I was going to use the word suspension. But I want to extend the suspension of policy IJR until our next meeting. OK. That's what I was going to suggest. Either way works for me. Yeah. OK. Do I hear a second?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 166</summary>

> Second. OK. So. I'll speak to it briefly. But so the committee has, as Mr. Schlickman said, the committee has come up with a new plan. The new plan is to eliminate this policy and come up with something that Dr. Allison Ampey and all of us worked on and came to an agreement on. And so by extending this until the next meeting, we can, we can, the public can see all these policies and then we can talk about it more fully at the next meeting and explain what they're all about. Generally, what they're about is there's a, they give the public a chance to voice concerns about curriculum and resources. And then they give a mechanism by which the school committee can take an action and listen to concerns about curriculum and resources. That's really it. So it answers, it allows a dialogue as was expressed earlier. And it allows a process by which we can resolve it by vote. That's it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 58</summary>

> Any further discussion of the move to continue the suspension until next meeting of IJR? Seeing none. All those in favor of continuing the IJR suspension say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? So that's unanimous. So IJR continues to be suspended until our next meeting which is June 15th. And then you want to talk about it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 66</summary>

> There are a couple of other things to deal with. DEE is a minor change which is a clarification of the use of the policy pertaining to public hearings. Just to make it clear, this policy only applies to policies mandated, public hearings mandated by the state. If we're doing our own informal hearing, we use our own regular rules. So I move adoption of BEE.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 21</summary>

> Second. Any further comments about BEE? Hearing none. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions?  OK. So that's unanimous.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 129</summary>

> And so now BEE has been revised and adopted. And I just want to make note of IGD that we ran that through first reading in April. But we didn't put it on for second read tonight. That will be in the package of second readings for the meeting of June 15th. And that concludes the report on the policies. I just want to add one thing is that IGD just since we talked about it a month ago, just as a recollection, that includes language the superintendent added specifying when we would vote on curriculum. Yeah. It's a very thoughtful policy. And I think it aligns with what we've been doing in the past. But it just puts in writing a good practice that we've actually been doing.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Approval of Job Descriptions</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 24</summary>

> OK. Anything more in the policies? That's it. Seeing none. We move on to job descriptions. And I didn't actually put initials on these.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 256</summary>

> OK. So we have three job descriptions. One is a family liaison job description. When we had budget conversations, this just for reminder is a position that is in the ESSER grant for this year. It is assigned to the Gibbs School. It was offset in the general fund budget, not in the ESSER budget, but the general fund by elimination of a 0.5 clerical role and is it was originally talked about as a transition support, which it is going to do. It's in the job description that it will do a lot of that work. But it is the start and initial trial of us having some family liaison support at some of our schools, particularly those that most need it, like the sixth grade school that has a lot of in and out happening. The service, oh, this was reviewed at CIAA and moved forward for the full committee's consideration. Service desk manager was as a reconfiguration of roles in the IT department to oversee some of the folks who are user facing and give them some management support on the service desk. It is budget neutral? Yes. Correct. Yes. And was reviewed in budget subcommittee and move forward for the committee's consideration. And this grant program manager is specific to overseeing a large grant that is tied to mental health initiatives and professional development being offered to our teachers. It is fully funded by that grant. It was reviewed in CIAA subcommittee and is being moved forward for the full committee's consideration.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 41</summary>

> OK. Do I have a motion to approve the job descriptions as presented? So moved. Second. Any discussion of any of the job descriptions? Seeing none, all in favor? Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? OK. So those all pass unanimously.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Consent Agenda</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 94</summary>

> Next, we have the consent agenda. Allitems listed with an asterisk are considered to be routine and will beenacted in one motion. There will be no separate discussion of theseitems unless a member of the committee so requests in which event theitem will be considered as normal sequence. Warrant number 23266,dated 5-16-23, $786,671.06 and the draft of regular school committeemeeting minutes, May 11th, 2020. So it's 2022 but I think to me, it's2023. So, do we have a motion? So moved. Second. Oops, that'sright. Thank you. All in favor? Aye. Aye. Any opposed? Anyabstentions?
</details></details>
<details><summary>Subcommittee/Liaison Reports/Announcements</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 10</summary>

> Next, we have subcommittee and liaison reports. Budget, Mr. Cardin.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Len Karden - 322</summary>

> Do we need since last time? Yeah, we must have met since last meeting, yes. We met, we went over the job description, we and the fees, are those not on the agenda for today? No, we don't have the fees. Oops, we forgot the fees. Sorry. All right, so we approved the fees which will come before us at our next meeting and we went over the summary that we just saw and the slides that we're developing for our meeting with finance committee next week. I expect to squeeze in one more budget meeting before the end of the year to talk about maybe providing a little bit more evidence around some of the needs that we have budget-wise and also talking about whatever else we need to before the end of the year. That will be the budget transfers but. OK. And we also voted to approve the copiers. Oh, right, the copiers, yes, but that's not also. Is that coming? Does that need to be approved now? OK. Yeah. Sorry. May I speak? Sure. Yeah, so. Mr. Mason will present about the copiers. Yes, yes. In NOVIS, you'll see that there's an attachment and just explain the outlay of costs. We chose three vendors on state contracts, solicited quotes from the three contracts, from three vendors. And RICO, we've had an established partnership for them for a double-digit amount of years at this point. They were the lowest but we're seeing that our machines are lasting longer and it is more cost-effective if we do a longer-term lease. And so, in the state of Massachusetts, Chapter 30B requires the school committee to vote to approve any contract that we would award to a vendor that goes beyond three years. So, this is why this is being hopefully that the school committee would move to approve the award of the contract to RICO for a 48-month term. So moved.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 53</summary>

> Second. OK. Any comments? My recollection is that we approved this. We did, yes. Sorry, we recommend approval. So, we did discuss it. OK. At length. No, I'm just kidding. Any? No, that wasn't. OK. So, I don't see any comments. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Any abstentions? No. So, that passes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 5</summary>

> Next, we have community relations.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Liz Exton - 350</summary>

> Thank you. We met on Tuesday evening to discuss the MBTA communities working group who had reached out to Dr. Homan to join a meeting that they are having and she had asked us to give her some feedback on just how, I'm not going to give a good background on what all of this is, but essentially the MBTA communities working group is working on a zoning bylaw that they would propose to town meeting to meet compliance requirements for multi-family housing. And so, Dr. Homan was just asking us for feedback around how that might impact the schools in terms of enrollment and buffer zones and where it might, where in town might be a good place for it, how it might support workforce housing. So, we had a good discussion and we gave Dr. Homan some input and she will take that to the meeting and report back to us. We also talked about the school committee chat schedule for the 23-24 school year. There is some data about attendance over the last two years in Novus. And so, we, and it was just Jeff and I, I should say, poor Laura couldn't make it. We just, we talked about modifying the format a little bit and reducing the schedule and there is a draft also in Novus for you to look over. So, it would be fewer meetings. It was suggested that we include a cabinet team member, predetermined at each of the meetings and then have some focus topics to discuss in an effort to get higher attendance, have questions answered in a more efficient way and always reminding the community members that if they feel like they need to talk to a school committee member without administration, there are other opportunities to do that. But we felt like it would be a healthier discussion that way. So, please do just look at the draft and if you have feedback on it, let us know if we need to have another subcommittee meeting before the end of the year. And I think those are updates.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kirsi Allison Ampe - 144</summary>

> Thank you. Curriculum. Ms. Moore. Before we leave community relations, we had a school committee chat last Saturday. Ms. Gittleson and myself did it. We had a couple of parents. The focus was on English learners. And the biggest question we had, I'll write up the results. I didn't bring my computer with me tonight. But the biggest question that was out there was the formation of an LPAC and folks were wondering, were excited about that and wondering when we're going to get that off the ground. So, communication from the school department to the community about the possible formation of the LPAC would be a positive thing. OK. Next, we have curriculum instruction accountability and assessment accountability. Ms. Morgan was unable to attend today. But is anyone else on the committee and can, is there anything else that we, that was discussed?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 47</summary>

> Sure. So, we went over the goals. We went over the position descriptions. We had an update on HGI from Dr. Janger. He's coming in June, I think, to the full committee. So, there's really nothing to discuss about that. I think that was it, right? Yeah.
</details>

<details><summary>	 Paul Schlichtman - 261</summary>

> OK. And Mr. Shultman? So, it turns out that there's this private way right around the corner from the Thompson School, Regis Road. It used to be a plethora of potholes. Somebody paved it and now we've got people speeding down the street and they're... Which street?  Regis Road. It is adjacent to the northwest corner of the Thompson campus. And there are no traffic control devices there. There's no stop signs, no nothing and now people are speeding out of Regis Road across Everett Street. And one of our parents and a 5-year-old almost got hit by one of these cars while traveling on a bicycle. The parent complained on Facebook, which is where you go to complain about stuff, and I pointed the parents to the select board who has the responsibility for placing stop signs and other such devices around. But because it's right adjacent to our property, I'd like to get traffic safety at the Thompson School as a general topic in the Regis Road corner with Everett Street in specific, to be specific on our next agenda. Hopefully the select board in the interim will take up the mantle and move to put a sign there, but I think that I'd like to have that on the agenda for the next meeting. Okay. I'm trying to think of who would take this on. Okay. Okay. So I'll put you down for it. Okay. Do you have any questions you need clarified about this?  No. If I do, I'll reach out to Mr. Slipman. Yeah.
