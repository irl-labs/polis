</details><details><summary>Detail the Buffer Zone report from the Superintendent.</summary>

> The Buffer Zone report from the Superintendent, Dr. Homan, provided an overview of the implementation and effectiveness of the Buffer Zone policy in maintaining balanced class sizes in Arlington schools. The report showed that the majority of families were able to get their first choice of Buffer Zone assignment, with only a few receiving their second choice, usually due to late registration. The total number of Buffer Zone registrations for the school year was 120, down 10 from the previous year. The report also provided a grade level breakdown for all schools and a class size overview and comparison. The Superintendent suggested that the Buffer Zones have been effective in managing class sizes, particularly during periods of enrollment growth or contraction. However, she also suggested that it might be beneficial to review and potentially adjust the Buffer Zones, particularly for Thompson school which is currently experiencing space constraints.
