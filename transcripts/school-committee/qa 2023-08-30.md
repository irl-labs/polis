</details><details><summary>Please summarize the discussion concerning student handbook.</summary>

> The discussion concerning the student handbooks revolved around several key points. There was a question about the homework policy in the elementary school handbook, as some members thought there was no homework for lower grades. However, it was clarified that there is no consistent practice across the system. There was also a question about the dress code, specifically about how the policy would handle a situation where a student chose to express themselves by wearing very little clothing. The superintendent clarified that such a situation would fall under the category of maintaining an environment that is healthy and free from substantial disruption or harassment. There was also a discussion about the requirement for a doctor's note to excuse absences in the high school handbook, with one member stating they would abstain from approving the handbook due to this requirement. The superintendent agreed to revisit this issue.
