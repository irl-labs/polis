So we can actually start right in with the vote to approve application for rebate for electric bus which is being presented by Ms. Talia Fox from the town and she's on Zoom so we need to be able to see Zoom people. Okay, she knows she's being promoted so she knows she's being promoted on Zoom. Okay, Ms. Fox, can you hear us? Oh, your microphone is muted at least from this side. Ms. Fox? Can you unmute her manually? Nope, there she is. Okay, there we go. Hi there. I can't hear anybody. I can hear you. Can you hear us? You can't hear us, Talia? You can't hear us, Talia? Can you hear us, Talia? Can you hear us, Talia? Okay, got it. Okay. She can hear us now. Okay, I'm going to unmute you. Okay. Okay, I'm going to unmute you. Okay, got it. Okay. She can hear us now. Can you hear us now. Okay.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, we are. Since you missed, we are ready to vote to approve the application for the rebate for electric bus, we could just tell us real quickly what it's about. Also, I'm not yet. But, I'm the school bus rebate program is a federal company initiated by the EPA, and the application requires signing of the form signed by an authorized school district representative, basically acknowledging that the school committee was informed about the application, the number of buses and the fuel type of buses, as well as the number of buses. And I'm planning to apply for funds to support one electric bus, to replace an Eagle bus in the school suite. The school would own the bus. I'm not planning to apply for funding for charging infrastructure, because the school transportation director has informed me that an additional bus would not be sufficient for an electric vehicle, which is why I'm seeking additional funds. The maximum funding amount is $200,000 for the rebate, and we have $150,000 in the FY25 capital budget to replace the diesel bus. This amount would not be sufficient for an electric vehicle, which is why I'm seeking additional funds. Given the talents of the school schools, and what we have here, it's crucial that I speak up for community providers to eliminate the use of fossil fuels and minimize pollution in the community. So, it does feel important to mention that the likelihood of us securing this rebate is quite small. We are not a prioritized community because we don't meet certain environmental justice criteria that the federal government is using to allocate funds. And I'll do my best to seek additional funding sources so that we aren't forced to purchase a diesel bus in the new fiscal year. So, with all that said, I just ask for your blessing for this application. I'm happy to answer any quick questions, but I don't think there's a ton of time right now, and I'm happy to come back to the committee and have a lengthier discussion about some of the climate initiatives that we have going on. And I do plan to come back in the coming weeks. So, thanks.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Elizabeth Homan - 182</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I think so. Yeah. That's what I'd like. While they get set up, I just want to say a few quick words. First of all, a big thank you to Dr. Connolly, who's a new principal in the Arlington Public Schools and stepped in as interim principal at Hardy during a late transition of their principal last year. I want to thank Dr. Connolly for all the work you've done to support the Hardy community this year, especially. Notable is the work that our special educators in the SLCC program have done with some new staff and the support that the community has really gotten from your leadership. Dr. Connolly told us recently she won't be applying to the permanent position. And while we're sad to say goodbye, we're very grateful for her leadership and also for the leadership of Ms. Tassoulas, who has been the assistant principal there for quite a while. I'm excited for them to share some of the great work they have going on at Hardy this year. And I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Connolly.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 M Connolly - 2160</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thanks very much, Dr. Holman. First of all, Dr. Holman, I thank you as well for your support and everyone here at the table's support in my role here. It's been an incredible opportunity in my professional journey. I've learned a tremendous amount, and it's been really nice being back into schools with students. So I've really enjoyed the opportunity. And I'd also like to take the time to thank the educators at the Hardy School. It's just been tremendous to work with them, consummate professionals, and really have students at the center. And as Dr. Holman spoke, the SLC programs at the school have really done well, so I want to thank Allison for her support in our continued efforts to improve those programs and all opportunities for all students. So to everyone at the Hardy School and families, but most in particular the students, who have just really warmed my heart tremendously to be, as I said, back in schools and every day being with students. So it's been a tremendous opportunity. So tonight I just want to talk about the Hardy numbers, our priorities, areas, and then answer any questions that you may have for us. So the Hardy School, our initial vision from 1925 was hand, heart, mind for the common good, and the Hardy community sort of took that on as an initiative last year and has really solidified it this year, working with the students and the families and came up with safe, kind, and responsible, which is really reflective of the work that we do in our goals in our positive behavior programs. So those are really the goals that we work with the students on. Last year we had 383 students and 49 staff. We're up a couple of students and a couple of staff this year, and the staff increase is due to some of our special education needs. The race and ethnicity of Hardy School has remained relatively steady. We have seen a drop in our African-American black population. This is just two years ago, it was 3.2. In part that is due to Boston resident students working closely with the medical director to see if we can't get those numbers up as we'll have just one student that resides in Boston at the Hardy School next year, and we want to certainly at least supply some sort of a cohort for them. The strategic goals were in your packets and they're here. Some will be familiar. I also want to thank my principal colleagues at this time as I'm doing this. They've been an incredible team to me as I've done this work. Not this work here, but just being here in Arlington. It's a really great group of administrators that I've had the privilege of collaborating with. So now we're going to talk about MCAS, and although it's in your report but not on the slides, or the MCAS numbers for mathematics, I just want to talk about those. In aggregate, the data indicate that the Hardy School has met and in some areas exceeded the state determination goals in both achievement and growth. While this is something we take pride in, our instructional leadership team and I hold responsibility to further disaggregate this data, identify students performing below expectations, notably students that are in a high need category. My team and I are responsible for exploring those factors that have contributed to and continue to contribute to considerably lower achievement score for these children compared to the classmates and focus our efforts on closing those gaps through differentiated instructions, interventions, and responsive teaching processes. While 36% of our test takers did not meet grade level expectations, which is certainly a concerning number, 74% did. We must balance our concern for meeting the needs of our high need students in mathematics while ensuring that we implement rigorous and relevant content. I'm going to move to ELA, which is on these slides. And again, as an aggregate data, the Hardy School has met and in some areas have exceeded state determination goals both in achievement and in growth. While this is a positive reflection on the dedicated staff and students of our community, it is my instructional responsibility and that of our instructional leadership team to further disaggregate this data. That said, the data indicate that our high need students earned two of the possible achievement points and six of the possible growth points. And so, therefore, it's a continued area of worry and concern and focus for us. I think another thing that the ILT this year has really been able to do, along with some of the changes that we've made with our weekly meetings, with our ACE meetings, is that every meeting it's an expectation of the team to bring student data to the meetings, and we're looking at that student data and then making recommendations for interventions. We're following the interventions on a weekly basis. Certainly we have six- to eight-week cycles, but on a weekly basis we're talking about what those might look like and how we can make sure that we're doing targeted research-based interventions for all of our students. Part of that, too, is also we're looking to shift our ownership of learning from teacher to the student, which is one of the EL initiatives. And some of these areas that we've really looked at across our whole school is learning targets. As EL refers to them, we would know them more familiar as learning objectives. And total participation techniques, it's sort of a new language that goes along with EL. And those are things that will also be familiar to you. Those are things like turn and talk, a thumb meter, true-false hold-ups, using whiteboards to see, check for understanding, but you're doing it with the whole class at the same time so that then you can get immediate feedback to alter your instruction that's happening. The existing literacy gaps between the high-needs and non-high-needs students continue to be addressed, as I said, through consistent implementation in part by the new EL curriculum and by providing targeted evaluative and non-evaluative instructional feedback for our teachers, as well as, as I said, the targeted interventions and the support of our curriculum coaches. So our next data we're looking at up here is our data on our SEL. We believe that improving belonging for all students is defined and understood as a person, supported by as adults, respected by other students, and having a general feeling of belonging. So we, along with the district, have taken this initiative on full force. One of the significant things that we did was in the beginning of the year, right in the first couple of days of school, Peggy and I put together a whole document and presentation, and we had teachers and custodians and anyone, any of the educators in our building, sign up to be a partner with a student. Some people, not many, but some people chose as many as three, and the job of that person was to make a further connection with that student, whether they're on their way to lunch, they stop in the cafeteria, say hello to them, what they say in the hall, they make a concerted effort to reach out to that student, which I think that has made a big deal. People took this and were very excited about the opportunity. Teachers that had particular students couldn't wait to make those connections, and every student in the school has somebody or even two people that are connected to them. And what we'll do is in a couple of months we will do an event in which those folks will be able to work with those folks outside of the content areas. In addition, we brought back all school meetings, so we have monthly all school meetings in which the fifth grade leaders of our school sort of run the meeting. They read a book that has to do with belonging. We do a birthday pencil handout and a big yell for happy birthday. The Hardy Husky sometimes makes a surprise visit, and we do a whisper Hardy chair that has become beloved and they can't wait to do the whisper, give me an H, Hardy chair. But I think that it's really a credit to the faculty that we went up 12 percentage points in our most recent panorama data on the sense of belonging for our students, and it's just a concerted effort by all the employees of the Hardy School that have made this possible. Strategic family engagement goal, improve the belonging for all families. I think one of the things that I certainly recognized in my career over the last number of days as we went through the collective COVID is that we were slow to get folks back in, both for folks wanting to volunteer and just even feeling some trepidation around allowing folks to come in. So I think that we started this before I came, but this year we've brought back a number of community events. We've done the Harvest Fest, we've had Trunk or Treat, we've had picnics, we've had a craft day. We were going to have a movie night, but it conflicts with basketball, so we're going to put that off a little bit. But there's been a number of things that we've worked in collaboration with the PTO who have also been amazingly supportive of our teachers in the community to bring back that whole idea. The elementary school is such a part of the ethos of the neighborhoods, and having neighborhood schools lends itself to that. One of the things that we've seen is a much more significant outpouring, even in the last short order, of folks wanting to come in and volunteer and be in the library and be readers and even come and say, we'll make copies for you. So it's been really great. I think that the community is now beginning to feel. We have a big event on Tuesday morning for our kindergartners. They're all doing presentations, and they're doing a gallery walk with families. So if you're not doing anything at 9 o'clock on Tuesday morning, you can come on by and see some of the EL work actually in progress. And part of that is them presenting their work, and they're quite articulate, and it's pretty wonderful. In addition, we're in the process of gathering nominations for a school council. We've not had a school council in a little bit. The PTO is helping me with this. We do have a number of folks that are interested, and we're hoping to hold nominations probably right after February break. We're in the process of working on it. One of the things that I've done as well is I've increased my meeting time with the PTO. So aside from just the monthly meeting, I'm holding two additional meetings in the mornings right when school starts, because I just felt like it was important to get their voices. They're so generous with their time and their resources that I felt like it was really important for me as I onboarded, certainly, but I would also suggest that it's been beneficial to the school to have those more frequent meetings. Then our areas of focus, so attendance, belonging, transitions. Attendance continues to be an area of concern for the Hardy School. I think that as we're working with the school nurse, we had eight students leave yesterday with fevers. Nobody tested positive for COVID, and so it's just one of those things. But I also think that at the elementary level, I think that there's a little bit more of a sense that it's okay if someone leaves. It's okay if we take vacation a couple of days early. It's okay if my student, it's going to be okay. They're in elementary school, and so really I feel like it's an opportunity to educate families that when you miss 18 days, it's a tenth of your school year, and it is really critical. I completely understand that it's the need to maybe go away a day earlier, or you have family things that come up, but really it's really important to be in school, particularly just given our most recent history. So we have letters going out. We have communications going out from teachers. We have meetings with families, and so again, I think it's just an opportunity for us to educate folks on how critical it is to get their kids, even their littlest kids, in. And so with that, again, just much appreciation for this last many months. I still have five months, and I'm looking forward to it. It's been great. So just if you have any questions, Peggy and I are happy to answer anything you might have.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to add a little. Dr. Connolly didn't highlight this because it's new data, and Mr. Coleman is going to talk a little bit more about our panorama results, but on the spring panorama survey, Hardy saw a 12-point jump in belonging, and I would credit that directly to some of the initiatives that they've had going on, and a 15-point jump in questions like what kind of support do you get from adults in your school, which can look directly at some of those issues. initiatives she was describing around connecting adults to students so that they have a trusted adult in the school. So kudos to the work that you've done this year. It's already showing some pretty strong results.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Dr. Connolly, thank you for sharing your talent and your experience and caring with us for a year in this interim assignment. The community I'm sure appreciates that and I wish you well as you wander off where wherever you want to be and I hope for a lot of success. Thank you for the thoughtful presentation. I'm curious that taking a look at the growth numbers grade four to grade five. Grade five is blowing the doors off the growth numbers. Grade four isn't particularly over in math. So do you have any sense of why?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 M Connolly - 275</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you know elementary schools are greatly impacted by cohorts and I think that this particular grade was also greatly impacted by COVID and so I think that we've had this when you look when we look at scores not just MCAS scores but other other points of data including our dibbles reading scores over time this group has necessitated and secured significant months of intervention just due to their need and so that continues where it's certainly a focus of us right now. One of the things that we're looking at is you know even as we prepare for MCAS and I mean that loosely but is helping students to become more familiar with the devices that they'll be assessed on right so mathematics is on a computer so we're having students start to work on the computer to do their mathematics in adapting the curriculum to be able to do that a little bit and working with our math coach. So it's somehow sometimes cohorts and particularly in smaller elementary schools they have the you know personality of their own like each school in needs of their own and this has been a focus for this school for since these folks were in COVID and then beyond so it's I can't say that it's all of that I think I'd say that I can't point to COVID and that's the reason why because we have other groups as you said the fifth grade scores and the third grade scores wouldn't don't reflect that but we are certainly aware and are focusing much of our attention on that. So all I need to know.</blockquote>

Ms. Leiner and Ms. Spinney have been the team at Bishop for this school year and a good and a good portion of last school year if you'll recall Ms. Leiner stepped in as interim principal last school year about mid-year. Ms. Spinney came back to join us after being the AP at Stratton for a little while and I just want to point out some great work that's been done at Bishop improving meeting structures conducting meaningful full professional development and very purposefully planned professional development as part of their building meetings this school year. Ms. Leiner was integral in the rollout of a PBIS process at one she was the assistant principal there and I know that that's ongoing into the school year. It's always a wonderful community to visit with a very vibrant and involved parent community and I look forward to hearing what they have to share with us tonight what they've been up to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much appreciate it and thank you all for having us here tonight we appreciate being here and we're looking forward to discussing the accomplishments and school priorities. I feel very fortunate to be the principal of the Bishop school and would like to introduce a few people who have joined me here tonight this is Erin Spinney our assistant principal who you'll hear from in a moment. I also have Maria Mato here she is our literacy coach and Emily Beder our math coach and in the back Mary Perry who is our PTO president and is also one of our community members on our PBIS team. So thank you for having us all here tonight. So tonight we'll be highlighting some of Bishop's data from last year. We will also be stating our school improvement goals discussing some of our important priorities for this year and looking ahead to Bishop's future for the next few years. To start with Bishop is a wonderful school with just under 400 students and over 60 staff members and a proud Metco school. I started at Bishop school as Dr. Holman said as the first assistant principal five years ago and last year I became the interim principal in November. As far as initiating any new priorities last year that really wasn't my role as interim principal. My goals were to ensure that students and staff felt a sense of security and that the previous principals priorities were supported. As I said many times I wanted to make sure that the ship kept sailing in the right direction and with such a supportive and strong staff and caring community of families we did just that. So to look at some of the data this slide shows our student enrollment demographics. While most of our demographic data percentages are just slightly smaller than the district's the Bishop community has representation from many different countries with 15% of our students with their language first language not English. Our ML population is nearly twice that of the district's. Last year we gained an additional ML teacher which has been pivotal in really supporting our growing ML population. Over the summer we asked our families which you can see the picture in the middle we ask our families to tell us their countries of origin and we made a display of the flags of all the countries that represent the many families that responded. We have 67 flags displayed currently and we will continue to ask families each year to update our display as needed. So the next slide goes into our MCAS data. I am very proud of the Bishop's data I will say. Our MCAS scores last year showed great growth and achievement. Our accountability rating was 96% which indicates that 91% of our students met or exceeded the standard in grades three to five. I attribute this excellent score to the high quality instruction of outstanding educators who are delivering instruction each day. Our coaching model, these two, that support instructional practices in the classroom and help to give teachers tools that they can use with children in the classroom. We have quality paraprofessionals who support individual students every single day in the classrooms and a rigorous RTI process that helps to find out and support the individual needs of students who may be struggling. And lastly and probably most importantly we have supportive families that work very closely with the schools. So we're looking forward to see how our new ELA curriculum will affect our ELA scores particularly for our high needs population with the, you know, upcoming rollout. So this slide, it was interesting to be able to look at some cohort data. So this takes a closer look at our math MCAS data and looks how fifth graders from last year did over the past three years. So the scores, the scores themselves are grouped by grade level. So by looking at the 2021 third grade data, 2022 fourth grade data, and then the 2023 fifth grade data, you can look at the cohort of students to observe how the gap between non high needs and high needs students changed over three years. So I'm very pleased to share with a very focused effort that the gap decreased from 15 to 6 to 2 percent over the three years at Bishop with that particular group of students. Because of the pandemic, we don't have other cohort data to look at, but we will sort of continue to look at these type of trends with particular groups of students in the coming years. So now Ms. Finney is going to speak about our school improvement goals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first goal will address the achievement gap in literacy between high needs and non high needs students. We're really excited about implementing the new curriculum. We found that the former curriculum left a little to be desired when it came to our students with high needs. EL is more inclusive and allows for more discussion among students, which increases their deeper understanding. Not only are we implementing foundations integrity in the classroom, but our tier one, tier two, and tier three instructors are giving students a double dose when appropriate, which not only furthers their understanding, but makes them feel more comfortable to participate in the classroom. Our next goal, this next goal, we will be focusing on increasing tier one instruction and student engagement by implementing EL, high level instructional practices across the curriculum. We have focused on this within our instructional leadership team. Our members are taking risks in implementing new protocols. They are welcoming their peers to come in and observe lessons in their classroom, which you know allows for opening themselves up to feedback, and I have to say I've really been impressed with the Bishop School. We have new or newer teachers to Bishop that are excited about jumping in to something new, and they're taking some risks, but we also have many of our seasoned teachers diving into new protocols and promoting academic discourse, not only in ELA, but in all the curricular areas, which is really impressive to see. Our third goal is focusing on culture and climate, and we will be working to improve belonging for all students. Again, through our instructional leadership team, we are working with the director of the DEIBJ, Margaret Creedle Thomas, to learn how to appropriately and effectively conduct empathy interviews in hopes to gather more information about how to improve belonging for all students. This last goal is all about improving belonging for all families. We are taking more steps to reach out to families and about their child's academic progress, and trying to establish stronger communication channels, and Mrs. Leiner will be talking more about this shortly. All right, I'm sure those goals looked very familiar to you now that we've had many elementary schools come through. We, as stated, we've worked together on those, and it was a very great process. So, as far as academic and instructional priorities, as you've likely heard from my colleagues in the other elementary schools, one of our priorities is continue to look closely at our early literacy data, including Dibble Screener, to identify students who need more intensive Tier 1 and Tier 2 supports. We use time in our weekly meetings to discuss the most effective interventions, leaning on our reading department and instructional literacy coach, and then our classroom teachers and reading teachers do an outstanding job in the large group instruction and giving students exactly what they need to support their areas of growth. Our displayed Dibble's data demonstrates the effectiveness of our literacy programming and decreasing the number of students who are below and well below the standard after kindergarten. Another priority connected to this, sorry, another priority connected to this goal is to increase our protocols and academic discourse strategies. As teachers learn more tools, they are getting more comfortable utilizing these highly engaging practices and are seeing important results in the student work. For example, last year at a summative meeting that I had with a teacher, she mentioned that her students' written essays were better than in previous years. I asked her why she thought there was a change and she attributed the growth, the growth in her students to her growing use of discourse, particularly around pre-writing and particularly with her high-needs students. So when having more time to discuss their ideas and importantly hear other classmates' ideas, they were all better able to express their thoughts in writing. So my hope is that when we fully implement the EL curriculum, which is rich in discourse, we will continue to see this level of improvement in written expression. So as far as the culture and climate priorities, in an effort to increase student belonging, particularly for those students in our focal groups, coupled with the fact that there have been leadership changes over the past year, Ms. Binney and I worked with Margaret Creedle-Thomas and Magali Olander, the SEL director, to create a PD series around building trust, building belonging, and making connections with our work with students and families. This three-session PD is just the beginning of what I hope to be a multi-year series. This is not the kind of work that's ever done, so we will continue to collaboratively plan to build on our learning each year. Additionally, as Ms. Binney mentioned earlier, our ILT is getting empathy interview training to be able to skillfully conduct empathy interviews with selected students and families. Our hope is to analyze the data in a longitudinal study where we are asking the same students and families questions over a number of years, and we'll use this data in addition to other qualitative data like the panorama survey to better understand their experiences and make important adjustments to our programming as needed. And lastly, in this priority area, as Dr. Holman mentioned, we will continue our thriving PBIS system. We have clear school-wide behavioral expectations that teachers reinforce in their classroom, and a very thriving acknowledgement system where students earn blue Bishop Bear tickets for demonstrating one of our three core values, respect, responsibility, or regard for others. We have clear signage through the school and have different all-school activities and challenges, like earning a certain number of tickets in a category like regard in order to earn all-school pajama day, or having a teacher march madness bracket to acknowledge the participation of our excellent staff. One piece of panorama data that's kind of small on that slide in the area of school climate was how positive or negative is the energy in your school, and we had an increase in that last year, and I believe one of the reasons we made gains in the area is because we had a full year experience of PBIS last year for the first time. So the last priority is family engagement, and Bishop has rich traditions and family events that are a huge part of what makes Bishop a special school, and I have hugely appreciated the collaboration and supportive spirit of our PTO in the past, and even more recently as I transitioned to be principal. Increasing participation in the many events like the Bishop play, bear fairs, science night, and the cultural fest is one of the important tasks that we have ahead. We're also looking to add more family engagement activities, like the principal's meet and greets that Miss Benny and I have started this year, and a math event for families that's currently being planned. Additionally, since the pandemic, there really has not been a concerted effort to address chronic absenteeism, so this year Miss Benny and I, in collaboration with classroom teachers, are in greater communication with families around excessive absences and are committed to raising awareness and working with families to move forward with this work. I will also collaborate with my principal and assistant principal colleagues to learn more about effective mechanisms that they've used to increase attendance. So the last slide is around just Bishop's future. So there are a few things I wanted to highlight from this, but some of the areas we plan to build upon in the next few years. We're looking to increase our social work in the building to be more in line with the other elementary schools, so that we can provide tier one and tier two supports for children. We want to continue our equity PD work with our staff. We need to focus greatly on the ways we can support staff and the EL implementation through ACE meetings and other PD time. Looking to add new technology, like audio systems in the classroom, to bring up our technology to be in par with newer schools, newer than Bishop, or more newly renovated than Bishop, and also to have more interdisciplinary and innovative experiences for children by increasing our gardening program. So I appreciate your attention and listening to our presentation, and if you have any questions we're happy to talk about Bishop more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, and sort of relates to Hardy as well. Thank you for ramping up community engagement and involvement of families. How are people reacting to that? Are you getting good attendance at these events? Yes, some of the events are brand new, and so it's hard to gauge whether or not. So as I said, Ms. Binning and I have had principal meet and greets. We never had that before when I was an assistant principal, so it's hard to gauge. but I will say they've been consistently attended by different families so it's not that the same people are coming every time so that's been positive and some of the new events that we have are upcoming so I'll be able to report more on that later. Great, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, I mean you've got the same fourth, fifth grade thing working too. I'm wondering if there's something systemic about our curriculum or something going on around the district or is this just sort of a quirk that the two of you guys are encountering the same little growth number? I'm gonna chime in on his question because I was gonna ask the same thing and actually I wonder if it's because of COVID, because of the age. That's what I was going to address. Yeah, so the students who, so we're talking about the students who were in fourth grade last year in Iraq, so our current fifth graders, were in first, second grade, some of the real foundational times particularly for literacy and I think we can all agree that COVID was unprecedented. We didn't always have all the, you know, proper supports in place in that sort of remote and hybrid setting so I would attribute a lot of that. I think my colleague had mentioned that as well. Yeah, I don't, I mean any one of my team can chime in on any other thoughts around a discrepancy. I mean it's just sort of interesting in, but with the knowledge that every kid who was a fifth grader last year was in the same cohort and ran through the same thing. So yeah. You know, and I want to underline that I'm not concerned because you're hitting a 96 percentile score which means you're knocking the score, the scores out of the park. And to have high achieving, high growth kids like Bishop obviously does, is a wonderful thing. That said, you come in here doing wonderful things. I want to extract that and spread it around the district. Right, so the other thing that I just thought of prior to you speaking was that that, that our current fifth grade group is a large class. So our school has three sections per grade. That grade has four and I believe that that large trend is across the district in our fifth grade. Good luck to Gibbs when they all come next year. And so I do think there's also, there's a little bit of numbers in that too that we have more in that cohort. And at the end of your report you were talking about all these needs for professional development. You're working very hard in professional development and I admire you and your staff for wanting to go in that direction. Do you have enough time? Do you have enough ability? I don't want to see you guys get buried in all the enthusiasm and just sort of burn out either. I think that there's always the balance, right? So there's a lot of things that need to get done, particularly with a new curriculum being rolled out as well to the full school next year. So it's going to be about balancing all those priorities and keeping in really great communication with our coaches and our teachers to make sure that what we're doing is matching what they're needing and making adjustments as needed. But some of the equity work is just work that we have to continue to do. So we have to prioritize in some way. You're speaking well for your school in the district. Thanks for your presentation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks very much for both presentations. Both schools talked about attendance and I'm just wondering when you talk to individual students and their families about attendance issues without getting into a specific case, what are you kind of, what are you hearing from them? It's, there's so many different reasons for excessive absences. There's medical issues, there's traveling. As I said, we have a number of families who are international and, you know, if you travel to India, you're not going for a long weekend, right? You're going to be gone for a few weeks. And so between, you know, every situation is a bit unique and I think that part of our work this year is to have those conversations and start gaining that understanding of, okay, what's going on with all our families and then we can start really catering the needs. It, truly at an elementary level, it's, it's, it's a fan, absenteeism is a family thing, right? Kids, kids get driven to school or they walk to school with their families. So we don't really speak with kids about absenteeism as much as with parents.</blockquote>

Okay, I'm gonna circle back to the current fifth graders and this isn't so much for you but rather more for the district that just the little bits of data that we've been seeing just tonight suggest that those kids are still behind or at least certainly the high needs kids in that cohort are behind and I'm just hoping that as we go, as they all go to Gibbs, that we're ready for them and we need to continue closing those gaps because that's concerning. No matter what the source is, you know, we have to be working towards getting them up to speed, the same speed that everyone else is going. So thank you very much. I appreciate your presentation.</blockquote>

So next we have the AHS program of study. Dr. Ganger, want me to change? Mr. McCarthy. Yeah, can you hit escape? The program of studies is on this computer if you wanted to pull it up. Do you want me to open it? You can leave it right there. Is that it? Yeah, that's it. Leave it that way. If you need to scroll through it, you can.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Matthew Janger - 628</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you all. How's everyone doing tonight? Well, it's that time of year again. Program of studies time. We saw, I saw Dr. Ganger here earlier. Is he gone now? So as you can see, we have the program of studies here. I believe it was sent out to everyone. Quick structural piece just before we get into any of the updates for this next year. The opening page, if you notice at the bottom of the opening page, it says updates specific to 2024 and 2025. That lists all of our new courses, course changes, and so that is helpful as a link. I believe that was all shared with everyone and that's what I'm going to be working from right now. Also the table of contents, and this is for anyone who is listening, everything here is bookmarked and linked so that's really going to be your home page when you're trying to explore different departments and different course materials and policies. So I'm going to run through the updates and new courses. If there are questions, I'm obviously open to them. Policy and general information updates. So the first one you'll see there is a department name change. So originally our English learner education department will be changing their name to the multi-language learner education and that is obviously to foster the fact that many of our students are learning multiple languages or have already mastered several languages. To match that change, we will be taking several of the courses which are currently listed as WIDA 1, WIDA 2, and we'll be changing their numbers and their titles. That's included in the chart below and I'll point that out as we get there. Grade scale update. So the grade scale, this is not a change to the title of the grades, but the original wording in our grade scale was along the lines of exceeds standard, proficient work, fair work, poor work, and failure. Talking as a team, including teachers, we've decided that exceeds standard, meets standard, partially meets standard, minimally meets standard, and does not meet standard is more in line with our curriculum and how we are promoting our students. The next section what we are removing is the design thinking certificate and global competency certificate. You might remember we introduced these several years back as a way to bring in different pieces to our curriculum in our school for our students to access. Most of the materials that are in these certificates have been rolled into the courses at this stage. So design thinking certificate with the expansion of the makerspace, metalworking, design and fabrication, most of what they ask for in that are folded into the courses themselves now. Same with global competency certificate. As we've worked those materials, our original goal was to offer that and work those materials into the curriculum and we have now done that. The last one is one that we're very excited about, and this is a change to a course, but Latin 5. As you may remember there are three levels. There's AP Latin, Latin 5 Honors, and Latin 5 Curriculum A. We are now going to be partnering with UMass Boston in much the same way we've done with Syracuse in the past, and we still have those programs with Syracuse as well. We call those SUPA. We'll be partnering with UMass Boston and students that complete Latin 5 and pay the nominal fee will actually have a UMass Boston transcript that states that they finished Latin 5. So we'll get credit through Arlington High School and they will get credit through UMass Boston. We're very excited about that change and that connection with UMass. Any questions on the policy or general information?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll keep rolling. Honestly, I just want to say, Bill really pulls this all together. So I'm really, perfectly happy for the both of you. Run through all of it. So, new courses. So the new courses that we have, most of them are just advancing the curriculum we've already offered. Filmmaking, architecture, animation, you'll remember last year we revamped the visual arts department to take advantage of the new space. This is just taking those students that have finished part one and part two and opening up part three so they can continue their work. Design, engineering, and fabrication. We're looking forward to this course where we are going to be doing virtual designs and a change to this will be actually bringing them to the maker space and designing and building the items, whether that's in wood, metal, plastic with the 3D printers, and we're hoping that will continue to grow. This is starts at a level one. It does offer a level two right now and our hope is that much the same way we do with the other departments classes, they'll continue to grow. As far as the other courses, most of them actually previously existed. We are just finding new ways to, as we did them this year, you'll notice courses like play building and directing and advanced scene study and improvisation are all courses we offered this year. As we taught through them, we decided that there are ways to meld these courses together and they actually fit well in terms of the curriculum. So our goal there is to bring these courses together and really play directing, play building and directing are two courses that meld well and really build on the same skill set. Much the same way with improvisation and scene study. There are several courses that are going to be put on the, reactivated. Most of those focus around science and our computer science department. And again, I think we do rotate through these courses on a yearly basis. So as we reactivate astronomy, we will be deactivating weather and climate. We'll be reactivating artificial intelligence, which if any of you have walked through the building, you've seen the drone flying around. We have a student who is building an AI for a drone. It's a lot of fun, a little scary at times. And so that rotation will continue on. There are several courses we're retiring. Most of those you'll see are actually just being enveloped by other courses. So we're not cutting back on anything. We're just finding new ways to have students access that material. And that is that. Did I miss anything? Very short process. Our goal, next steps, is obviously hear any questions, go through the process. Our goal is to open up the course selection in February and then we'll have an idea of which courses will run and which courses will not run in March. And obviously that influences our staffing as well. Just because I feel I need to justify sitting here, I mean the philosophy by which we sort of create these new courses, right, there's new opportunities created by the new building. There's new areas of interest expressed by students. And then sometimes we're looking to sort of serve or bring in populations of students. And then sometimes we're taking courses and sort of reconfiguring them to more accurately reflect what it is they're doing. So an example of bringing in new students, which wasn't mentioned, for example, is the pep band drum line, right, because we have a lot of students who are historically musicians, right, and they come up through the system. But there are kids who would like to learn to play a drum or might play other things. And so starting to create that opportunity, but to bring music into the community and bring another group of students into the performing arts, would just be one example of that type of thing. Any questions, comments?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all very thoughtful and, you know, having sat through this for a bunch of years, that I can see the logical progression in what you're doing. It makes a lot of sense and I'm glad you're taking advantage of the new building. The one thing I want to just sort of ask for a little more depth is the grade scale updates, because I think this is magnificent. I really, really admire you and like the change in wording. In conjunction with that, can you describe how teachers are rethinking their grading and how they're describing grading requirements to students? Because it would seem, it seems there's a mind shift going on here. So we have been working for a while, right?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Matthew Janger - 341</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you go actually to the program of studies and look at the whole description of the grades, the rest of the language, right, has been focusing on trying to have grades be more around three sort of core areas of standards. Content knowledge, complex reasoning skills, and work habits. And by work habits we mean scholarly behaviors. There's a lot of ways people talk about that. And so there's a lot of conversation about trying to make sure that your grades are aligning with those things. One of the things that we took out a long time ago is a lot of the qualitative things, but to keep sort of consistent with how people used to be thinking about it, there was still this idea of good, fair, and poor, right? And the more people have been talking about that, the more of that never comes up. It's not really the way we're characterizing it. It's not fair work, it's students haven't met the standard, right? Which is the same kind of thinking when you say, it wasn't yet. When a student hasn't met the standard, it's not poor work, it's just not yet. Right? And that's really the way we want people to be thinking about it. And that's the conversation we're always having. So to go one step further in depth, I know that when I taught high school, which was sometime in the last century, there was always this tendency of giving a bunch of grades, averaging it up, and using that to do the sort for the grade so that an 82 would be a B minus maybe, depending on the school. So that if you're talking about a standard that if a child or student doesn't encounter the standard when an assessment is made earlier in the year, but then later on demonstrates meeting that standard, do we go back and adjust how we're grading the student or does a earlier non-standard grade sort of hold in the mix somehow? You understand what I'm saying?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 31</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I do understand. I mean, so what you were talking about, I mean, sort of philosophically as a full standards-based approach is sort of spiraling forward and will come back.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Matthew Janger and ? - 559</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are various different ways to do that. Teacher practices right now are not idiosyncratic to the teachers, but they vary in terms of within grade-alike classes, right? So I have a research in biology is more aligned. There are some folks who are doing very full-fledged versions of a standard base. There are others who are doing more of what you just call standard reference. So you are making sure that you're referencing, that the assignments are assessing those standards, that you're not simply saying, I gave you 100 pieces of equivalent work and if you did 80 of them, you got a B minus. Instead, it's like, if you're supposed to know how to speak, I've given you an opportunity to demonstrate that you know how to do speeches. If you're supposed to write this sort of an essay, I've given you an opportunity to demonstrate that you're doing it at this level and an opportunity to make things up. So you'll see in a lot of classes, a lot of math classes, there's a pretty standard test we take, corrections to make sure, because the other thing that used to happen in that way you were talking before, was I take the test, I don't get the grade, and I'm done. I never learned that thing. I move on to the next thing and I don't get the grade. And the thing is, we want to make sure the students have learned it. So they take the test. If they don't master the content, there's a retake. There's an opportunity to make sure that the students have mastered the content. So I think that's a lot of what you're talking about. Exactly. That's exactly what I'm thinking about, is that if you do end up playing nicely with parallel transversals, say, where you didn't get it the first time around, but you become an absolute master of it by the time you're done with the geometry course, that will be reflected in in your grade and your assessment. Yes. Okay. Other questions, comments? I'd like to hear more about the pep band. I know you mentioned it briefly, but it was not adequate for me. I would like to hear more about the pep band. I mean, the idea. I'm fine with hearing the idea, that's also fine. If we get students who are interested, this by the way has been a 10 year journey, we have made efforts at this in the past, but having sort of really the opportunity right now and the staffing to do it. But the idea is that if we have students who are interested, it would particularly focus on percussion. And I'm now gonna not sound like a musician here. I do play all five chords on the guitar, so I got that. The instruments are all listed in the program of studies. But the idea would be that it's focused mainly on percussion. The idea would be to learn how to do that sort of creating an environment at games and other activities and programs. And so as much as I love the symphony orchestra, they don't do well in football games. And so trying to have that spirit building both for students and not bringing music into the space is something we're excited about. Cool, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, everyone. Thanks for having me back. So this presentation, just over the next bunch of slides here, just to keep in mind, one of the things that we're working to do for this particular time is really give a 30,000 foot view of a lot of the results for the fall administration of the survey. Overall success, and I'll talk about some of those little aspects of it. Just a quick little agenda, some of the bigger, broader topics that we'll be talking about. First, just wanted to talk about Panorama as a program. What is it? I'm not quite sure if we all have an understanding of where this survey tool has come about. We'll talk about some survey insights. And when we talk about those, just, again, 30,000 foot view, and there's gonna be a lot of connections to the vision, the mission, and also the strategic plan. We'll talk about the reasons why, but we'll talk about those. And then at the end, we're gonna talk about some of the action steps, not everything, and I'll discuss that throughout the presentation, simply because of the fact that if this is connected to a lot of the strategic plan and the school improvement plans, a lot of this is also gonna be, for my particular role, is supporting a lot of the buildings and making sure that they understand the implications of some of these data, and understanding what could be gleaned from their school improvement plans, and also other things that we might find as areas of focus. So general quick little overview. I put a couple slides at the beginning. An important aspect when thinking about data is ensuring that we're surveying and we're finding data that's actually connected to things and characteristics that we valued. I don't wanna be part of just giving surveys for the sake of being surveys. Even the construction of the panorama survey for the multiple stakeholder groups has pretty clear connections. So in the vision statement, just bolded words and bolded phrases that are gonna be a recurring theme in what we're gonna be talking about. This idea of sense of belonging. There are aspects of the survey in which we talk about this. The idea of growth and joy. There are aspects of the survey we'll talk about this. This idea of empowerment and being engaged in your content areas and curriculum, that's gonna be part of what we'll talk about. When I first started off in supporting this administration, it was important to also find connections to the strategic plan and work with different directors to find areas where their work tied to the survey results. These are three goals. By no means do I wanna say that these are the only goals that the panorama survey results could impact, but these were three in which they were highly impactful to many of the directors and a lot of the school improvement plans. And again, I just took the time to bold some of the words just as we're reading through. These are gonna be recurring themes for what we'll try to look for inside of the survey results. Again, today's gonna be a 30,000 foot view. Not gonna dig into any particular school, but these are clear areas where when we're looking at the results and we're thinking about this story, this narrative that's being told, these are these characteristics and qualities in which we were able to see either growth or some areas of improvement that we can go forward with. One aspect though, just cause I always feel like this part's important to clarify, we do have the ability to sort in the panorama survey for different focal groups. An important aspect of that strategic plan was the identification of certain focal groups where we may want to focus a little bit more. For today, we're not gonna focus in on those, but I just wanted to kind of talk about the fact that throughout my support, throughout some of the session that we'd had this past week with administrators, this idea of digging into a lot of the specifics, more of the questions, and also for some of our groups of students in which we'd want to be a little bit more intentional, that is part of what we've been working on. Not to say it again, but today, 30,000 foot view. We won't get into a lot of the details, but this is an important part in which this survey can play a pretty important role to better understand the experiences and the impacts our educational system has on certain student groups. I'm gonna pivot now just to talk about this survey and talk about one of the reasons why for folks like myself and some of the other administrators, we see some value on this. Panorama is an education-centered group. I've appreciated the team that I've worked with at Panorama. I have an engineer that I work with directly. I have other reps that really are supportive to the questions that I have. Honestly, they get back to me right away. They're open to all the weird queries and questions that I might have. They've really been good to work with. They understand the education setting. They know areas that they need to improve a lot of the times before I even bring them up. And for myself, it's been great to work with them this first time that I've been helping to support the administration. They do have a pretty extensive suite of resources within their tools. It's been a pretty easy lift so far to get this off the ground. A lot of learning, but a good experience overall in working with them. The fact that they are so broad is great. Just quickly bring up a quick little conversation I had with Dr. Janger this past week. For him, when he's thinking about these results, sometimes it's hard for him to consider how these results compare to the elementary schools because the populations might be so different. But the fact that some of these questions and some of these groups of questions are nationally normed against a lot of other schools gives him other ways in which he can compare how we're doing. There's a lot of sortability and flexibility within the platform, which I also appreciate this idea of just large numbers and other samples that may have better representations to the different groups that we're thinking about as well. So it's been easy to work with. I feel pretty good about a lot of the aspects. Doesn't mean that we've perfected it, but it's been pretty good so far for this administration. We have flexibilities in thinking about the types of questions that we ask, either individual questions or in groups of questions. Right now, the way we've set this up is in groups of questions. So for families, those are the seven, eight, my eyes are going a little bad right now, seven different categories. We actually ask all the categories that can be possibly asked for families. We've done that intentionally. Right now, we're still trying to get an understanding of a lot of these different aspects across the board. We ask these questions, these groups of questions to our grades three through 12 students. You'll see a little bit more, but just to kind of add on this detail right now, these questions are grouped by three through five similar questions, and then six through 12 similar questions. Right now, and this will be an important part towards the end, right now, we ask questions of the students about the school and about the classroom. So when you think about these categories, they're answering based on their experiences with the school, answering based on the experience of the classroom. We do have the ability to ask students about their experiences for themselves. We don't ask those students about themselves questions yet, and we are thinking about what that might mean, and I'll talk a little about that towards the end. For staff, this is the wonkiest one for us. Over the past two to three years, because we've shifted some of the groups of questions, and you'll see this in a little bit as well, we panorama-divided certain aspects of the grouping of the teachers and staff. We asked the fewest set of questions for staff. These questions are relevant to what we're looking at, but because we have shifted so much over the past couple of years, it's really hard for us to look at trend data, just because what we're asking has changed. So you'll see in this presentation, I'm pretty light on the info and staff. That's not to mean that the info wasn't good. It's just that from a 30,000 foot view, it's been a little bit more of a challenge for us to get really clear takeaways. From the school level, in each of the buildings, they will, to give them a little bit more information, but we're in the position right now for staff, we just had a lot more variability in the way in which we structured it. Our intention, though, is to keep, for the sake of trend and the sake of thinking about growth, our intention is to keep as much of this consistent for our spring administration, with tweaks that are easy tweaks that are not gonna impact what our overall results are, with the idea that hopefully in future administrations, we can get a little bit more of a consistent view of this. I'm just gonna put all three up. We always have wins, so to speak. There's a lot of good information to take away from the survey, but the one aspect that I was pretty psyched about is this was by far and away our most successful year, if the metric was participation. And I really have to thank a lot of folks for this, Wes and the communication team, the principals, just the ability to get this survey out there, just this ability to make sure it was available for all. So many people did great work. Overall, out of the 11,000 people, students, family members, and staff that we surveyed, we had 62% respond, which was probably about 15 percentage points higher than at any point ever, which was absolutely great. I think Dr. Holman said maybe 66% next time. We'll see if we can do that. Yeah, we'll see. So it's been great from that point of view. It makes me feel a lot more comfortable with the results, knowing the fact that it's just a higher volume. There were some years where, and this is more towards the beginning, where we may have only had like 52 people respond in a certain category, and now it's on the scale of like, hey, 800 people responded in that. So it just makes us feel a little bit more comfortable and confident that we're getting a better canvas of how people feel. All right, so this is one of the views. You probably saw little pieces of these types of reports cut up in different school improvement plans and presentations. I think we saw some of this today. This is just the trend for those different categories for our grade three through five students and where they were. This doesn't give you the overall trend. It's just the prior administration, which for students was last spring, spring 23. And yeah, this is how we did. I'm gonna talk more detail in those in a little bit. Even though some look like they went down or some went up, there are different areas where, based on the overall trend, they're more interesting than others. Here's a snapshot of how grades six through 12 did. One I do wanna point out here though, and we'll talk about this in more detail, is that for six through 12 students, the sense of belonging. I know that's been a recurring theme, and it was brought up a little bit in another snapshot for a school. Nice area of growth there. Family school relations. We'll talk about these results. I just wanted to point out one aspect on the right. For the buckets on learning behavior and school safety, these were two core buckets when looked at in totality. Other questions we could look at if it's offered. That's the national benchmarking. So you can see learning behavior's fantastic. We went up one, but overall compared to other districts nationally, we are still, I think the way it said was 11th percentile. School safety, same thing. We're not only getting our internal metrics that went down two, but even with those scores, we're around the 50th percentile of all schools. So these reports are fantastic just to get a quick little sense, but warrants a lot more digging in. One last one. Nope, no, that was the last one. I alluded to it a little while ago. What we did this past Monday for two hours, and I'm grateful for the time for Dr. Ford-Walker to give up on an admin meeting. We were able to get a bunch of curriculum directors and a bunch of principals, and what we did was our first initial really deep dive into it, which really talked about how to navigate the survey platform, how to think about these reports, and we were able to support them with different protocols where the hope is they're gonna take these types of processes back to the ILTs, consider and reflect upon the school improvement plans, use this as a benchmark right now relative to or with respect to their goals that they've been created, and think about minor tweaks or little things that would have to shift for the remainder of the year to maybe see a little bit more of a positive impact that we're looking for. So what I'm gonna do now to pivot is kind of just tell a story of the things that I noticed, things that I don't wanna say seem contradictory at time, but just kind of talk through some of that high-level data in a quick little story. So here were different things. We have been focusing on the sense of belonging, and it's improving. It's improving across the board. I've been very happy to see that. Student family member perception, though, of cultural awareness and action is declining, which at first to me was a little anti-intuitive, that belonging is increasing in a great way, but a certain aspect of where we might be focusing our work didn't show growth. The teacher-student relationships at six through 12 is improving and remaining really steady. The perception of the school climate for students has been improving, but for family members, the perception of the school climate has been declining, and that's been a little bit anti-intuitive. It's one of those things where it's showing a little bit that students are feeling more positive about their experiences than families might be feeling about their students' experiences. Students' perception of rigorous expectations remain steady. In some areas, that's going up, and I'll talk about this, but not to bury the lead. The area of discourse was an area of growth for a lot of places, and it improved here, but the family members' perceptions of the learning behaviors remain below expectations. That was that category where nationally we're around 11%, that's zero to 19%, so although we're showing improvement, there still might be, from the parents' point of view, areas of growth and improvement. And finally, this one, I don't wanna say that this is a main core reason, and I know a lot of the schools are talking about it. The idea that the family members' perception of the school-based communication might be changing a little bit, and it has a little bit of a decline. So thinking about what's happening in some of these areas and thinking about where we might be able to improve. So let's dig into some of the data. One thing I did for each of these slides, if you look at the bottom, there are questions. I didn't want to include all the questions that are asked, but I included questions that seem to be pretty relevant to the impact on this data. So the sense of belonging, how well do people in your school understand you as a person? How much do you matter to others? How connected do you feel? It's great to see that this is improving, and it's improving pretty consistently. For our grades six through 12 students, that's a fairly good increase. I was psyched to see that. For our cultural awareness and action, this is a chunking of all three, even the family members included. Although we are seeing that nice improvement, we have an area right now with the cultural awareness and some of the conversations that we could have here where I think we probably could have some areas of growth. Talking about speaking out against racism. Little Pockets, a little, the PD that Margaret is working on for Bishop, those things are great. It's awesome that those are already in place and those are moving forward in order to keep these conversations going. This is for six through 12, thinking about the cultural awareness and action. A lot of these questions center on conversations with the community, and I think that's a good thing. on race, how often are they occurring within schools? Teacher-student relationships, though, are improving. Teachers being respectful towards you. Teachers are excited to have you again in the future. That interpersonal relationship, making sure you have a trusted adult, we're seeing a lot of signs of improvement here. This was that question on school climate. So we have this weird nuance where essentially students are feeling really good about their connections with the adults. We see here the perceptions of overall social learning in the school for the students is improving, but the parental pressure, the community perception of it, right now is showing a little bit of a dip. I did want to note, though, that it's still higher than the other two groups in terms of the favorable rating, but it's this weird nuance right now where it almost seems like there's a disconnect with how students feel about their school experience and how others might be perceiving it. This kind of added on to that in terms of the rigorous expectations. These two categories are really high relative to a lot of other samples. The area that was the biggest growth was the explaining the answers, the discourse portions of it. This has shown really, really steady growth with high overall scores the past few years. This is pretty much the trend right now for 6-12. This one seems like a really nice connection overall because we have, I know you've probably heard a lot of school improvement plans that are talking about the concept of discourse, talking about the concept of ensuring that students have voice. It's great to see that is being represented here. This is the learning behaviors. Although this is something that nationally is below, these were two core questions that were of interest. How often does your child read for fun, and how motivated is your child to learn the topics covered in class? I included this one because we are seeing growth, but it does feel like there's still a little bit of a disconnect. These were the national scores for that learning behavior. This one puts us near the 10th percentile. Again, we're seeing growth in those areas, that belief of how school is for our students and our children, but we definitely have some areas of growth. This one was a surprise. I spent a lot of time with this. This is the family school communication. Specifically, just to iron out this one, this is representative much more about how an individual school is working with their community. Right now, across the board, for us as a district where we're looking at a 30,000-foot view, it is decreasing a little bit. It's gone down. Definitely an area in which we're going to dig into and try to understand. I know there's a lot of connections to school improvement plans, which is great, and hopefully some of this can be cleaned up a little bit, but this was one little area. I do want to note on this one that the area where we saw the biggest drop, the question we saw the biggest drop on, was how clear we've been about COVID-related safety measures and protocols, which we don't really communicate about anymore. It's possible that with the removal of that question in that category, at some point, that this could see a nice little uptick again. Right now, just in terms of how we're moving for the next step, and these are the type of things I appreciate Dr. Oman saying that, we've got to dig into this. We're at the point right now where we have a pretty good sense of the overall data. This is just a big view. Right now, there's going to be resources put towards the principals to make sure that we're unpacking this at that school level. What does this mean for them? For some of these schools, even though you see the downward trend, they're increasing by spades. This isn't representative of how everyone's doing. It's just that bigger view. Ensuring that we're using this information as almost a benchmarking for our school improvements. Using the feedback from the administration. This is one of the things that I have been working on. I'm already gearing up for the spring administration. For me, and I'm glad I didn't do this, but I almost wanted to send out a survey to ask how the survey went, but that didn't seem like a good move. I've been trying to get as much information about how the survey experience was for different stakeholder groups. Little modifications, ensuring we don't miss out on any teachers for silly things. It's just wonky technical things, and we've been trying to do a lot of behind the scenes work, just to ensure that we're honoring everyone. This includes also some question modifications. I think ... I was just explaining what that comment was. I want to explain this in detail. I can't believe. I can't believe, I'm old, that there are teachers who work with us who were born after the year 2000. We definitely missed a little area for demographic information for some of our staff. That's entirely on me. I'm old. We've already fixed it. We're all old. We already fixed it for last time, so I apologize for that. That change was already made. I described a little while ago, we do a lot of surveys. We do. In my short time in this role, it's amazing to me how much information that different departments and different groups collect data. We have a ton of stuff. Being able to put this all together in a good, coherent place is part of a challenge. The director of SEL has expressed interest in thinking about shifting some of the SEL surveys to be housed within Panorama. Remember at the beginning I talked about the idea of the student facing information? Right now, what we're trying to do in our analysis of the overall structure of the survey system is to understand how we might be able to do that, if it's worth it to do that, and what it would mean. Right now, we're doing that. That focus is going to be on the student. There are some bits of information and some things that we'd like to know a little bit more in detail. It gives us that ability. Just optimizing it as a platform is where we would be. The last little thing is, for me, and this is the part of the work I like, is just working with all the other departments. Having a chance to sit down with Wes's department and think about what this might mean. Having a chance to sit down with Margaret's department and think about what this means. Those are going to be the little bits of work that we'll tackle over the next few months. With that said, that concludes my 30,000-foot overview. I would love any questions. I'll do the best I can to answer them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Morgan. Great. Thank you so much. I guess I'm going to go back. My overall feedback is I think that this was super helpful. I'm just one of seven and one of, I don't know how many people are in this room, 15. In the future, when we get this, I probably need to go to 15,000 feet. For me, this was fine. I think that the reported changes in each category is helpful. Because we sampled such a huge proportion of the population, even these onesie twosie percentage deltas are statistically significant. I mean, they are, right? But one and two, you can't, I don't get super excited. I'm kind of like, okay, neat. You know, four, five, six, sure. That gets my interest. I guess that, but I don't know how you do that because I'm not interested. I don't want to be in the business of comparing schools or comparing elementary to middle to high because I think that that's an, I don't really know how you get to 15,000 feet, so good luck. I can't, I don't, like, but for me, what's, I'm interested in more of those sort of nuances. And I think the work that you're doing, we saw it in the conversations that we had with the principals earlier, right? Because they were saying, oh, we're doing X, Y, and Z, and we're seeing this result. So that may be where I get to my 15,000 feet. It may not be in something like that. Can I? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just a response to that. I agree with you 100%. The goal, the reason why I kept on saying about the 30,000 foot is this wasn't about making any inferences or judgments about any particular school at the moment. You know, it really is at this point me making sure that they understand the impact for their school improvement plans. To help with that, you know, it's, I could probably sit here for way too long. I think what was shared also were some of these reports inside of the system, I believe. Yeah. And these will allow you to go into a lot more detail in that. I was trying to find that balance between just giving us that overview, talking about what our next big core steps would be, where we were in this process of using this data, some takeaways. I will say this. I was leading, the questions I chose for each of the categories, those were like the sixes. I wasn't choosing ones that were like ones or zeros. I was trying to give questions that either were in the positive or the negative that were impactful for that category. Just so all of you can kind of, here's a 30,000 foot, but here's a little inkling of why that may have changed. Yeah. So that was my splitting the difference. Which is great. And we're, I mean, we're going to, I assume, we're going to have a vote on Dr. Homan's goals later. I assume we're going to approve them, but they speak a lot to some of the information that's going to be in here. So I, the staff participation seemed low to me at 61%, like, what are we taking a percentage of? Like, is this of every human who gets a paycheck from, like, or like, are we giving, anyway, I don't necessarily need an answer to that, but like, I hope we're giving them time to do it. And that we're able to, because 61 seems, it seems low to me. If we got 49% of families to do it, I, so that seems like there's an opportunity there. What else did I have? Oh, yeah. And then the COVID protocols questions, probably, probably, I found, I was like, whoa, when I took it. I was like, yikes. So maybe we want to rethink those. And then I- Have we shared with Panorama that those need to come out of those categories? Because they're in the category, we can't take the question out without messing up the categorical calculation. Right. So what Dr. Homan's alluding to is some of these questions come in a bulk. Like if you talk about school safety, you get all the school safety. So these are the areas that when I'm working with them, thinking about the cost benefit, do you ask all of these for the sake that 75% within that category are really good? And how do you get rid of it? Sometimes you do have flexibilities to change things, but what you might lose is the nationally normed part of it. Because they're using some of the questions against each other. So it's just how you want to structure it. So those are the conversations that I'll be having and trying to understand what are the questions we really want to ask and what are the questions that we want to ask to ensure that we have that nationally normed data and all that other information. Great. And my last question is just around the experience of, and I recognize my experience is sort of unique. I have a lot of children. I have four of them. And my understanding is that I should fill this out four times, which I filled it out zero times because I just, like, I kind of couldn't get, I sort of thought I should do it and then I couldn't get past, like, well, which is my favorite child? Who am I going to fill this out for, right? Like, it was kind of like that, right? And then it's, so, and I don't know that there's any way to fix that. It's, but it's tricky. So we talked about that. I, you know, in working on this first administration, I received a lot of parent feedback. Some parents really wanted that ability to ask or answer for multiple students or children because they felt as though their kids were different and had very different experiences. Some were annoyed that they had to fill it out that many times. So I intentionally didn't say just because I was more curious what people would do. I think we probably have to draw a line in the sand and say, this is what we're going to do. For my first time through it, I didn't want to say do this because I was curious. I was curious. There was a little bit of experimentation from my point of view, because I want to understand what is that feedback from the families? I do think, though, we're always going to have families who will want to respond multiple times. Agreed. And I think the other group is just the group that's confused. Like, I got confused, and then I was like, and I've hit my, well, but is it, I mean, no, no, not really. I mean, because I got an email from multiple administrators being like, this is your, so but it is, it's one of those things where the activation barrier just tips a little bit, and then you kind of are like, panic, and then just don't do it. But I mean, we have, so the 49%, 46%, I can't remember. 49%. Is that, like, that's the number of, like. That calculation. How pray tell did we arrive at that number? For that one, I used the number of kids against the number of responses. So 3100, or whatever, 40, whatever how many students were in the overall versus the number of responses that we got back. So, but, so it's probably a much higher percentage of families. It could be. Oh, it definitely could be. As representative of much more than half of our families actually did more than I did, right? Did something, right? Like, took some, like, more than half of our families interacted with the survey in some way. Yes. Great. Can I take 30 more seconds to just say this? We do have also options. When we set up the staff survey, when we set up the student survey, we auto-populate everything and then send them an individualized survey. So that is tailored to them. For families, we just create a link and they respond. So there's no one-to-one correspondence. In working with Panorama, you always get a higher response rate from families when it is guaranteed anonymous for that family one. Because there's no record, it's just a link. You're just filling it out. So they, based on their experiences, we can set it up where we do the parent and it's sent directly to them, to their email, and that is their individual link. But there's a really big drop-off with participation because of that fact. So you've got to kind of find that in-between. So for, yeah, I don't know if that makes sense. I know. I mean, we use Pecan at my work and we all think that, like, HR is spying on us. And, like, they promise us backwards and forwards. They're like, no, no, this is totally anonymous. And we're like, ah, yeah, right. And then we don't fill it out. I actually do believe it is probably, like, anonymous, right? But there is that, like, that sense. I just want to be very clear. We do not have data that matches responses to human beings. We do not get that data. We do not want that data. But we do roster the kids and the teachers. We don't roster the families. And just even to clarify this, even though it's set up with a direct link for teachers and students, there is no way to link the responses in the platform. They actually intentionally do that. But you can see the teachers who respond and who don't. You can't see what their responses are. You can never see that. OK. So this is a follow-up, because I got questions from people about, you know, how many am I supposed to fill out? You said you were curious. Did you, like, if it's all that anonymized, did we, could we, did you learn anything? What I learned is I don't think I'm going to satisfy everybody. So I'll draw a line. That's what I learned. And that's learning. So, you know, we may have to draw a line in the sand and say, one per household. And then we'll work through supporting those families who may want to do it more than once. Or we might just say, fill it out for as many times as you want and work through that. OK. I've just, yeah, no. We could also roster and send an anonymized link. Well, that was my other question is, like, can you give people, like, can you, some of us don't care if, like, we might be findable. Some of us care a lot. I don't know, like, if there's, just to maximize it. Yeah. We can look into that. Thank you for this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to try to read my notes. So I was going to say, as another anecdote, I have two children at the same school. So I filled it out once because I felt like other than the individual student experience, the communication I felt like was global. So when they're at different schools, I might feel differently about two different responses. But anyway, so similar to Miss Morgan and not being a statistician, my question is, how do you, what of these changes are statistically significant and which is not? So I think it was, like, rigorous expectations. Was that the one that had a big drop off versus these ones that went up by one or two? Like, how can you say, oh, look, we're doing better in this when it's, like, an extra person answered the question? Yeah. This is also perception data. This is all how we feel about it. So even working with the principals and the directors the other day, we talked about the ladder of inference and, you know, thinking about notice and wonderings and thinking about these takeaways and not having your biases come through and finding an answer right away and really exploring and looking for other sources of data. You know, it's that triangulation, that ability to lean into the inquiry as opposed to lean into the judgment. I know this isn't 100% answering your question, but it really is a shift in the mindset. It really is thinking about this in more of a proactive kind of journey sort of way as opposed to this summative, this is how we did. And that's what I've been trying to do in working with all of those folks is how do we use this data to inform what we're doing? So for some of the principals, it's already sparked some other questions. For some of them, you know, there was one particular principal who was, like, psyched because their data clearly showed their strategic plan, one of their goals, it was directly related to a set of questions, and it was a lot of positive growth. So really thinking about that as a metric that's showing at least a perception or some context that they're showing growth. And then leaning into some others who were, like, oh, it may have been a dip, but what could be the cause for what those dips were? And not, like, saying it was definitely this, but it could have been this, it could have been this. All right, so what could be a next possible? step. Does it mean we rewrite a goal or does it mean we tweak the goal or change the benchmark? That's the that's that habit that I'm hoping to instill on folks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it sounds like it's sort of easier maybe to do this at a school level which for us here at the committee is sort of too specific. We want the overview we want the general overview but really we should be looking at this at that school level. And then one other just one other piece to this around sort of the the context and the belonging and the cultural awareness and action and all in the school climate I want to sort of we're doing we're working on this and improving this in the sort of intention that when students feel a sense of belonging and they have a positive school climate and teachers are happy to be at work students are gonna achieve at a higher rate that's where we're going with this and so I guess another piece of this story that I would be interested in in hearing in the future is how does this match with you know what we're seeing very like lined up somehow I don't know how you do this with with our achievement data like is are we are these things connected? I think the power of this survey lives in the longitudinal analysis. We've focused a lot in our reporting and Mr. Coleman focused a lot tonight on belonging and rigorous expectations because we see those as mapping against achievement data. When we see steady improvement even if it's 1% every year every time we've administered since 2021 but that's steady in belonging and that's improving and we see a similar trend in rigorous expectations and that's improving and then we have an awesome accountability year like we did this year then our theory of actions working out right we're seeing that over time as we focus on specific areas do specific things at specific schools where it is a little easier to trace we did this and it did that but system-wide that longitudinal trend is is very encouraging on particular areas where we've really been focusing our attention what this survey is useful for and why it's in my goals is highlighting areas where we might be seeing a dip we might be seeing a decline the cultural awareness and action is a really interesting shift in how students are perceiving their experiences in school and how families are as well and it's coming at a cultural time when it's there there are things we can potentially think about and consider as contributors and contributing factors that may be beyond our locus of control or influence or but that are part of how we interact and engage with families every single day so we need to think about new ways to do that and so that becomes a goal for the next year and a focus area but we keep our laser focus on belonging expectations and keeping those high because we think those two things together help like if a student's held high expectations they know we believe they can achieve and that helps them feel a sense of belonging and connection to their teachers and that helps them achieve and those three things together are having the impact that we wanted to have yep so we need some some image it puts all that together we'll work on that we have to get Leo for that I'm not artistically inclined okay I've got a bunch of stuff here too first of all in pushing for belonging you're talking about being able to tweak certain aspects of what's going on with the panorama I've got a hundred twenty families here whose language wasn't listed can we fix that they yes so do you want the quick answer to that yeah based on the questions that you choose internally for panorama they only offer that's another one the way it's a it's it's a if you I'm gonna make this up if I choose this set of questions on school climate and internally they've only translated for seven languages every time you choose a new thing it changes the language that you offered so we had pushed on them to keep offering more they just didn't have it their response was well if you take out these we can get it up to 15 languages so it was one of those where you know based on what you ask that's there their promises that they're always translating and always offering in more languages that one for this administration was less out of our control than I would have liked I agree with you a hundred percent can we get that that's a question directly question 11 what language do you mostly speak at home yeah even if we can't translate it because I know that we've got folks who are multi who speak a different language at home who are fluent enough in English to respond to the survey but to not get to be able to represent them in the here is certainly really counter to our I agree and I think we're missing our biggest two languages in this district that's my guess I mean you got 120 families here 4% of the total on the plus one thing plus one you know it could be 49.4 to 49.6 which by rounding goes from a 49 to a 50 and it's really not significant what I you know what I what I'm interested in most to tell you the truth what I'm looking at the data is in the order of magnitude of changes okay here's our plus 7 here's our minus 6 and obviously the ones who are out there are of interest the ones that really didn't change unless we're really going and trying to move that particular number aren't as interesting as the ones who change the other thing that I really really need is the benchmark because without knowing what that national norm is it's just a number floating in there is a 49% compared to 25% nationally and we're that 49% is is really high we're doing well compared to the rest of the world or is the rest of the world at 80 in anytime I see that number I need that anchor and so then my last follow-up question because you know Miss Morgan is really good statistician has pushed a lot of good questions and she also asked are we giving time and I think that's sort of the question if for the staff surveys that if we have employees that we're contracting time for and we say hey guys we're going to give you an extra half hour off go do whatever you want but you have to have the survey done that's sort of the way we did it in law when I worked there and we got you know huge numbers on the staff are we doing something like that or can we do something like that we did that so then it should be our expectation that we get a higher number staff well yes and yes this is all staff and we don't right we have been focusing on making sure teaching staff fill out the survey so it's possible that some of those who did not or some of our operational staff who qualify as staff in the survey not as teachers the other thing to note is that teachers who go to multiple schools or are assigned to multiple schools show up at all of those schools in the stats and so it's it's not 62% it's higher than that in terms of staff who took the survey because if I'm at Gibbs and Audusin I'm gonna take the survey Gibbs or Audusin I'm not we're not gonna ask staff to take it at every single school they hit especially if they are at multiple so that's it's a slightly deflated number can we get that is there some sort of way we can sort of figure out that number to get it accurate because if these guys are really going out and doing it and it's some sort of quirk in the way we're going about asking the question I'd like to recognize the fact that the teachers are really taking you seriously and giving us a good set of answers I lost my microphone we had 418 there's about 500 unit a members maybe a little bit over that so that gives you some idea time was given on the November 1st professional day to do this we had a cohort of elementary teachers who were doing EL training all of that day so they may not have gotten to it and for the non teaching staff remember we have paraprofessionals who don't have computers can we send a better message of yeah we we care about you and this really is important because we want to make the way I sent reminders out for this in my weekly updates as well to members the comment I heard most from people was I've been doing that for years and they've never listened to anything I've said on it so why am I gonna keep wasting my time doing it I think people have put a lot into their narrative comments which are never included in any of the reporting out that comes from it and what they're seeing is I keep telling people about concerns and issues and problems and nobody's listening so I was telling people this time like just felt the numbers I don't even care if you write anything just felt the numbers so so for just in terms of the timeline this year I think we did a little later we weren't able to get it for the November 1st it was later on in different staff meetings I think for this year I think it was one of the things that we've tried to do for the narrative is it was a little yeah I think was a little later that was on me I didn't get it done in time so and this is also true for the communication ones and this this one also is kind of the goal and the intentionality of trying to set up the survey for the parents a lot of the questions were centered the narrative questions were centered on the idea of communication the numerical values pretty much represent that I believe I have to look back at the core set of questions the area that was important for staff this year just connected to the the strategic plan centered on professional development and supports there I had a question also about cultural awareness but that was also centered on PD we could definitely share out those narratives but it was more a lot of those comments were more centered on that for this year just because that was that connection to the strategic in it the strategic plan one of the one other quick quick question I'm not gonna say quick question I hate when people do that another panorama specific question so that if you have multiple children like Miss Morgan and is there any way for the panorama survey to sort of do you have another child in the district if so we go back to logic is there some way to do that in a recursive way question yeah I'm sure that that's something it's vexing every district that's using it because if we then go and say oh if you have four children just pick one that then what's going to happen is that people are going to to go for the child they have something to say about which is going to skew the numbers either high or low depending on how they feel about that particular child's experience I haven't asked them about the that type of question or that type of setup so first thank you for coming we love to hear data and and this position has worked out great from my perspective because we're getting good presentations on data we've got somebody who can aggregate the data and we can actually do something with it and and not just let it sit on the shelf so that's a great improvement thank you</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with miss Morgan a little bit that I mean you did present some of the trend data and we're sort of relying on you to pick out the things that you think are most interesting but maybe a little bit more context a little bit more of those those trend items or you know for example like school climate is discussed at in each of the surveys but to look at that data to compare like the different levels you got to flip the pages you know and it's just hard to to sort of see what's going on there so a little bit more data would be would be great and then my question was about the was going to ask about oh so dr. Homan mentioned the great improvement in belonging at at the Hardy and and I guess are there other pops or declines that you saw or that's for later analysis or it could be for later I'm I fancy myself good with numbers I don't think I don't I don't think I can remember I say this in all honesty like knowing I went through each of the schools individually went through the district I don't recall each of them like I wasn't even trying to but to answer your question yeah I mean time to include but yeah there were a lot of those and like I kind of mentioned what was important to me was putting folks in a position to start to think about this data as benchmarking for a lot of their goals you know mr. Slickman you were talking about kind of prioritizing them the way I kind of worked with them and prioritizing them was more or less all right this is what you intended to do these were your goals what does that information tell you relative to that even if it's a zero plus minus or whatever and the second part was have you learned anything else besides that I think it was alluded to by dr. Homan like what might be good precursors to future goals or changes the goals so I was using a little more of that as the way in which we have a lens on this information I just I want intentionality I want there to be all right this is what we're trying to do and here's ways in which we can measure what that might be great thank you</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;real quick yeah to both to mr. Carter's point to mr. Pullman's point and the miss keys point we've done more with this mid-year administration than we have at the mid-year administration ever and and that includes getting leaders into the room to look at the data within a month of it coming back working on some reporting out to staff so that we can say here's what you said here's what we're doing and putting it together with some other information that we have about what schools are doing what I'm hearing from staff when I visit schools so I think you know yes this has been a big capacity builder having mr. Coleman's role in place and having him in it and we're really trying to get better about taking it in and then getting it back out to people to say here's what we heard here's what we're gonna do with it right now here's what we are still working on we're not quite sure exactly what we're gonna do with it yet but you're gonna keep hearing about it because we've heard that feedback that you know we do this we don't quite know what the district does with it after we do it so we're trying to get quicker on the turnaround okay now I get a chance I actually I'm not gonna everyone's asked lots of good questions I just had two kind of questions one for the learning behaviors one I just wonder if that's at all affected because we've been trying to decrease or eliminate homework at the elementary school levels and so I know the kids are maybe supposed to be reading but that the homework was kind of what the parent saw in terms of learning learning behaviors right and if they're not doing it they don't have anything to really talk about and and so that's one question and you could anyway you can figure things out then the other thing is when you're doing comparing to the national norms I just like to have a better understanding of what what the Nash you know what is the national norm and just I you know I look on their website and they have names but it doesn't tell me that all the schools in that district are doing it or or just some sense of you know it's just this blob I don't have any idea you know all I know is a blob with some names of school districts in it I don't know are all the schools in that district represented are do they do all the question you know anything like that so those are those are kind of my questions</blockquote>

We made sure that there were six all district early releases. I think we adjusted the date on one of them. Ms. Diggins, can you remind me if there were any other adjustments to these? We adjusted some conferences, yep, so they weren't the week of the holiday break. Okay, so my understanding had been that we wanted to get feedback before we approved it before Labor Day start on in the 26-27 calendar. Yes. And so we haven't gotten that feedback, correct? Correct. So are we only looking to approve the first two? Yes, so we have final for the first two in your materials and just the same file for 26-27, but it doesn't say final on it because we were anticipating you would vote those first two. Okay, so does someone, okay first, well, does someone want to make a motion to approve the 24-25 and 25-26 calendars? So moved. Second. And does anyone have any comments or questions about these? Okay, seeing none, all in favor? Aye. Aye. Sorry, said it in my head. Any opposed? Any abstentions? Okay, so that passes unanimously, if quietly,

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, update. All right, so I have several for today. First of all, I want to thank all the volunteers and Amy Speer, who is chair of the Arlington High School Building Committee's subcommittee for communications. We had AHS tours last Saturday on the 20th, and even though it was unbelievably cold outside, we had 2,000 people come, and most of them even ventured outside to check out the preschool, and we're very excited about how beautiful it is, and some of them even ventured into our offices to see the school committee room. So we're really excited to welcome all of those community members, including lots of future students at the high school, into our tours. Everybody thought the space was just absolutely beautiful, very impressive work by all of our teams that have contributed to the opening of phase two, and it was a great success. We are very pleased to have started a morning OMS bus run. I don't think it started yet, actually, I think it starts next week, but we have many families who are interested in this. It runs from East Arlington to Audison Middle School in the mornings only to alleviate some of the pressure on the MBTA routes that have resulted in some students having trouble getting to school. Timing is good, given the weather, what it is at this time of year, and we're looking into what we can do to meet some of the demand, because we did have some pretty high demand for this bus. We ran a lottery randomly to determine who would have access to it, and we're looking into the capacity of the run or whether we can do two. AHS Nordic Skiing update really quickly. They are having a wonderful season. There's a picture of them in action there at the bottom of your screen. This is, again, just as a reminder, the first year that this team has been up and running, and we've gotten some updates that they're having a wonderful season and are grateful for the school committee's support of this new team and that we were able to get it in place. A quick working groups update. We have 10 to 15 members per working group. Again, these are the strategic plan working groups. They are led by members of our cabinet team and administration as facilitators, but they're sort of facilitator members. They work alongside members of the working group to implement small actions tied to the strategic plan in order to influence and inform actions that will come later and that will inform budget priorities for FY26. They're meeting two hours per month. They're conducting inquiry and action research cycles aligned to the initiatives. There's a full member list that is in your materials and that I will also be publishing to the community in the February 1 newsletters to staff and to families. We've had some members who, in retrospect, haven't been able to join. We've been adding new members in, so there's a little bit of fluctuation happening, but we're really pleased to have added all of our members and had two meetings of the full groups in January to get a good head start. APS has been awarded. This is great news out of this week. We were awarded a Mass Save Climate Leader at the Statehouse. Thank you to school committee members who were able to attend. Mr. Thielman, Mr. Schlickman, and Dr. Allison Ampey were there to accept the award with me. We're really pleased about this because it's been a lot of effort by building committees, both for the Gibbs School and the Arlington High School, as well as efforts that we've undertaken with the town to increase electric capacity and buses in town, so it's really an honor to be recognized alongside other municipalities and companies across the state as a climate leader, and we want to say a public thank you also to Talia, who was with us earlier, for the work that she's done spearheading some of our sustainability work in town. The LGBTQIA plus task force had a meeting this week on creating inclusive learning environments. I want to say thank you to our panelists, AC, a fourth grade teacher at Brackett, Renee, Pierce Elementary School librarian, Justin, a high school English teacher, and Jasper, an AHS junior, were all panelists at this event last night sharing their perspectives and answering questions with the 20 or so community members who attended the forum in person at the high school. Also, these past couple of weeks, we celebrated Martin Luther King's birthday. The OMS eighth grade choir came on their day off that evening to sing a song that's inspired by Amanda Gorman's poem that she recited at an inauguration, and the AHS Honors Orchestra Ensemble also performed works by an African American composer and artist. The MLK birthday celebration was fantastic. I don't know why it's in my update twice, but I thought it was worth mentioning twice, clearly. Kindergarten registration is going to launch. Our launch goal is February 1st. That is a launch goal. It may not be February 1st. We're working out the final details on that date. We have a brand new registration team, new staff running this effort, so it's their first time. We want to make sure that we have everything really ironed out and perfect in the forms before we launch them. We will be making sure that we message this a lot to all of our families so that they can let anybody who they know has a kindergartener coming in know that kindergarten has launched. We'll put it on the website. We'll put it in our newsletters, and we will be sending snail mail to all of the families that we know have an incoming kindergartener as well. There will be extended Welcome Center service hours through the month of February, and we're looking to do visits at school sites, too, to make it easier for families to get to us if they need help with K registration or filling out any of that paperwork. And your enrollments are in your materials. I'll happily take any questions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any questions? I went to the LGBTQ IA forum last night, and Dr. Ford Walker also was there. She offered welcoming remarks, and this was a spectacular event. This was really well done by staff members and a student who were open and honest about their experiences with us, and you know, were personally revealing in their experiences both in life and in the Arlington Public Schools, and it was well worth coming out to see, and I think that the folks who participated in that need to be commended.

This is what we have to do every year to satisfy whatever. I know Michael's not here. I was just checking, and it's off by a few thousand from who was in the last version of the long-range plan that I have. I checked it and came up, actually, let's make sure this is the number that I thought we had. I had checked it and thought it was okay. If you've checked it, then fine. This came from the deputy town manager directly this week. Yeah, it was the number of students was different, and so that made, and I checked that it worked out. Okay. Okay.

Yeah that's I know that there's been people to who want to us to have another one like every month or something and I just wanted to point out that that event took a spear probably a week of man hour beforehand to plan plus a number of days in advance of that plus the time that the principals put into it and the administration plus all the volunteer time so it's not something that we can just go and it's we're not just opening the doors of the school and saying here come on in we're opening it but in a way that we can keep the building safe protected and in good shape and to do that requires a lot more effort than I think people are aware of so yes I echo the thanks for the volunteers but also oh and we are we'll have a tour a video tour of the new part of the high school up on the website very soon and I know we've got the draft one coming through the communications subcommittee so if you miss the tour you can look for that and you can see some of the spaces and hear an explanation yeah one thing I kind of if you if the public's interested to for updates you can just go to Arlington high school ahsbuilding.org and there's a blog there's videos there's plenty of information to get updated on the project</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;um liaison reports yep um on Monday January 29th the Arlington Education Foundation will be hosting its annual innovation showcase at Punjab uh Dr. Ford Walker will be the guest speaker uh live music small plates cash bar um a suggested donation of $50 and you can register in advance at the AEF website or you can stop by on Monday at Punjab and I hope committee members will come it's a really lovely evening um any other liaison reports okay I'm going to report on one um the I attended with Dr. Holman a um it's a video conference for the influence 100 run by the center for strategic initiatives um which is a program that two of our um employees are going through Ms. Pierre and here yes and um so each quarter they have both the uh enrollees and also the superintendent and a school committee member is it a chair or just a school committee a school committee member school committee member chair yeah um attend the the conference and so there's people from Bedford and and where else Groton and a whole bunch of different towns um and uh so we attended this just a couple weeks ago and I just want to say it's really it's really an interesting thing they're talking about how to what they're trying to do is help improve the number of people of color in positions of authority in districts but also improve the experiences that the students and other staff were having and they're trying to teach the the um enrollees how to help make that happen and also influence I think the superintendent and the school committee members um and so I've attended just like the second or third I don't remember I can't remember either yeah anyway so um and it's just it's a really interesting program I'm glad we're participating in it and I wish there was something more with it that we could share out to the full school committee I think not to put them on the spot Miss Pierre's listening in um that we could potentially have them share a little bit about the experience at some point surprise um but it is a program designed to increase the representation of people of color in the superintendency specifically and so it is a superintendent building professional development opportunity but it's also as members of a cohort they have the opportunity to do action research to influence the district itself uh in its equity and racial equity efforts in particular so it's a wonderful program that I've been part of. This is now in my second district. It's supporting cohort members and it's it's had an impact. A lot of people who have gone through the program have become assistant superintendents or superintendents or district leaders in other systems and are increasing the diversity of senior leadership and districts across the state. So I don't think we want to put Miss Pierre on the spot. We don't have to right now. Yeah we don't have to right now but I think yes it'd be nice to put that on the agenda and at some point in the future. So okay that was my liaison report. Any announcements? Okay future agenda items? Seeing none</blockquote>
