He then explained the accountability system, its changes, modifications, and the components that are back in play. He also discussed the indicators used for measurement, the new pathways for progress, and how points are assigned. He provided a summary of the system, the different components, and the specific indicators that guide the scoring. He also discussed the new aspect of the program for the year that gives a sense of where the district is relative to 2019, 2022, and today.

</details><details><summary>List the indicators used for measurement and the points assigned in the new accountability system as described by Matt Coleman.</summary>

> The new accountability system uses five indicators for measurement: achievement, student growth, high school completion, English learner proficiency, and additional indicators. Each of these indicators includes various components. For example, the additional indicators include chronic absenteeism and the percentage of 11th and 12th graders completing at least one advanced course. The system assigns points based on how well a school or district meets its targets. If a target is exceeded, four points are awarded. If a target is met, three points are awarded. If there is some improvement but the target is not met, one point is awarded. If there is no change or a decline, zero points are awarded.

The committee members agreed that the district's progress towards meeting state-set targets was commendable.

The department's instructional practices aim to promote health and wellness on a daily basis and work collaboratively with students to improve their overall wellness. 

Visco also discussed the department's student objectives, which include developing a plan for lifelong skills that will enhance overall well-being, recognizing personal needs and how to achieve them, finding appropriate practices that will enhance social-emotional learning and well-being, and striving to challenge themselves intellectually to develop a growth mindset. 

She also mentioned the department's work over the summer, which included updating the curriculum, creating a K-12 website, and conducting professional development sessions on skill-based learning in health, inclusive languages in the classroom and curriculum, and mindfulness and yoga practice. 

Visco also highlighted the department's work in promoting cardiovascular fitness and the addition of the FACTS department into wellness.

</details><details><summary>Describe succinctly the 4th and 5th grade human growth and development curriculum, e.g. sex ed., revisions.</summary>

> The 4th and 5th grade human growth and development curriculum, also known as sex education, underwent revisions to make it more inclusive and comprehensive. The puberty content remained the same, but the Procter and Gamble video that was part of the original lessons was removed and replaced with teacher talking points. The curriculum was updated to include more inclusive language and resources to explain gender. The lessons were well received by students, with a majority reporting that they learned something new and found the information organized and not confusing. The curriculum was further revised over the summer, with adjustments made to the visuals and the addition of more activities to include peer discussions about puberty and problem-solving activities. The curriculum now covers topics such as stages of development, growing up, sex assigned at birth, gender changes during puberty, and products used during puberty for 4th graders, and a review of these topics along with lessons on pituitary gland hormones and reproductive organs for 5th graders.
</details><details><summary>What concerns about the Wellness curriculum were raised by school committee members?</summary>

> School committee members raised concerns about the inclusivity of the Wellness curriculum, particularly in relation to LGBTQ+ students. They discussed the importance of having inclusive language throughout the curriculum and ensuring that all students feel a sense of belonging. There were also discussions about the need for the curriculum to reflect issues of sexual orientation and gender identity. Additionally, there were concerns about the use of certain resources, such as the Procter & Gamble video, which was removed due to its binary gendered language. The committee also discussed the need for the curriculum to be aligned with the National Sex Ed Standards.
</details><details><summary>What materials for the human growth curriculum with be made public?  What is the district's stance concerning legally mandated disclosure of teaching materials?</summary>

> The district has stated that the curriculum for the human growth and development lessons will be posted publicly in NOVAS, an online platform. However, the actual lesson slides will not be posted as they can be taken out of context. The district invites parents who want to review the curriculum in detail to schedule a meeting with the relevant teacher. The district believes this approach is in compliance with the law that requires teaching materials to be reasonably accessible to parents and guardians for inspection and review.
