<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I'd like to bring this regular school committee meeting of February 8, 2024 to order. We had a slight delay because we're still working out technical issues before we okay so first, we're able to do this in a hybrid form because of multiple governor orders. And I want to remind everyone who is at home that people can see what's on your computer screen. I also want to check formally that our school committee members who are participating remotely can hear and respond to us. So, Ms. Gittleson, I know I saw you before. And I can hear. Okay. Ms. Exton, I'm going to need the Brady Bunch view. I need the multiple screens. There we go. Yeah. Okay, that's good. I just, I need to be able to see everyone. Okay. Okay. So, Ms. Exton, can you? Yes. Okay. Ms. Ferrante is here as our AEA representative and the superintendent is listening in but it will not be participating tonight. Dr. Ford-Walker will be our acting superintendent today and I think that's everybody.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kirsi Allison-Ampe - 268</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so now we go on to public comment. Before I begin, I'd like to review sections of our current policy, DEDH, which governs public comment. During the public comment section of regular school committee meetings, individuals or groups may address the committee on items of school business. The length of public participation shall normally be no more than 20 minutes but may be extended by the chair. Speakers must identify themselves by name and address and will be allowed up to three minutes to present their material. The chairperson may reduce speaking time if needed and or may permit extension of this time limit. Improper conduct and remarks, including use of obscenity or abusive language, will not be allowed. Defamatory or abusive remarks are always out of order. If a speaker persists in improper conduct or remarks, the chairperson may terminate the individual's privilege of address. All remarks will be addressed through the chairperson of the meeting. Speakers may offer such objective criticisms of the school operations and programs as concern them, but in public session, the committee will not hear personal complaints about school personnel nor against any other member of the school community except for the school committee or the superintendent in their capacity as operational leader of Arlington Public Schools. Under most circumstances, administrative channels are the proper means for disposition of legitimate complaints involving staff members. The public is reminded that the school committee does not hold jurisdiction over the performance of personnel other than the superintendent. So our first person on for public participation is Cattell Gulick, sorry if I'm mispronouncing that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's okay. Thank you. I didn't realize, so I apologize. I haven't been to a lot of these meetings, so I didn't realize that this was the first thing on the agenda. I thought that the presentations were first. You're up. Okay. Well, I've got two things I want to comment on quickly. One is my hope, I guess, since I haven't heard the presentation yet now, that we'll hear some updates on how the district is trying to improve the way they serve the children getting special ed services here. And that includes things like, you know, what is the district's obligation to, you know, recognize child find in a timely way, in a proactive way, identifying our students with disabilities and also the plans to, you know, improve communication and transparency between the district and families, which in my experience as a parent over the past five years has been sorely, sorely lacking. I know the school committee is aware of all this already, but we've been told that the more we bring it up, the more we might be heard. The other thing I wanted to mention, I'm a parent of a Gibbs student, and I'm really concerned about the way that the event there was addressed. Children were texting their parents from school, crying, saying they were terrified, saying I love you. And we haven't heard, other than like the boilerplate email of like there's someone to talk to if they want to. We really haven't heard like how the kids' mental health is being addressed. We also haven't heard any update on whether the community member who dropped shell casings in the school and attends an evening class there is going to be back on campus. So actually I had to call Arlington police myself to get that update. And finally, I don't know why the district didn't use robocalls to reach parents, which they use when there are like snow days and other much less intense events. So many parents who can't check their emails regularly because of their jobs were quite surprised to find out what was happening at the school. So those are my comments. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot to mention that we don't respond at this time. I need the Brady Bunch one again. We don't respond. We just listen at this point. The next one is Cheryl Miller, also remote.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Cheryl Miller - 354</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. Cool. My name is Cheryl Miller. My address is 10 Thesda Street. And I'm the parent of two autistic children with IEPs in the Arlington Public Schools. Tonight Allison Elmer will be presenting her special education program report. That report lists as one of the highlights of the year that the district is rolling out QBS training, a crisis management and restraint training system to be used with some of the most vulnerable students in the district. According to the company's website, QBS training is grounded in behaviorism, particularly Applied Behavior Analysis, or ABA. ABA is often described as evidence-based, but as far as I'm aware, the evidence is only that ABA increases compliance. If there is evidence that it improves well-being, life satisfaction, or mental health, I have not been able to find it. There is, however, evidence that ABA causes harm to those who are subjected to it. Experiencing ABA is associated with increased risk of PTSD among autistic people. Autistic people who have experienced behavior therapy have described it as dog training, as dehumanizing, and as abuse. I know that behaviorism and ABA are deeply embedded in the Arlington Public Schools. I know that you can't just snap your fingers and get rid of those practices and values overnight. However, if the district is authentic in its goal of creating an environment of safety and belonging for all students, and in its DEI initiatives, particularly in the area of justice, then the goal must be to move away from behaviorist and compliance-based practices and toward practices based on respect for disabled children as full humans, not collections of behaviors to be analyzed and reinforced or extinguished. Choosing a behavior management system was an opportunity to listen to the voices of disabled and autistic people, the populations most likely to be subjected to it. Please, members of the school committee, don't let this go by you without asking the district how this decision was made, how disabled voices were heard in the process, and how it is consistent with the district's stated values. Thank you.</blockquote>

I was in here at the last meeting, so I don't know if it was already talked about, but we had the Winter Crafts Fair, and that went amazing. There is, I think, over 30 vendors, a lot of attendance from both school and community members. It was really fun. I actually got this necklace there. There was a lot of wonderful vendors. Also in two days, there's Battle of the Bands at the Regent Theater. Get tickets. It's awesome. It'll be really fun. Tickets are on the Regent Theater website. And then next week, before break, we're having a Spirit Week, and that includes, on Tuesday, a trivia competition, where you dress up as a team to win, I think, a gift card prize. And then the PonderCast, a student-run podcast, in a way, a newsletter, debuted today, I believe, and it's promising. And then sport seasons are coming to an end, or going into playoffs, and teams are doing good.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * Stratton SIP 23-24 Presentation      * 2023 - 2024 SIP Stratton Okay, next we have the Stratton. Do you want to come on up? Good evening, everyone. Hello. I'd like to introduce Principal Amy Kelly and the Stratton team. Principal Kelly is in her first year here in Arlington. She's joined us with a number of years of experience as a school leader in Newton and a district leader in Weston. The Stratton community has warmly welcomed Principal Kelly, and I can speak on behalf of Dr. Holman and many others and say that Arlington is lucky to have Principal Kelly with us. We're very excited about the work that she's leading at Stratton, and look forward to the team's presentation this evening, so welcome.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Amy Kelly - 428</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you so much. Fortunately, I have a fabulous team here with me, but I do want to start by just thanking you all for the incredibly warm welcome and the support that I've already received here in Arlington. So I'm thrilled to be able to speak on behalf of the amazing educators and families at Stratton. And most of what we'll share tonight is the result of the work done by Stratton's instructional leadership team, many folks who are here tonight, and as well as our school council, our PTO, and also a response to the 100-plus entry interviews that I did as part of my entry process at Stratton. I think because the Stratton community and Arlington as a whole has been so welcoming, I forget that I've often, I mean, I've just done my entry process fairly recently. In fact, today was my 100th day of school at Stratton. So as I mentioned, I'm here with some members of our instructional leadership team who will introduce themselves in a moment. And if you'll change the slide, I'll share our agenda. So we're going to start by celebrating some of what's good at Stratton, and then we'll share a small slice of the data that we used for our improvement planning. We'll share our priority goals and some actions that we're already taking to meet those goals. And finally, we'll answer any questions that you have. So at Stratton, we start our meetings with this what's good protocol. This gives folks an opportunity to share good news in their personal lives or in their work lives. The good news ranges from the magnitude of a staff member's wedding celebration to a positive interaction with a student during a math lesson. Members of our ILT will share a couple of details about what's good at Stratton. I'll start us off. And I just want to start by saying Dr. O'Brien, our assistant principal, had planned to be here tonight. She is not well, so we miss her, and I'm taking her part right now. So just a couple of things to say about our instructional leadership team. We hadn't, Stratton had an instructional leadership team last year. I feel like we've really come together this year around the foundational practices of a multi-tiered system of support in terms of academic and also social and emotional and behavioral work. So that's really been our focus, learning about MTSS and beginning to look at our foundational pieces at Stratton. And now Amy is going to go next.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I'm Amy Lees. Move the microphone down. Either one. I'm Amy Lees, and I teach third grade at Stratton, and I've had your children. And your children, and someone at home, Sam's mom, Liz, son too. So Stratton's core approach to teaching positive behavior is through responsive classroom. Our school-wide positive behavior plan has three guidelines. It's be safe, be kind, and be respectful. Like languages used by all when reminding and redirecting, all areas of the school have specific expectations. Staff and students are well-versed in these expectations, and they're posted throughout the school and classrooms alongside classroom constitutions that are authored by the students.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, everybody. I'm Kathy Silman. I am the math coach at Stratton, and I'm going to talk a little bit about our PLCs, and in particular, what we do around data analysis. So this year, our weekly grade-level meetings are occurring as PLCs, or professional learning communities. In the fall, grade-level teams wrote common student learning and professional practice goals, and then these shared goals are what is primarily driving our PLC meetings. You have to either be right in the mic or much louder, because this is highly directional. Do I need to start over? No. Oh, now I can understand. Oh, sorry. Okay. I'll just recap the good parts. So our grade-level teams wrote common student learning and professional practice goals, and this is what's primarily driving our PLC work. As part of the work, we plan purposeful cycles to collect and analyze data. For example, in math, we're looking at fluency screeners, unit screeners, MCAS, and other types of formative assessments, depending on the grade level and the goals. Over the course of the year, our PLC work has included looking for patterns of student strengths, challenges based on data, professional learning, and planning instructional responses for individual students, small groups, and the whole class as needed. Overall, teams are developing a greater sense of collective efficacy as we collaboratively design action steps, plan interventions, and targeted activities, especially during win times, which we'll talk about in a minute. And we aim to build on students' strengths while supporting their ongoing learning needs. And I'm going to pass the mic to Ann Rea. I'll just switch to you for a second.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. I'm Ann Rea Abbott. I'm a second grade teacher at Stratton. I'm just going to speak to the professional development and collaboration with the SLC program. I am currently a general education teacher on the SLC team. I have felt very supported by the SLC team that supports my class. I have a couple of examples of that for you. When I communicated with the lead SLC teacher that I work with, that I did not understand how the communication devices were used, I was invited to a training initiated by that teacher, professional development. My other example is after one of the SLC paraprofessionals that I work with in my classroom, Daly, and I brainstormed how to support a student during the morning meeting. We brought our ideas to this SLC lead teacher that afternoon. And the next morning, we had a visual to support our vision for the student. The student has been very successful with the tool we created collaboratively, consultation and collaboration. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Stuart Deck. I'm a paraprofessional at Stratton Elementary School, particularly with a math focus. I work with students throughout the building in mathematics. We've held faculty workshops to expand the understanding of social, emotional learning, identity and culturally responsive teaching for paraprofessionals and our entire teaching staff. We've engaged in exercises that helped us examine our assumptions about economic imbalances and how they can affect our teaching. Through focus group training, we've talked about how important a welcoming learning community is to the students themselves, and we've worked on ways to be aware of widening our community circles so that no students feel left out. In particular paraprofessional training, we've also worked together to understand the value of thoughtful use of language and how to carefully build learning communities. Beth Federico is to my right here with me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Stuart. I'm Beth Federico. I'm one of two teachers that works with multilingual students at Stratton. I'm going to talk about our regular communication. So our principal, Amy, has strengthened... staff communication by sending us weekly updates about happenings and embedding inspirational content for us to consider. She also sends these to our parents. To connect with families, she's implemented monthly coffees with the principal, and she works with the PTO and the school council. Notes from PTO meetings are shared with the Stratton staff. Something my ML colleague and I do to foster communication is create and share a monthly newsletter. Students appreciate that we share the newsletter with them because it helps support all of our students, and parents appreciate the newsletters because we use parent input to discuss topics that can be confusing or new to our multilingual parents.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Amy Kelly - 1365</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. So last year, Stratton had a DEI council, but it was solely a parent group. This year, we've added faculty members to that group, and also the DEI council and the Rainbow Alliance have teamed up to support more school-wide initiatives and events. Most recently, the DEI council hosted Stratton's inaugural Pancakes Around the World event a couple of Sundays ago, which was quite delicious and well-attended. We're also very excited about the opportunities that our EL curriculum, the new EL curriculum, is and will continue to provide for supporting students to become participatory citizens through service learning. In November, our students participated in the Wooden Spoons Project, where we raised money for Arlington Eats. We've got the Stratton Pride-a-thon coming up in the spring, and soon our KTO, which is a student-designed and led group, will begin performing community service for our teachers by helping them after school with in-class small projects that they need help with. Next slide. Here's some of our basic demographic data. I just want to draw your attention to our high-needs numbers, our high-needs percentage of nearly 30%. Our high-needs focal group is an unduplicated count of all students belonging to at least one of the following groups. Students with disabilities, English language learners or multilingual learners, former English language learners, or low-income students. So although we often look at these focal groups separately for this evening in terms of our focus on our goals, we'll be speaking about our high-needs group as our focal group. Next slide, thanks. So many of these goals are probably not new to you. My colleagues and I worked closely together to have some common goals, and you can see, or you will see, that we have two academic goals, a culture and climate goal, and a family engagement goal. And I'm going to go into more detail around each of these. Next slide. Okay, so our first academic goal is around addressing the achievement gap in literacy between our students identified as high-needs and non-high-needs. Similar to my colleagues in the other schools, we're using universal screening data to drive our approaches to instruction, as well as the consistent use of foundations, hegerty, and the adoption of our EL curriculum. Next slide, please. Okay, so why this goal? As you know, it's important to look at MCAS data, this kind of satellite-level data, and here you can see a fairly large gap between the percentage of last year's third-graders identified as high-needs and non-high-needs students exceeding or meeting or exceeding the expectations. And if you go to the next slide, you'll see an even larger gap with last year's fourth-graders. And then next slide, gap narrowing here a bit, but still quite large with last year's fifth-graders. So what's our plan? Firstly, we're, like many other schools, implementing our EL curriculum, although we're implementing in K and five, and supporting our teachers with solid professional development. This year, as Kathy described, every grade level has a weekly professional learning community meeting focused on continuous improvement by linking the needs of students with the professional learning and practice of teachers. This involves not only looking at satellite data like the MCAS data, but drilling down to MAP and street-level data. We've added daily wind blocks to our schedule where students are engaging in intervention and extension of the curriculum. We've started to share some of this street-level data with families, like our DIBLS reports, and providing ideas about how we can collaborate with families to support literacy achievement. Our second academic goal is also related to literacy, but goes a little wider to improve classroom instruction and academic rigor by using EL protocols to increase students' engagement and academic mindset. Of the students surveyed in the spring of last year, third, fourth, and fifth-grade students, only 66% reported favorably that their teacher had high or extremely high expectations of them. That was up from the previous survey. Next slide. Last year in the fall of 2022, only 54% of families responded favorably that classroom lessons were motivating to their children. We've been working to increase the use of these EL protocols, not only in the piloting classrooms for EL, but across all of our grades, as well as all of our content areas, to support deeper learning and student engagement in discussions, inquiry, critical thinking, and communication. The EL implementation has also gotten us into more peer observations. This is providing both our observing teachers and our observed teachers with the opportunity to reflect on teaching and to consider the impact of specific instructional choices on student learning. Next slide. Our third goal, our culture and climate goal, involves improving a sense of belonging for all of our students. We know that this is most urgent for our students who identify as LGBTQ+, our multilingual learners, and our students who receive services through IUPs and 504s. How did we land on this goal? Last spring, only 65% of our 3rd, 4th, and 5th graders responded favorably to feeling an overall sense of belonging at Stratton. Next slide. When we dug down a little bit deeper, we could see that almost half of our students surveyed didn't feel understood, didn't feel that the folks at Stratton understood them as a person at school. Next slide, sorry. A little bit more here. I'm not going to say much about this. Just reinforcing that sense of, first of all, it was down 8%, but also only 70%. We can go on to the next one and move it along a little bit. Then we found that similarly, the students didn't feel respected or seen by other students, not just by adults. On the next slide, this is what we're doing. We've got more work to do here, but mostly our action steps include, as you heard from my colleagues, include creating systems and structures of support. My understanding is that there was a tremendous amount of turnover in staffing at Stratton, but specifically in the SLC program. We have worked to really support the staff in that program with specialized professional development, consultation, and frankly, appreciation for the incredibly challenging work that they're doing every day. You spoke a little bit about this, but we've been working to align our social and emotional learning curriculum with our positive behavior support plan. Now we have some systems around teaching routines and expectations for our students. We have ways to celebrate and acknowledge those positive behaviors. Our next steps are to layer on specific bullying prevention and intervention curricula. Sorry, I'm not quite done there, but we've been building our affinity spaces. We spoke about the Rainbow Alliance. We also have a caregiver group of families in our SLC and a Nepali family group, which is newly formed this year. We're working toward our students and our families feeling as though they can bring their whole selves to Stratton School and feel like they belong. Next slide. Working towards improving the belonging of all families through communication, inviting the perspectives of diverse voices, and finding authentic ways for celebrating the rich diversity that exists within our school community. Stratton has a history of rich tradition, especially around certain holidays. Some of these traditions have supported all families to experience belonging, and frankly, some have not. We can see that in the next slide. In the fall of 2022, only 56% of the families who responded answered favorably that Stratton School valued students' diverse backgrounds, and only 43% responded favorably about the school valuing their opinions. Next slide. We've started to work on this goal by really trying to shift some of our celebrations to ensure that all families feel as though they are included and can participate. We are trying to build back up the engagement that so many schools are wrestling with post, well, not totally post-COVID, but post-intense COVID years. And we're doing this by trying to increase the communication frequency. I host monthly principal chats, and we're beginning to pull together some focus groups. I mentioned the SLC focus group, and we've got more focus groups on the way. I think that's it.</blockquote>

There were some pattern lanterns happening with 100 things on them. Some fun things. I've got a couple of notes here from what I've been hearing. First of all, it may not be true, but I'm really, if you're not the first group to bring a paraprofessional into your presentation, you're one of the first. And I want to, first of all, honor the district by making a commitment. Arlington Public School loves paras. We know that paras are very important for us as a district. There's a lot of value in their work, and we want to make sure that they feel appreciated and that we're treating them like the talented professionals that they are, and we're grateful for their work for us. So thank you for that inclusion in the discussion of the professional development that's being provided for your paras.</blockquote>

Could you just talk about the EL professional development that you're, like, what does that look like? So the EL curriculum, like the ELA curriculum, or multilingual? No, multilingual, yeah. Multilingual. Okay. I, like, what kind of professional development are you doing for teachers of multilingual students? Yeah, like for me or for classroom teachers that have, I don't know, the whole group, whatever you're doing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, you've been involved in our work around culturally responsive teaching. Absolutely, and the multi-tiered systems of support that we're trying to implement, and then I know on the professional development days last year, I taught an MLL PD to help general education teachers to support the students that are in their classroom. Does that answer your question?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jeff Thielman - 79</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I'm just just curious to know what the conversation is. Because, I mean, this is like, you know, it's a major challenge in our culture, right? We have a growing number of people coming into the country and the state that don't speak English. We want them to be successful in school and go into the workforce. And so, I'm just curious to know what the conversations like in the school about how to respond to those learners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could add on as a general ed teacher that has a population in my classroom that I feel like there's a strong sense of pushing into the classroom, which is supportive of my learning, how to best support them as well. Best colleague, Tiffany, works in my classroom five days a week. And I just feel like that's the best possible professional development you can get. We're working there together, co-teaching, and I'm learning, we're learning from each other, so. Good. Thanks a lot. I just, thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Morgan? Hi, great. I have a couple of things. The first one is just a comment, and I've made this to other elementary schools who have come in to talk to us. And the rollout of a new ELA curriculum is obviously like an extraordinary undertaking. It takes a lot of resources, time, mental space. I just, you know, we can't lose sight of the math, right? And it's really, really important that that's part of the conversations. I'm sure that it is, and we just get like a very quick snapshot. But you guys are, you're the 10th we've had, right? The 7th elementary school, and we've heard about EL implementation from all of them, as is appropriate. And so, you know, I just don't want us to lose sight of the math work that we need to do with students. And so, the first question that I had was, I see under the strategic academic goal two, it's talking about using the EL instructional practices. Is there any ability to use that kind of discussion about learning and how you interact with your classmates, et cetera, when we're doing math too? Like, there has to be some overlap, right?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Amy Kelly - 270</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. The, and we are talking about utilizing the EL protocols and the eight high leverage instructional practices around EL across all curricular areas. For instance, one of the EL core practices is grappling. So, we, that is, it's amazing to talk about students grappling with, kind of getting into the learning pit and really grappling in a productive struggle around learning something in math. And I feel like that's a perfect connection because we're doing that in EL and also talking about how we want students to struggle. It's not just about getting the answer quickly. It's about really grappling with new learning and, you know, that's the example that comes to mind for me. I don't know if you want to talk about other. I don't know if this came up with other schools, but while cohort one was being trained in EL, everyone else, so everyone besides two grade levels per school, were doing professional development with math, science, and social studies, thinking about how the EL protocols will apply. And we looked at all the overlap between the high leverage practices from EL and NCTM's effective teaching practices. So, things like illicit student understanding and thinking is projected one way in EL, another way in NCTM, but there's so much overlap. So, we're looking at how is that playing into our curriculum. Grappling was another one, total participation techniques. So, we hope that there'll be more and more opportunities for thinking about what's discrete about each curriculum and also how can we use what we're learning about these high leverage practices to apply across different curriculum.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Jane Morgan - 819</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, that's great. Yeah, no, it's just we sometimes don't hear about it. And so, you start, I get a little like, I get a little anxious in my heart. So, my second, I teach higher ed math and so I do a lot of work with nontraditional learners and we get them like way down the road and there's just a lot of work to be done when you're, you know, when you're an adult learner. So, the other piece of feedback that I have and I appreciate that you guys are using the data that's been sort of given to you largely. So, Dr. Ford-Walker, this may be feedback for Matt Coleman as you see fit, but I find that the way, like looking at these ELA percentages, like if I go, can you pull up the slides and go to the grade four ELA meeting or exceeding graph? So, when I like scroll through these, I get to grade four and I think to myself, holy cow, what happened in grade four last year, right? Like the achievement of high needs kids went way up from 2022 and the achievement of high needs kids like cratered out from 2022. But of course, like that's the cohort effect, right? These are not the same kids that were here. They were not in fourth grade or most, I don't think any of them were in fourth grade in both of these years, right? So, I, this one was particularly like, like my first reaction was like, up, up, keep going, keep going, keep going. Yeah, I'll tell you when. Keep going, keep going. You can talk, I'll tell her when. So, just, you know, for me, like. No, keep. Did you want math? There's no math. There's no math. One more, fourth grade. Other way. There we go, right, that one, right? So, again, it, I just, it requires a lot of mental gymnastics for me to track the cohort between these slides. And I think it was the most obvious because I'm not sure that any other school gave us three years of ELA where I could be like, oh, okay, but I was literally like making my own graph like on a Post-it note and it's like, well, because I want to understand, right? Because like 22% for high needs kids in fourth grade ELA is deeply concerning, right? I mean, and it is like fundamentally deeply concerning. They were at 35% in 2022. So, there's, there's been a decrease, but then, you know, there's also been a decrease in non-high needs kids within that cohort who were meeting and exceeding. So, like, anyway, I, we can think more about how we present this. I know that, I know that you're presenting us largely what you've been asked to or not asked to, but like, because anyway, so that for me, it was particularly glaring in this, in this presentation. And I guess the third, the third and final thing is just around family engagement. I have been a Stratton parent for 12 years. I have 80 days to go, apparently. Who knew? I do now. So, you know, I've been there for a really long time and I've seen like a lot of, a lot has changed in the 12 years that I've been there with my kids. And I think, you know, family engagement is tricky to figure out how to do that and how to do that in 2024 is certainly not what it looked like in 2012 when I started there. But, you know, I encourage you to continue to look for ways to, to, you know, when you're changing something to think about something that you can add. What can we do and how can we, you know, what can we do to bring families in to be with their kids in school in whatever way that you can? I mean, that's like parents want to go and be, I'm sure they come to your coffee chats and I'm sure that it's fantastic and a great time, but most parents want to come and be at school with their kids, right? And ways to be able to do that and engage with them in their learning is something that from my experience certainly doesn't happen in the same way that it did, you know, 10 or 12 years ago. And I appreciate that some of those things are not a good idea to keep doing, right? But I hope that as you, you know, celebrate diversity and talk to focus groups and that you think about ways to give families opportunities to participate in school with their kids, engage with their teachers because that really helps build community and resilience as, you know, as you move through all of these schools that you have. So, that's all I have. Thank you.</blockquote>

I know other schools have tried it and have had difficulty finding a time where the whole grade can set aside that time. So, where are you on that? How is it working out?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Amy Kelly - 126</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we haven't had difficulty finding a time. We have WIN every day in everyone's schedule at the same time at a grade level. So, for instance, all the third grade classrooms have WIN at the same time. We are in various stages of, it's new, right? So, we're all figuring out, I think to your point, Jane, do we spend time during WIN on math or ELA and how do you, if a student needs, requires some supports in both, how do you use that time? So, our teams have been amazing at working together to try and figure out how to utilize WIN effectively for each and every student and not only the students who require additional support but the students who need extensions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you. Ms. Sexton. Thank you. This presentation, I just want to bring up something else that we've talked about at a lot of the school improvement plan presentations and that's around chronic absenteeism. And it just wasn't mentioned at all in this, but when I look at the numbers for Stratton for low-income students and for students with disabilities, the attendance last year was concerning. And so, I'm just wondering if that's something that you have talked about as a team even though it wasn't a part of this presentation.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Amy Kelly - 152</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I've definitely talked a lot about it with my elementary principal colleagues and trying to understand how, you know, what the protocols are in terms of how do we respond and they have been incredibly helpful. Right now at Stratton, where we've been spending most of our time honestly is around foundational strategies and, you know, practices across the whole school that promote positive engagement, which ultimately should improve attendance. You know, ensuring that all of our students feel like they belong in our school and feel great about coming to school. That is, that's kind of the tier one approach, safe, safe at school, engaged in school, enjoying school, and that's really where our work has been. That's not to say that on a case-by-case basis, we're certainly addressing chronic absenteeism with families and engaging with families, but our school-wide work has been at a tier one level. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * Special Education Update 02.08.24</blockquote>

Okay. So next, we have the Special Education Program Report from Ms. Elmer. Are you pulling that up? Is that it? Okay. I was just going to try and get my copy. I was just going to try and get my copy, so. I know. All right. Thank you. So do you want to?
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Elmer - 3321</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I just wanted to position this for the group. Folks may remember that last year, we began a reorganization of the department under the Office of Student Services, which would then be overseen by an Assistant Superintendent of Student Services, and those departments include special ed, nursing, school counseling, and social-emotional learning. Can you hear me? And so primarily tonight, because you would ask for a special education update, I'll be focusing on special education, but wanted to just kind of orient the audience to what our department or who is in our department. I can advance that. And so within our special ed department, we're organized under the Assistant Superintendent, and then we have special ed coordinators who are district-level administrators. They oversee the supervision and evaluation of special educators and related service providers within the buildings, oversee implementation of special ed programming, work alongside building administrators, principals to develop and implement programming, and interview higher staff. And then we have our team chairpersons. They are within our teacher's unit, but I think most folks recognize the team chairperson as the individual who often facilitates the IEP meeting, and they are often a main point of contact for families with students who have IEPs. Can you advance that? And then just kind of a glossary of terms, because I know that in each district they're called different things, but our liaisons or learning specialists or subseparate special education teachers, those are the special educators and who deliver, you know, your classroom instruction, whether that's inclusion services, pull-out services in our SLCs, supported learning centers that you heard about. And then we have our related service providers. Those are the folks who also work in all of our buildings and fill these different roles, specialized roles that are listed there as well. And then since we have to offer a continuum of services, we do also contract for a board-certified audiologist and a teacher of the deaf and hard of hearing. We don't have enough need in the district for a full-time employee or part-time, so we do contract those services. And then we have our prayer professionals and what specialized support prayer professionals or SSPs to round out our department. Can you advance that? And so just broadly, overview of the district, we have about 1,140 IEPs, and within the district, that's 1,025. We do serve students. As I mentioned, we offer a continuum of services, so sometimes we do have to place students out of district because we don't have the services and supports that they require here. And so we do have 52 students that the district has placed in either a public day, which is our collaboratives. You're probably all familiar with the lab collaborative of which we're a member, but we do also place students in other collaboratives like Seam, Valley, et cetera. And then there are some students who are in private day placements, which are approved private special ed schools. And then we do have a small number of students who are in a residential program, and SEIS is special ed in institutional settings, so that's for students who are in the Department of Youth Services, DYS, or who may be in institutional care in one of the state hospitals. If they have IEP services, we are responsible for the provision of those as well. The other special ed program, we do also serve students who are residents of Arlington who do not attend Arlington public schools. They are privately placed at a school by their parents, so they might attend a parochial school, they may attend just an independent school. As residents of Arlington, they are entitled to their special ed services, and we do have about 60 students who do come in, what we call services only, come in for those special ed services through a drop-in model. The largest majority of those students are at the preschool. So now you may advance. And this is just a breakdown by school, the number of IEPs within the school. Monotomy is an integrated preschool, so you'll see that we have 55 students with IEPs out of the 93 students who attend our day program, which, you know, the integrated classroom should have seven students with IEPs, eight students without. So we do see higher, obviously, concentrations of IEPs at the preschool, and as I mentioned, we do serve additional students for those drop-in services. So those are students who may just come in for speech or OT. They may be in a private preschool or daycare, or they may be at home when their parents bring them in. I did put asterisks against the elementary schools that do have our supported learning centers or subseparate special ed programs, just to indicate, you know, if there's higher number of IEPs at those buildings, that's partially why. You can advance that. And just to explain the special ed programs, I think folks often don't think of the preschool as a special ed program, but that's largely why districts have integrated or public preschools, because our obligation to identify and serve students begins at the age of three. So Monotomy is our integrated preschool program. And then we have the supported learning centers. Ms. Kelly shared that they have the, what we would call the SLCA over at the Stratton. So we have, when they get to the secondary level, we switch it up on you, and we call it REACH. Similarly, the SLCB is the program we have at Dallin. And then when you get to the secondary level, that program is called Summit. And then you can advance that. As well as the SLCC, which is now, it's in its final year at Brackett. I'm going to talk a little bit more about it, and mostly over at Hardy. We started that transition two years ago. And then that becomes COMPASS at the secondary level. And previously, I had presented on this. And I'll give you an update on that. But we, the most recent program that we've developed is the SLCD, which is currently at the elementary. School at the Pierce. So since the last time I think I did this presentation, we hadn't transitioned the program over there, but we've talked about it for several years. Earlier this fall, I did do a presentation for a subcommittee, so I just wanted to include a few of the slides for folks who weren't able to attend that subcommittee presentation and just kind of give an update. But as I mentioned, we began to transition the SLCC, or the Compass Program, which serves students with intellectual disabilities, from the Brackett School to the Hardy Elementary, primarily due to space concerns and having availability of classroom and equitable classroom spaces. And we tried to do that really thoughtfully, so that's why it did take several years for us to do that transition, because we didn't want to disrupt the education of students who had been in the program at Brackett and move them, you know, in their third grade year of that. So we did start by starting students from the preschool or coming in at the kindergarten level over at the Hardy while we maintained the Brackett Program, and then as the students were aging out of the Brackett Program, we have been shifting more of the classrooms over to Hardy. So this year, we have two classrooms at Hardy, and two students remain at Brackett as fifth graders, and they will be transitioning out, and the next year, the program will exist solely at Hardy. You can advance that. Again, similarly, since I had presented last time, we did develop and implement a supported learning center over at the Pierce, the SLCD. This is primarily for students with language-based learning disabilities. So think of dyslexia, dysgraphia, and other communications disorders related to language differences. And we have that program, as you can see, began in 2021, and we have been serving a similar amount of students through that program. We initially consulted with Dr. Melissa Orkin, who was presented to you before and continues to work with the district in professional development, but in the last two years have been working directly with Landmark Consulting, which is a consulting arm of the Landmark School, which is one of those private special ed schools that specifically addresses language-based learning disabilities. I'm going to advance that. Another special ed program that we've implemented in the last two years is the MACE program, which is the Massachusetts Inclusive Concurrent Enrollment Initiative. That was passed through legislation, and so this allows students who otherwise would not receive a high school diploma to attend community colleges. Previously, we used to have students go through the MACE program through the lab collaborative. We would pay tuition to lab, and these students would then enroll in Middlesex Community College about, well, three years ago, we began to explore a direct relationship with Middlesex to have a program directly with us. And so two years ago, we did start to implement that. You can advance this. They have since passed additional legislation, which has allowed a broader range of students to participate. Now there are students who could have passed MCAS. It used to be that you couldn't pass MCAS. That was one of the criteria, that they had not passed MCAS and therefore would not earn a diploma. Now students who have passed MCAS can still participate in this program, assuming they require additional transitional supports. And so we have had two students, not the same two students, each cohort, but two students in each in the last two cohort years, and we do have an educational coach, which is essentially a paraprofessional who accompanies the students on site to the campus at Middlesex Community College and also works on travel training and whatnot. We take public transportation there, so we get to also address other transitional skills. As I mentioned, actually I believe Representative Garbally was one of the folks behind the legislation to support the expansion of the MACE programs across the state. So we were really glad to see that they have done that. And then a lot of new stuff has come up just with the opportunities around the new high school, and we're really excited about that. We did also, in partnership with that, or well, in developing the partnership with MACE, we now have a full-time transition specialist. She really led that work with MACE, and it was a teacher previously who had been kind of filling it part-time as, you know, doing direct instruction teaching and doing this transition specialist role, but she's now full-time, and it's really led to, again, the creation of a young adult living seminar. She serves as a liaison to the adult service agencies and will be, as we continue to expand now with the new high school, developing more of the programming that we have for activities of daily living, community partnerships for employment opportunities. Those things are all in the pipeline. And as we've expanded the COMPASS program at the high school to include students to the ages of 18 to 22 when special ed entitlement ends in Massachusetts, we've, you know, identified areas of need for training. So we've been training folks in RAVO, which is one of the explicit reading interventions, as well as we now have reading specialists at the high school that can also deliver Orton-Gillingham. We've been working, the math coaches have been working with our special ed teams at Audison and at the high school to align our math curriculum around more of those personally relevant academics, which you would, in the past, might call functional academics, but those are things related to budgeting, making, depending on the student, making change or creating a personal budget, things like that. And we've also implemented a social boundaries curriculum called the Circles Curriculum. As I said, with the new high school, with most of the project done for special ed, we have a lot of new opportunities. The student cafe and print shop are going to give us opportunities for job skills as well as the kitchen facilities that we now have. And one of the really cool features that we were able to put into the design of the building and work with the architects around was a apartment classroom. So it is a classroom that is designed to be like an apartment so that you can, you know, learn about making your bed, you know, dishes. We've had to purchase a lot of things like plates and silverware so that you can, you know, practice loading the dishwasher, putting things away, making your bed, things like that, doing laundry. And then you already saw the monotony preschool when we opened it in January. It's just a beautiful space. But it also, we saw the return of the, we've always had the early childhood class working with monotony, but now they have a classroom within monotony so that they can, you know, do their class work as well as intern in our preschool classrooms. And just the space itself was allowed for really state of the art related services. You can see our OT space, our physical therapy space, as well as our related service providers speech and social work having their own dedicated spaces. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunity that's in the new preschool. Additionally, you know, you've heard folks talk about the implementation or the adoption of expeditionary learning from special ed. We, you know, many of us were part of that literacy selection team. And some of the, what are now district-wide programs like Hagerty was previously a special ed intervention for phonemic awareness. Now that that's district-wide, something that we have been working with our colleagues on, especially including the expansion of foundations to third grade, as well as implementing those double screeners across. Also, I really do see that partnership that we've had with general ed in making these changes for the whole district. Since 19-20, school year 19-20, we've been able, through grant funds, to train 30 educators, special educators in Orton-Gillingham, which is an extensive training program. And then an additional 13 have been certified. They have to complete a year-long practicum at the associate's level. And there's another six who are currently completing it this year so that they will have the associate's level certification as well. And then you heard in public comment about our QBS training. So just to give a little bit of background around QBS, the state does require that we have restraint and de-escalation prevention training. And at its core, QBS and all of the programs are a de-escalation training program. So we're trying to prevent the need to go hands-on. We are a low-incidence district when it comes to administering restraints. One of the things that we, when we were exploring the transition from TCI, Therapeutic Crisis Intervention, which we had previously been implementing, we began this process two years ago when we were looking across the state to see what other folks were using. Of the 75 districts that we were able to get in contact with, 40 of those districts used QBS or safety care, with the other ones primarily using TCI, which we were using, and CPI, Crisis Prevention Intervention. So those are the three big providers. Western Mass has another program called CALM. Not many folks on the eastern part of the state use that program. I do think that it's a bit of a misnomer to imply that it was, it is applied behavioral analysis. It's based in the principles of applied behavioral analysis, which, yes, when we initially, we as a country, LOVAS, back in the 20s and 30s, implemented applied behavioral analysis, there was a heavy component of punishment and positive reinforcement, and very strict and explicit principles of ABA, which are often part of what we would call discrete trials, point in a picture, receive a reinforcement, point at the wrong picture, you know. So that has shifted over the last 80 years, where ABA is much broader than that. QBS itself, specifically, is based on the principles of positive reinforcement and is tied to, as I said, mainly preventing and avoiding restraint. So the biggest number of folks have actually taken the verbal de-escalation training, which, in its own description, right, focuses on verbally de-escalating a student. That's what we've had the most folks in the district trained in, and so I'm happy to answer any questions about that. I do have a few more slides, though, if you want to advance them. I did mention, you know, briefly that health and nursing is also within the department, so just wanted to kind of show you how that department is organized. You can advance that. Just some of the things that the nursing department is working on. We have a grant through the Affiliate Comprehensive School Health Services Program, and we're continuing to do that. I believe we're in our second year of that. We are piloting this year's SNAP, which is the electronic health records, but there's a portal for families, so Bishop and, I believe, Gibbs have been piloting that this year for rollout for next year for all families. We are continuing to participate in the University of Connecticut Child Anxiety Learning Modules Study. You see public, you see us advertising all the time that we are offering vaccine clinics, and not just for COVID, but flu as well, and then they, similarly, too, the nursing department has been really excited about the new spaces that have been available to us in the new high school as well as monotony preschool. You want to advance that? And then the final department, I think you will be hearing from Magali Olander in the spring about SEL and counseling. If you remember, Ms. Olander was the interim director last year, and she's now, this year, been our full-time director after a thorough search last spring to identify a permanent director. We're super excited that Magali is in this role with us. This is also that department and how it breaks out. Do you want to advance the slides? And the things that SEL and counseling department are working on at the elementary level, they're working really closely with the school social workers and the multi-tiered systems of support. You heard a little bit about this, supporting SEL and mental health, both the curricula and our screeners, as well as Simone Cortava is our SEL specialist, and she is also working with the teams implementing EL. We have been administering the universal mental health screeners. This year, we previously did grades three through 12. This year, we're doing four through 12 based on feedback from both the staff administering it and teachers, just around how valid and reliable the information we were getting from third graders were as far as being able to ask the questions that these screeners do of those students. This year was the return of youth mental health first aid. During COVID, youth mental health first aid had shifted a lot to online, delivering that training. This year, we have, under our SAMHSA grant, we are able to have a youth mental health coordinator who is training, you've probably seen announcements, she's trained both school staff as well as community members in youth mental health first aid. And then this spring, we will be offering healing centered engagement certifications for our faculty and students. Tonight, I just plug, but it's already passed, but tonight there was one of our parent offering was the Trails Suicide Awareness and Prevention that was earlier this evening that families had an opportunity to engage in.</blockquote>

My experience as a principal and administrator is that because special education is done on the basis of a collection of IEPs, individual education plans, that they are all very individual and that if you're looking at things systemically, I can take a look at third grade performance, I could take a look at how the athletic teams are doing. There are a lot of things that I can get my hands on, but the relationship between district, family, kid, within that structure of IEPs is very difficult for us to get our handle on. Now I know that this district has a reputation in the past for being particularly difficult to deal with. Twenty years ago, and I'm really going back in time, the state was really not very enamored with us. And poor Mr. Thielman had to go to Malden in order to receive a scathing report. And we've certainly made a lot of progress over the past time. But still, from this seat, it's very difficult for us to measure, document, and talk about the progress we're making. Let me probe a little in that how do we, as a committee and communicating as a community, indicate the progress. Because what we're talking about within the metrics in the strategic plan, we acknowledge this takes time and considerable resources, but our commitment is to transforming, transforming because we're not there yet, the Arlington Public Schools into a system that eliminates opportunity gaps, thereby allowing all students to thrive while pacing benchmarks to reflect ambitious and attainable progress. And we can take a look at MCAS scores, that doesn't really tell us where we're at in this. If we reverse positions and you're in the school committee and you were looking for metrics that we could use to evaluate and demonstrate to the community that we're making progress according to what we say we're going to do, how would we do that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there's a couple of things we could look at, and I acknowledge, I think that districts in general have this challenge, as you said, that they are individuals. So students, when you have an individual education program, a student is, our job is to set reasonably ambitious, yet achievable goals in which the individual can achieve within a year, right? So a student receives a progress report against their individual IEP goals, at least if- And these are not public documents, so these are- Right, exactly. They receive those progress reports at least as frequently as a non-disabled peer gets a report card. So generally, three times a year, if there's four report cards, it's four times a year. At the preschool, we have two report cards, so they get those. So there's that, and as you've mentioned, yes, MCAS is one measure. We do look at student with disability, that category for achievement data, I think we've started to, and appreciated Mr. Coleman and Dr. Ford-Walker's analysis. I think that we haven't really broken it down previously to that degree. I do think we have other data sets as we look at the DIBLs and the literacy screening that we can start to track that. As I was mentioning with those department highlights, I do think the adoption of things like the EL curriculum, I don't think it's a secret that as special educators, we were pretty critical of the Lucy Calkins curriculum. We were some of the early adopters around the science of reading as far as training our staff and having PD around that, and I also mentioned expanding those previous special ed interventions like Hegarty to the general public. That's how I think we eliminate, reduce opportunity and achievement gaps, the idea that the rising tide raises all ships. I do think that the stuff that works for our students, students with disabilities, are the things that are good practices for everybody, so I'm optimistic that our theory of action to close that gap is to implement curricula that is universally designed, that is multi-sensory, that is systematic in its approach, and I think we have a long way to go. You had pointed out, to Ms. Kelly, the gaps between that high-needs group of which students with disabilities are part of that group, so I don't think I specifically gave you  an answer, but, you know, I'm curious what you folks would like to see or what you think would be helpful.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do we measure parent satisfaction? I mean, we get it randomly. I mean, we talk to people, and I've got a range of people that range from very unhappy to very satisfied, and, you know, it's not a systemic thing. I'm sure with IEPs, it's all a very individual thing that you've got this parent who's unhappy, this parent who's just thrilled. How do we get a handle on it?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Elmer - 223</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So we have two, yeah, we have a couple of measures, those more qualitative measures. So Panorama does start to separate out students with disabilities, so those caregivers can indicate, you know, that they have a child with disabilities, so we have that data source. We do, at the conclusion of each IEP meeting, or we send it with the paperwork, we do send a survey to gain feedback on how they felt, you know, they were heard at the team meeting, was there participation? Like, I will say, since we shifted to more online meetings during COVID, and then once we could come back in person, people didn't want to, surprisingly. A lot of families opted, I think, you know, for the convenience of not having to leave work and being able to log on to an IEP meeting rather than taking half a day to come back and meet in person. I've seen fewer of those folks responding to that survey, and I don't know if that's just a product of you're not there in person and someone has handed it to you, even if you receive it electronically. And the other thing is the CPAC will be presenting to you this spring. The last three years now, they have been collecting, we've partnered with them around a parent survey.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, and I know that a lot of the positions are challenging to fill, particularly the ones that you have responsibility for. Are we meeting the needs with our staffing? Are we budgeted to meet the needs? Do we have a gap in terms of our ability to attract the employees we need? And do you have enough administrative staff to do all the work you need to do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we are very appreciative of the override, because I do think that will help us to have, the plan is, I think, to put most of that money towards competitive salaries. I do think that will assist us with this. We have noticed a shift since COVID, that positions that were more easily filled, and you're right, in special ed, they aren't easily filled often, but our related service providers usually were. Because those are, I don't think folks realize, if you become a speech and language pathologist, you can work at the clinic at MGH, or you can work in a public school, right? If you're an OT, you've gone through the same training that the folks at Spaulding have gone through, right? You're just delivering those services in the school setting, and that used to be really attractive to a lot of those folks. I think telehealth opportunities for a lot of providers has changed things, whereas maybe that school-based position isn't as attractive as it once was, as far as salaries and the hours and the schedule used to be. I think we were getting more folks the last few years. We've seen smaller numbers of applicants for those related service providers, though I am optimistic, I'm looking at Rob and folks who are on the negotiation committee, that with increased salaries, that we can be more competitive. I'm certainly hopeful that our para salaries will also, that had been the hardest position to fill. We continue to rely on agencies, which obviously cost us much more, right? We are essentially paying someone else to find the employee, and they're charging us a higher rate than if we paid the person directly. So I'm optimistic that with the new para salaries, that we will be able to get more of those people directly, and they'll be our permanent employees rather than year-long employees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Thank you. More questions? So Massachusetts issued a new IEP form. I know it might not be in the software yet, but do we have any thoughts about rolling that out or not rolling that out?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Elmer - 463</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone will be required to roll it out in September. So this year we have been, starting in the fall, I believe it was the beginning of October, we sent a team of our team chairs, coordinators and myself, to the states training for that. Our third-party provider, PCG, EZIEP that we use, has not yet completed that software. I will say that I don't know that anyone, I believe Aspen is the first one to actually have it electronically, and they just started to roll it out because Lexington is anticipating doing it in this February, but they've been waiting. So we will be training our staff this spring, and then having trainings for families as well, but across the state we will be using the new IEP format. And there are changes to what it looks like. I think that will look different to people. There is an emphasis on student input into it in a way that I think at the secondary level we always have had, so that won't be much of a shift for teams, but even at the preschool level they want to have input from the student about what their goals and objectives for themselves, in developmentally appropriate ways, are for the next three to five years, as well as the way in which just portions of the IEP are broken out, and I could just start going off on acronyms and people won't know what they mean, but looking at accommodations just differently how they're laid out, as well as what we call the present levels of educational performance, those are big shifts, and a real focus on the data collection piece for monitoring progress I think are some of the biggest shifts in that, and it just physically looks different. I hate showing you something that's landscaped instead of portrait, but that layout, it is meant to also be more, to increase compliance not in a, so if someone has, if a student has, their qualifying disability is autism, there's required paperwork that has to be completed as part of the process. This system will now, if you select autism as a disability, it will automatically populate these forms for you, so there's no way that someone can, oh, we forgot to do that form. If you have a specific learning disability, there's required forms. The design of the software is such that once you select specific learning disability, those required forms will be there. A student who's over 14 has to do transition planning, but if it's students 10, then you won't even see those. Like currently now, you all get the same form, right? So it will be more geared toward the individual student. Great. Thank you. Any more questions? Ms. Gittleson?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi. Thank you. So I just wanted to give you an opportunity, Dr. Elmer, to answer the question that Ms. Gellick asked during public comment about how does the district meet its obligations under child find?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Elmer - 378</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. And I feel like I always have to say this. I'm Ms. Elmer, although my mother would be very happy if I had that doctorate. So child find, for folks who aren't familiar with the terminology, is the district's affirmative responsibility to locate and identify students with disabilities for evaluate, possibly disabilities for evaluation. So we do that in a number of ways. You will see on our website are what we call our child find notice that tells you if you suspect that your child has a disability, here's who to contact for an evaluation. We participate in a early childhood network here in town so that all of the private preschools I mentioned, we have students from private preschools coming in for special ed services so that they're aware of if you are seeing a student that are a child in your preschool program that you have concerns about with the family, direct them to the school district because you are eligible starting at the age of three to be evaluated for services. We do share that with the doctor's offices, the pediatrician's offices. We'll often get referrals from them as well as we publicly post it. It's actually no longer required, but we still do that. I don't know if people read the newspaper, but we do publicly post it in the newspaper every year as well and offer screenings throughout the year at the preschool. And then what we also have is our proportionate chair, our equitable services meeting three times a year, and that's where we actually meet with the private preschools here in town, so the private schools here in town, sorry, St. Agnes, Arlington Catholic, Leslie Ellis, and New Covenant, and also share our child find obligations to let them know if you have, if you're suspecting or you have families in your, to refer them to us. So child find requires us to evaluate. I do want to make sure that, you know, there may be, you can be evaluated for a disability, you may have a disability, you may not be eligible for special ed services based on the determination of the team, but that child find obligation is to do the evaluation, it's not to determine eligibility.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. I also wanted to ask a little bit about, so this is my first year hearing your report on the school committee, and I learned a lot about the different SLCs, but I did sort of find it kind of glaringly obvious that there are no, there are no SLCs for sixth graders. And so, you know, in particular, I guess I'm wondering what the thoughts are of the district about particularly with the SLCD that's at Pierce for those fifth graders as they transition into the Gibbs, how are their needs going to get met? And then more broadly, how does that, the lack of the, those SLCs at the, at that level, it just seems like it would, it would make what is often a difficult transition for kids and kids who are, you know, have extra challenges, it would make it even, it could make it even more difficult. So I'd like to hear your thinking about that.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? Elmer - 536</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. So I do want to clear that up. So we talked about this when we initially were exploring the options of whether we were going to create a standalone sixth grade school, or we were going to create a smaller middle school when the Audison was reaching its capacity. So by going to a one-year only school, we identified early on that what we lose is those economies of scale, right? At the elementary school, the cohorts run from five, from fifth grade down to kindergarten, right? So we can group students within a program, similarly at Audison, you know, you can have seventh and eighth graders at the time, sixth, seventh, and eighth graders to create cohorts. When you go to a one-year model, we lose that large cohort because you might have one student coming out of Gallen SLCB, you might have three students coming out of Stratton's SLCA, vice versa, right? And each year, that number, that, that, both that number and that, that grouping of students, right, is going to change. So the next year, it could be the Compass Program is sending more students, right? So what we have to do is, it's not that we don't have programming to meet those students' needs, what we do is a lot of planning. So beginning at the end of February and in March, what we do is the fifth grade teams from each of the elementary schools meet individually with the Gibbs team, and we go over all the IEPs coming out of that school. So all the fifth grade IEPs coming out of the Gallen. We look at what services the student currently has and what they require. So we look and say, does a student receive small group ELA instruction because they're significantly behind grade level and they're working on personally relevant academics, and perhaps that's a student coming out of the SLCC or, you know, the Program for Students with Intellectual Disabilities, or is that student receiving small group instruction because they have an emotional impairment and being in a large classroom is really overwhelming, distracting, or perhaps they are at grade level but they are in the SLCA and, you know, that environment is overstimulating and so they receive small group instruction. So we do that for all of the students coming out of fifth grade. Generally it's about 90 students we've been averaging who have IEPs each year at the Gibbs program and then we start to build the programming and build the schedules. So if we need, you know, small group math for, as I said, for grade level but they need small group, then we build that into the schedule and programming. If there's a second group that needs small group math because they're significantly below grade level, then we build that into the programming. So there is sub-separate programming. There could be a student who receives all small group instruction at the Gibbs. There could be students who receive a combination of small group, ELA, and social studies but then are in co-taught or in, you know, just full inclusion general ed class for math and sciences. It's really individual to the student.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Any more questions? Ms. Morgan. Can I just ask a follow-up question on Ms. Goodall? So when you talked about obligations under child find, you talked about kids before they come to kindergarten, right, like preschools and stuff. But that obligation to do child find doesn't stop when they turn five. We're obligated to find them the whole time.</blockquote>

So we are there. That's three times a year. The next one's coming up at the end of February, I believe. And we explain that child find obligation. Any parent who is a resident of Arlington, also like I said, it's on our website. If you, you know, we receive notification from right over the street, the International Baccalaureate School, they will refer students back to us if they're residents of Arlington for evaluation. So we do continue that throughout.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. So while our students in APS, I mean, they're being constantly seen by teachers. And so we are looking at our grade level, our ACE meetings, which are those grade level data meetings. We have our SST, which is the student support team where a teacher may bring an individual student that they are, you know, struggling to meet their needs and problem solve around that. That's part of our multi-tiered systems of support. We also implement our literacy screeners to see who is performing well below grade level to identify them for intervention. So those are all part of our child find obligation. Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kate Perez - 2945</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you so much. And thank you for the time to be here tonight to talk a little bit about the kinds of things that I've been working on this year. I think that it's been this really wonderful opportunity to work more systemically on some of the issues that challenge us. And I really have appreciated the ability to work across the district with our building leaders and all of our educators, not just in a building-based way, but thinking about the equitable ways that we can put processes in place to help support our staff specifically from my perspective this year. And so as I go through this, it's been interesting because it's not something, it's not a role that we've had before. And so it has really come directly from some of the things that we have in our strategic plan and is very much this crossover between HR and teaching and learning and really this, the ways in which we're trying to continue a lot of the good things that we're doing within Arlington Public Schools and meet the needs also of, you know, expectations of the state and DESE. And it really started in the summer with building those relationships with our new administrators. So the first slide is titled Building Relationships because that was a lot of the summer work. We had 14 new administrators who came into Arlington Public Schools this year. That includes principals, assistant principals, directors, special education coordinators, and central office staff too. And so there was a great deal of history and information that needed to be shared with people about all of our technical processes and the ways in which we do things, but also really just making sure that that personal welcome was there. You know, that there was someone to greet them and say, you know, we really are happy that you're here and we want to make sure that you do your best. And so part of that really was also the introduction to the strategic plan and really just assistance with summer tasks. And so that I was uniquely prepared to do that as an administrator myself in Arlington for the four or five years previous to that. So we can go on to the next slide. One of the things that, and it's been touched on quite a lot already, is this idea of hiring and being able to have the staff and the ways in which we draw our staff into the system. And so we've been working on a lot of things to do this, and especially within that area of the paraprofessionals. And we've talked already quite a lot about the paraprofessionals tonight. And so this is just a snapshot of some of the things that we've been trying to do. In the summer, we were able to have a hiring fair, and it was a very collaborative effort in order to try. And so this is just a snapshot of some of the things that we've been trying to do. In the summer, we were able to have a hiring fair, and it was a very collaborative effort  to draw people in. And so not necessarily just paraprofessionals, but all our support staff. So thinking about people who work within our food services, the paraprofessionals on all levels, but also connecting with people who perhaps are in some of those harder to place roles, some of them certified staff as well. And so really being able to put that human into the human resources was helpful this summer. So we have had job fairs in the past in APS and our turnout has been limited. And I think that the numbers were much higher this year because we did work together with all of our different departments, including communication and got it out there that we could do some hiring on the spot, dependent on background checks and things like that, of course, but that personal outreach really brought people in. And so I think that being able to make sure that we're really front loading with this, these are the things that make Arlington Public Schools special. This is what's going to set us apart from our neighbors who are all going through all of the same things. And so we were able to hire quite a few people that summer based on that kind of personal outreach. And it came from that. A lot of it was really just that working together to make sure that we were casting a wide net. On the next slide, the onboarding piece of what I've been doing has been really something that was putting a lot of very strong or trying to put a lot of very strong systems into place. So, and I should say just in general that a lot of the things that I'll touch on this evening in these presentations are things that we've been working on in Arlington Public Schools for a long time. We have a very strong HR department. We have a very strong teaching and learning department. Working together with all of our building leaders has always been a strength in Arlington. But I think that what we know and see is that there are taxes on the system that make it very hard for people to do those things that they know are good practice. And so as we do the work through the course of the year, really putting those systems into place and documenting them in ways and getting feedback on how they're working so that we will have sustainable plans going forward into the future. And they hit these different categories, pre-boarding, orientation as a part of onboarding, building those strong foundations. This will include mentoring and creating buddy systems and also professional learning and training because we don't want to confuse the ideas of what is orientation, which is really just this kind of one time, maybe a day or two in which we get the paperwork and the basic structures of you coming on to our system, benefits, et cetera, in place. But then onboarding is really something that is ongoing over the course of a year, two years, sometimes even three years of time. And it's something that we have done really well for our certified staff, for our teachers and special education, all of the people who are working under licenses here in APS. That mentoring system is really strong, that training and development has been something that's been developed and is ongoing for a long time. However, when it comes to some of these other positions that are really critical to the work that we're doing, there's much less attention paid. And so that might include paraprofessionals, but I also want to be very careful to say that a lot of those people are within our special education department. And you just heard from Ms. Elmer, all of the things that have happened that are trainings with paraprofessionals over the years. So a lot of when I speak about this, it's about creating those equitable structures for everyone over all of our spaces. Next slide, please. And what I've really learned is that those first 30 days of your time in a space are critical. And when we talk to people about their experiences, they're really basic, not very hard questions that they should be able to answer. And so it's interesting that if they can't, right? And so the five questions, and so I didn't make these up, this comes from my research and from working with organizations specifically within the HR realm is like, what do we believe in around here? Well, we have this beautiful strategic plan that we worked on quite and got a lot of input on. So that's something that people should know. And not just that, but what's the culture in your school setting? What is your role here? What are the expectations of your role? Do you really know what it is expected of you? Do you get feedback from the people that work with you? What are your strengths? What are the things you need to work on? Who are your partners? That was a big piece of what happened when I spend time talking to people coming in over the summer, especially is like, who do I work with? Who do I talk to? If I have a question about this, who do I ask? And so that seems like it should be something that's simple to have in place. And sometimes it's just not so much, right? And so we've been working on that. And then also, what does my future here look like? And if people can answer those kinds of basic questions about their work, then they're much better able to engage in that work and stay. Because as been already mentioned too, is that the turnover that we see, especially in roles like paraprofessionals, it's expensive. And as we are constantly, constantly getting new people into the system and training them, we don't have those people who are well-trained and settled within our system working with our students. So there's definitely statistics. And I don't need to bore you with all of them. But one really good one that comes up again and again is that a great onboarding experience can improve employee retention by 82% and productivity by over 70%. And that's something that I've seen in lots of different places. Highly engaged employees are 87% less likely to leave their employer. So that's why onboarding is important. The next slide, please. So again, there has been professional development and professional learning for our paras for many years. But again, I think that the key here is additional work and support for them, adding more to that experience and making it consistent. And I've spent a great amount of time doing interviews with individuals and with groups to find out some of the things that people are really looking for in that role. And so the differentiation of it is something that feels important to people. Being able to have choice feels very important. Having it be hands-on and personalized. People don't wanna spend a lot of time on Zoom calls, we found out. And then also being able to really spend time in their schools with the people that they work with. Paraprofessionals are often people who are following a very busy schedule and don't necessarily cross paths with each other or with the people who are their supervisors as much as they would like. And so we've spent time adding more, and you'll see on this slide, there are more opportunities for our paras during our choice professional learning sessions that happen on Wednesdays in three- and six-session courses. We've added additional times that weren't there before. Celebrations of our paras, where you see the great sticker that we got from our Teaching and Learning Department. APS loves paras. And also being able to just bring them together for the elementary and the middle level training opportunities on early release conference days. And there's some agendas linked in there if you're interested in what that looked like. Much more collaboration with administrators and with people within special education to really pinpoint what they're seeing on the ground and what we need to do in real life to help support the individuals who are working with our students. The interest that is coming from that paraprofessional group is a lot more that has to do with social-emotional learning. Things like responsive classroom, which we've been given some more information on that. I just had a class that I taught yesterday, early release PD on some of responsive classroom practices, and it really overlapped quite a lot with other SEL approaches, and it went really well. We're also doing kind of nuts and bolts things, like creating a paraprofessional guidebook. That's happening with substitute teachers as well, being able to share the guidebook for the substitutes so they know what to expect. And other things as well that you can see that are included on this slide. The next slide is just some pictures, right, from town hall. I don't know if you heard this, but that big meeting of all the elementary pairs, there are a lot of them. So we needed to find a good big space for them. And then also in a very old-school way, you might see that we collected some feedback. We've noticed that there are some challenges for our pairs in accessing some of the work that we would like to do. For example, it was easier to get everybody to write their feedback on a sticky note at town hall than it was to send a form in a Google form, because sometimes the ability to access things on the computer is not as easy for our pairs as it might be for others, and we see that as a challenge area, that we need to work on that for them. Next slide. A big piece of what we're working on is mentoring. So DESE has requirements for principal induction and mentoring, and there are rubrics that have come from the state. And so that's something that has been in place in Arlington in the past as new administrators come into their work here, as it has been in other districts in which there were mentor match-ups. So having a mentor is not a new thing. But being able to work with the rubrics and being able to have that induction process be something that has a specific focus on equity and really anti-racist practices in schools is a somewhat new thing. And it's something that not just Arlington, but all of our neighboring districts are working on as well. And I'm feeling great about this collaboration with CLEE, if you go to the next slide. As Dr. Ford-Walker mentioned, we have been able to connect ourselves to a grant with CLEE, the Center for Leadership and Educational Equity. You might know them as, they've been rebranded, but this is the organization that has the protocols, the School Reform Initiative. Originally, way back when it started at Brown University, they are based in Rhode Island, but they worked with DESE to help write the rubrics for the Principal Induction Program. And so they really know where we're going with this. And so they have a two-year seed grant through the federal government, and we were able to get into that. And so the work that we're doing for mentoring is free to APS, so we like free. And the point is to create the mentoring system, the induction program, and be able to do that in a way that is sustainable over time. And so we have partnerships this year working together. The mentor administrator and the mentee administrator have been working with coaches through CLEE, doing online work through Canvas, and also having peer-to-peer sessions with the whole cohort that is part of this. There are about 12 different towns that are doing it. And next year, the new administrator will become the mentor and will be pulling in, hopefully, we're working on this right now, I actually was just at a meeting this afternoon about this, a teacher leader or someone who's interested in becoming a principal, or just interested in leadership in general. So hopefully that system will continue over time. I hope I've described that well. And there are stipends for our mentors, and so that's great. Next one. So ELAP is the name of this program. It's the Equity Leader Accelerator Program, and it really is something that is focused on how do we come together to really work on the problems that a lot of us are facing. It's not APS-specific that there are opportunity gaps and that there are needs that have to do with making sure that we have equitable practices and anti-racist practices in our schools. So next slide. I also fill my days really staying very connected to the schools, and just in case you're wondering, I sometimes act as like almost the principal sub, right? So I do some coverage from time to time. And I also have been very open to being there to support administrators as they've asked for it. I've done a lot of thought partnership and support with school improvement planning. I am helping to co-facilitate part of the strategic plan, one of the working groups, 2.2. I have really enjoyed being a member of the ILT at Gibbs. We started this year, and I know you'll hear much more about it, a residency program with our DEIBJ department, which we started at Gibbs just recently. Hiring is ongoing, substitutes specifically in paraprofessionals all through the year, and onboarding people as they go into their roles in the middle of the year. I talked about the creation of the guidebooks for many kinds of staff and the facilitation of the responsive classroom class. So those are just some of the things. Next slide. Looking ahead, working with CLEE certainly, but also really thinking about the development of the documents and how they're going to be something that people are using, like we're trying things, we're testing them out, we're asking how it's going, but coming into some more committee-like work possibly as we solidify things before the end of the year. I mean, just continuously collecting that feedback. So those are some of the high points, and any questions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I, as Ms. Parrott. No, I mean, this is not a criticism. No, I know, as Ms. Parrott said, we identified gaps. I mean, I think it was one of the reasons we created this position for this year, because we do have some gaps in our onboarding, especially as we were looking at new administrators and paraprofessionals, and how can we develop better systems for that? Because we have had a very strong educator, teacher mentoring program for years, and we wanted to sort of see what can we do, and we did, you know, there has been turnover in paraprofessionals, so it was something that was kind of done at the school level, and we would identify mentors for new administrators coming in, sometimes they were retired principals that we would contract with to provide mentorship, but this has become much more of an organized focus of the district this year, I think, through Kate's leadership.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right, and it's in your department, right? Well, we share, it's a combination of HR and teaching and learning. Well, I just want to say, I just want to, I think it's a really important thing, because what happens when you go into any administrative position or principal position, you're not getting good help on logistics and procedures and how things work, you just call up another principal and bug them. Yes. That may have happened to you. Yes. So I'm really glad this is here. So I just want to say I'm pleased that we're doing this. It's really necessary to have a good functioning district this size. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More questions? Mr. Schliffman. Yeah, I mean, I agree. This is one of those positions we've needed for a long time, and we're seeing growth now because, well, one of the things is when Mr. Thielman and I both came on the committee originally, we were a district of about 4,200 kids. Now we're over 6,000, and the administrative structure did not keep up with the growth, both in the number of students and the demands that we have under ed reform and increased curriculum needs, so that as we're bringing in new people and redefining roles, it's been critical that we're filling gaps, major gaps that we've had. And one of the things that I've found from talking to folks who are new to the district is that we're viewed as a welcoming district. I know that principals have worked well together in this district in the past, and building upon those relationships to bring in more people and create an even bigger community and move some of the district administrative tasks away from the principals and place them here in central office is very important. So I'm very appreciative that you've transitioned from being a building leader in the district to supporting building leaders in this district and the other staff. The one question I have is that we've done a lot of outreach for all sorts, and maybe Rob is the person to ask too, but when I first, when I was teaching, I was working for a principal who was a METCO parent. She was a METCO parent, and her kid was in Arlington. So I'm wondering what kind of connections we're making with our METCO families that would support drawing them into this community, because I know that there are a lot of educators who live in Boston that are involved in METCO and could be a resource. for us beyond what we can possibly contemplate.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kate Perez - 422</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I think that's a really good thing to be thinking about, and I think it has to do with how do we set ourselves apart from other communities, because there are certain things that we can do that are really critical, like pay and benefits and all of those things that we need that we know are the obvious things, but then we also have to really think about like what is our vision and mission and all the things that we're talking about, how is it alive here in Arlington, and how does that set us apart? So as we continue to do this work of equity across our district, I think that's what people are going to start to see, is that this isn't just another thing that people in APS are talking about, this lives and breathes in everything that we do. And so when we look at these really solid curricular practices, when we look at this really high quality education that we're giving to all of our students, not just some of them, then I think that that is really going to start to be a truly strong selling point for Come to APS, and we will start to see a more diverse, you know, we talk about wanting our students to be able to see themselves reflected in our staffing, and we don't really have that right now, and so I think we can start to build that when we really do have a community that believes in equity and shows it and calls it out when it's not happening, and says we're working really hard to put in place things that will make this a better, stronger plan for everyone. And I think it's sort of an expectation that we should have, or any district should have, is that if we have a diverse student population, our ability to hire from that group is, that generation is moving forward, that they come back and want to be here is an important component. I want to see, it's sort of a family thing, that people feel compelled to come back, and I know it's difficult now because of housing costs and competitive salaries and how the teaching profession is not keeping up with other professions in terms of salary compensation benefits. But, you know, I hope that the community that we're building here among the students also then will populate the community that we're bringing in as staff members four years after they graduate.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 223</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I think I would just add to that a little bit about the ways in which we connect with the staff members once they're here. Because I think that we have had times in which we've brought a more diverse staff member into our community, and they haven't actually stayed. And so I think that we can continue to put things in place in which we're connecting with those people, again, on a very human level, to say, doing things that are perhaps interviews or check-ins or, you know, and maybe it's working with our administrators on some training on how to do this, but so that we can adjust and try to really have, like, midstream, we can continue to adjust and change our practices. Like, it doesn't always have to start in September on the first day. Like, we have to be more fluid in our responses to the needs of our staff. It's not easy being alone or a visible minority within a community, and that's a really challenging thing for us to confront in terms of really making it a welcoming and supportive community beyond our good intents. But I appreciate the focus you're bringing to this position, and I've seen the need for it for a long time, and I'm glad you're doing it. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. So can you speak at all to, so in the more sort of, like, practical, right? I work with a lot of educators, and we talk a lot about, you know, setting really clear expectations for performance right from the beginning, because it's so much easier to be consistent from the beginning than to go and fix it later, because it's kind of confusing when you don't address it at the beginning, and you come back later and say, well, actually, we really don't like that. So it's always easier to do it, sort of, start as, you know, as you intend to go on. And I guess, in your conversations with a lot of our new principals, is that sort of sense of being really clear about expectations around performance, and, you know, especially for paraprofessionals, who, for some of them, you know, it's not, it may be their first job, or in their first five jobs, right? Is that something that you've talked to new principals about, and is there anything sort of high-level that you can share about any takeaways from that?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kate Perez - 753</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the work with the principals specifically? Yeah, yeah. Well, so what we're really lucky about is that our new administrators are not new to administration. Right. And so we've been incredibly fortunate this year to have these wonderful, you know, intelligent, creative people who've come on, because they're bringing experiences from their other districts that they've already been very successful in. And so, and Amy Kelly is a perfect example, is that she's someone who came from another district, and she did a lot of work with paraprofessionals, and their training in her previous district. And so I think pulling on their experiences has really been a highlight of what we're trying to do here, and has really helped to support our planning. But yes, we talk about it. Because I think that it also kind of goes back to that other question is like, who was doing all this work before? Right, well, who was doing it is like all the administrators who were here, right? And so the building principals, and the, you know, special ed coordinators, and directors, and all of those people. But I think that there's only so much we can put on people. Like there's only so much you can be responsible for. And I think sometimes, unfortunately, what happens is as our building, and I can speak to this because I was the principal at Hardy, right? So I know how that went is that when you only have so many, you know, hours in your day, there are sometimes things that fall by the wayside. And so that person who is the paraprofessional who you just managed to hire, who's starting in November, and there hasn't been anybody there before. And, you know, let's be honest, five years ago, that person might have been a certified teacher who was just trying to get their foot in the door, and it wasn't as big a problem because they had training. But now these people that are coming in, and Allison talked about the agency, like the agencies aren't bringing us like a higher quality of, and I shouldn't, now she's looking at me like, don't say that, but it's true. She's not really, I'm teasing. I'm teasing, I'm teasing. But that it's not that these aren't good, strong people coming in to do their work. They're people who haven't had the same amount of experience as maybe we might've been used to in the past. And it's our responsibility to make sure they have what they need in order to do what's best for our students. And so when there's 1,001 things happening during the day as a building principal, it can be hard to have that be the, you know, thousands and second thing that you have to do. And so I think it really is important that we support our leaders in this work. And so we do, we talk about it a lot and trying to think about sustainable practices that will help to get that put in place. And sometimes it might be, you know, solutions that have to do with technology, like some kinds of training could happen in a system in which people could be able to look at some of those things if they're not able to get that personal connection. And that can happen throughout the year. You know, it doesn't always have to be the principal who's doing that work. Like who are the other people that we can tap to be leaders within the building to help support those people. And you'll see a lot of it, especially within those supportive learning communities that we've been talking about tonight, the SLCs, you know, that there are very talented people within those structures who are also helping to do onboarding and training and development and support with people like our SSPs, those paraprofessionals within those programs. So it's still a challenge area. It will continue to be a challenge area, but I think that, you know, we've made a lot of great strides this year in trying to meet some of those needs. That's great. And I have one other question, my last question. So in what I do, we know if we can get them, if we can get our adjuncts through 12 weeks, the chances of them being successful, like there's just like this, there's this magic that happens. Like if we can get them there, then they're much more likely to be successful.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kate Perez - 416</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess there's probably two answers to that question. And one, I will, I want to recognize just how satisfying it has been for me to have this opportunity to be able to spend so much time like, you know, in those trenches with people and doing things like shadowing a para through their schedule and observing them in their work. And then being able to have time to kind of pull back and have a conversation about how did that went? What are you thinking about? And do some training also with their supervisors about how are we gonna manage this? But I think that there's a piece where it's almost like an immediate thing. Like that first impression means a lot to this group of people. So if we can get them immediately welcomed and feeling that sense of just human belonging initially, like and connecting them with the people who are their team, then that's the first big step, right? And I think we've done a good job with that. And so that for the most part, people will stay past, you know, a few weeks, right? But then after that, it probably is really more of a, like we need a good more like 60 days to kind of dig into that, get into the routines, really start to understand what it is that we're expecting of you. And I think, you know, we really do hope that at the end of this year, we'll have a good amount of the people who started this year, especially within that paraprofessional group who will want to stay next year. And I think the work within the contract and the talk of compensation and all of that will help support that. We'll be in so much better shape next year if we can really hold on to that pool of people and not have to start what feels like again every year. There are also people who have been in the district for a good long time. And I don't want to discount that is that we have paraprofessionals who really have been an important part of our programming for years and years and years. And I think that's kind of something that we need to tap into too is how do we help these people to also, like we talk about teacher leadership, be able to be leaders within their own, you know, group, professional group. So we'll see how that goes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we began our district-wide training for our cohort two teachers who will be teaching EL in grades K to five beginning in fall 2024. Our special educators, kindergarten paraprofessionals, principals, assistant principals, and multilingual learner teachers also participated in yesterday's professional learning session. Educators will be participating in a total of six of these sessions, which are organized and led by the curriculum developer and our PD provider, EL Education. We are very excited to launch this partnership with EL Education and to have our educators begin professional development now. Yesterday's session focused on providing an introduction to the curriculum, specifically the systems, and structures of the curriculum and the high leverage instructional practices, which you've heard of, including this evening by the Stratton team. Our kindergarten online registration opened earlier this afternoon. People can visit the district's website to learn more and to register. And thank you to our director of communications and family engagement, Wesley Etienne-Pierre and her team for their work to launch the online registration. Dr. Homan shared the most recent enrollment report and she also shared a projection sheet for your consideration and feedback, which also included recommendations. So please feel free to call or email Dr. Homan directly with any specific feedback or questions that you might have. And that's for the school committee members. And then finally, a huge congratulations to Arlington High School Honors Orchestra and their director, Tino D'Agostino. They were chosen to perform at the Massachusetts Music Educators Association Conference. The performance is scheduled for Thursday, March 21st in Worcester. We're proud of the AHS Honors Orchestra musicians for their high achievement and Mr. D'Agostino and performance arts director, Jingwei Wei, for their leadership.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it looks like a much longer list than it is in actuality. Within your packets, there's a long list of policies. Some are more trivial than others. And a draft copy of the minutes from our January 24th meeting, which offers more or less an explanation of what we're looking at. For first read right now, there are a couple of things that were of a little more substance. For example, file JLCD, administering medicines for students. That was a request of Dr. Allison Ampey to bring us into compliance with state regulations. BEDH, we're revising our public comment to conform to current state law. DI, fiscal accounting and reporting, was requested by the budget subcommittee. We will be, if this policy's approved, changing from monthly financial reports, which are administratively burdensome, to a more realistic schedule of reports in October, December, February, April, and June. So basically in every other month's cycle. There were some policies that were recommended by MASC to update, for example, for school meal policies. Now that we're doing universal free school meals, we need to change EFC and EFD to recognize the fact that we're not charging kids for meals and set our policy to conform with the regulations for the universal free meal program. Plus there are some technology adjustments that MASC recommended, which are files EHAA, EHB, GBEE, IJND, IJNDB, IJNDC, KDC, and KDCB. Many of them are fairly minor. We're also doing some gender neutrality. Ms. Gittleson has called attention to the policies where we have gender-specific language, and we'll be going through them on a regular basis to replace them with gender-neutral language. And the first five in that group right now are ACH, ACR, ACH-R, ADDA, and ADDA-R. So there's a little more detail about what's going on in the minutes. So that's what's before you for first read, comments, questions, or things that you might wanna think about changing. We can do that between now and with a motion to amend at the next meeting. Also note that ACA, non-discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, we requested that the superintendent and town council take another look at it. I'm told that there is a new version that will be brought back to us at the next subcommittee meeting, so more work. to do. Any questions or comments?</blockquote>

Okay so there's a few some of the ones where you're doing updates it has at the end it has a tagline which says the this information is is current as of like May 2014 so we should we should we that that will be updated after we have approved it so okay an approval line approved at the meeting of February whatever okay but the bigger ones are so first with BEDH I appreciate that you've tried to address my concerns but I am still concerned that it does not actually achieve the necessary specificity so that we are not providing a open forum and simultaneously putting restrictions on what people can say specifically I think they're ruling the Spalding ruling said that we can't provide an open forum and tell people that they can't talk about personnel and the only way in my understanding that we can do it is by circumscribing what can be talked about as stuff that is under our specific domain and the MASC example policy does that but so I'd either ask can you go back and look at that or talk to town council I think I think it's important we get the policy change so if we have an amendment that we can all agree to at the next meeting we can do it that way</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay so that's one thing and then the other I think JLCD the medication one yeah so that one I had brought up because I was concerned that we weren't in in find the name we weren't consistent with at the meeting the superintendent reported that while our language was vague it's certainly in referencing the state policy conforms to what we need to have okay I'm have we had town council check that I don't think so okay I would ask that we have town council just I think the regulatory part is a little ambiguous to me because it talks about policies and procedures and it talks about policies and it's not clear to me if we have procedures in place that aren't public but everyone knows about if that's enough or if it all has to be in policy so I just like someone to make sure that again we're doing this correctly yeah that was what the superintendent said is is that it was of her opinion I don't know if she talked to council about that but yeah she was pretty firm about saying that what we had at this point by referencing policy procedures and regulations that were acknowledging them and we're following them</blockquote>

Cardin can give an update on that when we get to budget second any abstention I mean any I know I have to do a roll call but first anyone have any discussion or comments I assume this is in order to better have meet a deadline for getting a budget book before town meeting and yes dotting our I's and crossing our T's with the yes yes it sounds reasonable to me okay all in favor this is a roll call vote miss Gittleson yes miss Exton mr. Cardin yes miss Morgan yes mr. Philman yes mr. Flickman yes and I also vote yes so that's unanimous so our school committee meeting of the 28th will now be held on the 21st

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi yes so as all of you know mr.
