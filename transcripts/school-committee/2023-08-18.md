> The School Committee meeting discussed the introduction of a new role, an inclusion specialist, to support larger class sizes at Thompson, particularly in grades one and two. The inclusion specialist would be a dual licensed professional who would work directly with teachers and provide additional support in the classroom. The role would involve attending grade meetings, planning with teachers, and potentially taking small groups from multiple classrooms for additional reading groups or other needs. The role is not intended to be a substitute teacher, but rather a support for teachers on instructional matters. The committee approved the role and plans to post the job swiftly. The meeting also discussed the logistics of conducting small group pull-outs, with the multi-purpose room and library suggested as potential spaces. The meeting concluded with a motion to adjourn.

> The Inclusion Specialist is a dual-licensed professional who will focus on lower grades with larger class sizes at Thompson. The role is designed to provide additional support in the classroom, working directly with teachers and students where and when it is needed. The specialist might take small groups from multiple classrooms for additional reading groups, provide support for a whole day in a classroom with particular student needs, or work with the SST team to address learning challenges. The position is needed due to larger class sizes, particularly in grades one and two, and the desire to have licensed professionals providing support rather than just adding teaching assistants. The specialist will also help to ensure a seamless transition if a teacher is absent.
</details><details><summary>What questions were asked and who asked them?</summary>

> The first question was asked by an unidentified speaker, who asked Dr. Homan about the class sizes for grades one and two at Thompson. The second question was also asked by an unidentified speaker, who asked Dr. Homan to describe a typical day for the inclusion specialist teacher and how they would interact with students, particularly in grade two where class sizes are larger.
</details><details><summary>What were Dr. Homan's answers to the questions about classroom size and a typical day for the inclusion specialist.</summary>

> Dr. Homan stated that the average class size in kindergarten is 20, in grade one it's 22.5, and in grade two it's 24.5. As for the inclusion specialist, they would attend all grade two meetings and plan with the teachers. They could take small groups from multiple classrooms for additional reading groups, provide support in a classroom for a whole day if there are specific student needs, or work closely with the SST team. The specialist could also be involved in the implementation of plans that come out of SST. The goal is to keep students in the classroom more, so small groups in the classroom would be more common than pull out groups. However, if pull out groups were needed, they could potentially use the multi-purpose room, library, or other small spaces.
