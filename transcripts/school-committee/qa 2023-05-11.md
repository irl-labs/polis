> The recommended elementary literacy curriculum is EL Education.

The curriculum is divided into modules, each focusing on different skills and topics. The curriculum also allows for creativity and flexibility in teaching, with opportunities for teachers to adapt lessons to their students' needs and interests. The implementation of the program will involve professional learning for teachers, adjustments to the daily instructional schedule, and ongoing support.
