Liz Holman responded by explaining that schools with significant impact on chronic absenteeism have been relentless in tracking trends and following up with families to inquire about the reasons behind absences. She mentioned strategies such as home visits and working with families to address challenges in getting to school. She also noted that chronic absenteeism had increased during the pandemic but was now slowly declining. Liz also mentioned partnering with the Director of Communications and Family Engagement to better handle ongoing chronic cases and identify them sooner.
