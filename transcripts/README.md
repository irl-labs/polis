### Transcripts and RAG

This directory contains transcripts of public meetings generated by OpenAI's whisper.  The directory is organized by the local authority with subdirectories for the Select Board, School Committee, Redevelopment Board, Zoning Board and Finance Committee.  

Each unchanged transcript is annotated by speaker; only partially automated at this time.

Annotations also condensed in many cases for readability (i.e. back and forth discussion or introductions/thanks).  The transcripts themselves are unedited and whisper brutalizes names; speaking more clearly in the future should minimize this.

In addition to the annotated transcripts (yyyy-mm-dd.md), there are other documents in each directory prefixed by "qa".  These are the unedited responses using Langchain's retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for a Q&A; "20 questions".  A representative [python notebook](https://github.com/irl-labs/polis/blob/main/notebooks/governance/transcripts%20ETL.ipynb) indicates the pipeline and prompt used.  The questions are generally summaries, details, lists and tables of agenda items.

Links to the original video and agenda items on the Novus platform contains background material for each agenda item.
