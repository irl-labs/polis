<details><summary>Please, summarize the Redevelopment Board meeting.</summary>

> The Redevelopment Board meeting was called to order by Rachel Zender, the Chair of the Redevelopment Board. Other members present were Steve Revellach, Eugene Benson, Shana Corman-Houston, Ken Low, and Claire Rickard, the Director of the Department of Planning and Community Development. Each member introduced themselves and their roles. The board discussed the meeting minutes from November 6, 2023, and made corrections. They also discussed the meeting schedule for their 2023 board retreat. The board also discussed potential topics for the retreat, including the Arlington Heights business district, the reduced height buffer area, illuminated signs, and the TDM with residential provisions. The board also discussed the potential for a new zoning by-law that regulates parking lots and requires trees in parking lots. The meeting concluded with the board discussing updates and new business.

> The changes made to the meeting minutes from prior meetings were suggested by Ken Lau. On the third page, fourth paragraph up from the bottom, the last sentence was changed to reflect that Ken Lau did not feel the applicant was required to meet the new requirements of the new zoning 45 policy. In the second to last paragraph, Ken Lau clarified that he meant it would probably take a year to do the architectural work and engineering work, so giving a two-year extension felt fine to him.

</details><details><summary>Detail Claire Ricker's update on the St. Camilla's church property that is up for sale.</summary>

> Claire Ricker provided an update on the St. Camilla's property, which is currently owned by the Archdiocese of Boston and is out for request for proposal (RFP). The property is approximately six acres and is located behind the Poets Corner Park. The Archdiocese has expressed a preference for housing on the property, which is currently zoned R1, R0. Under the existing zoning, six or seven single-family homes or a 40B project could be developed. The general consensus is that it will likely be a 40B project. Claire has fielded many calls from developers seeking information about the property and has shared all available public information. She has also had conversations about potential uses for the site, including retail space, community space, and stewardship over the park. The RFP is due to close soon, with an award expected by early spring.
