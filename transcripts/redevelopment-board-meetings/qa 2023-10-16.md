> The Redevelopment Board Meeting on October 16th was chaired by Ken Lau in the absence of Rachel. Other board members present were Steve Revellat, Eugene Benson, Claire Richter from the planning board, and Marissa Lau. The first agenda item was a public hearing on a zoning bylaw amendment, the MBTA Communities Act. Winnell Evans, a resident, spoke about her initial misunderstanding in submitting an article instead of an amendment, and her plans to submit an amendment to further pursue the boundary of the neighborhood multifamily districts. The board decided to recommend no action on this article. The second agenda item was postponed to November 6th due to only three board members being present. During the open forum, a resident raised concerns about the conditions of the hotel project and the presence of junk cars on the site. The board suggested contacting the building department about the junk cars. The meeting concluded with a reminder about the upcoming town meeting.
