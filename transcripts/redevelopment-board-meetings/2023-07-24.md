### Arlington Redevelopment Board - July 24, 2023  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFwx7J1gojE)  [agenda](https://arlington.novusagenda.com/agendapublic/MeetingView.aspx?MeetingID=1894&MinutesMeetingID=-1&doctype=Agenda)

<details><summary>Meeting Minutes</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 86</summary>

> So without further ado, let's go ahead and jump into our first agenda item, which is a review of the meeting minutes. I believe that we have three sets of meeting minutes and we'll take them in order, starting with the February 27th, 2023 meeting minutes. And I will ask if there are any additions or corrections. I know that some of them were received ahead of time and are reflected in the meeting minutes themselves. We'll start with Steve for any additional changes or corrections.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Rappalach - 110</summary>

> Madam Chair, I have three suggested changes. They're very small. Page two, third paragraph from the bottom, the sentence, Mr. Revelak, like the removal of the tandem parking space, I would propose changing space to spaces that it's plural. The remaining two are on the last page. In the second to last paragraph, Mr. Revelak, remind the board of the new section 5.42.B8, that should be 5.4.2.B. Just a missing period. OK. And in the last paragraph, the chair asked for a motion to adjourn to town meeting. I propose striking to town meeting. I don't believe it was in session in February. You are correct. Nothing further, Madam Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 244</summary>

> All right. Thank you. Gene, any additional corrections or additions? Ken? No. I do not have any either. So we will take a vote to approve the meeting minutes from February 27th, 2023 as amended, starting with Ken. Motion or to vote? A motion. Yes. So motion. Yes. Second. All right. We'll take a vote starting with Steve. Yes. Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. And yes as well. The meeting minutes from February 27th have been approved. We'll now move to the April 3rd, 2023 meeting minutes. And Steve, we'll start again with you for any additions or corrections. No changes, Madam Chair. Gene. No changes. Ken. No. No changes. And I don't have any either. Is there a motion to approve the April 3rd, 2023 meeting minutes as submitted? So motioned. Is there a second? Second. Let's take a vote to approve, starting with Steve. Yes. Ken. Yes. Gene. Yes. And yes as well. The April 3rd meeting minutes have been approved. We'll now move to the June 26th, 2023 meeting minutes. And we'll see if there are any additions or corrections, starting with Steve. No changes. Gene. No changes. Ken. No. None for me either. Is there a motion to approve as submitted? So motioned. Second. Okay. We'll take a roll call vote, starting with Steve. Yes. Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. And yes as well. The June 26th, 2023 meeting minutes have been approved. Thank you all. That concludes agenda item number one.

<details><summary>MBTA Communities</summary> 
<details><summary>	  Rachel Fenberry - 85</summary>

> And we will now move right into agenda item number two, which is the MBTA communities discussion. I will note that we will see where we are in about an hour from this working session. As per our agenda, if it looks like we need to extend it by half an hour, and there is time that people have available, we'll do so. But let's take a time check around 840 and see where we are. So with that, I'll hand it over to Claire.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 9</summary>

> Fantastic. Miss Sperry, is it okay to record this?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 23</summary>

> It's being recorded by ACMI, but there's certainly nothing stopping you from recording it on your own if you'd like to. You're welcome.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 707</summary>

> Great, thank you. So I think we're going to start tonight. Ken Lau and I have been working to put together a 3D model for some representation of how this zoning might look from street level or potentially other views. And so Ken, I don't know if you want to present this model?  Yeah. That'd be great. This model here is an existing model of Mass Ave and Broadway, a rough scale of all the existing buildings there that are, yeah. So it runs from Arlington, I'm sorry, from Somerville all the way to Lexington along Mass Ave and Broadway. We had this done a little while ago, and this is a rough start of what the existing buildings are based on Google. Okay, so we are thinking of using this as something that's a model of a representation of what's happening on Mass Ave and Broadway as we approve buildings or as we use this as a study to see what kind of massing we can do. We'll be adding things to it. Like right now, we're in the process of getting the high school that will be done this end of year. We're going to have that place. And this right now, the old high school, you want to go down a little where this is the high school? That's right there. That's the old high school. Okay, so we haven't got the new high school in there yet, but we're in the process of putting that new high school in there, and as buildings get approved and put in along Mass Ave, they'll be also put in there so people have an idea of how this thing's growing and how you see things next to each other. So we're trying to be cognizant of representation, what's there. Okay, so we took this and said, okay, let's apply the MBTA communities on top of this. So G is one-on-one ahead and put massing along here. Okay, can you turn that layer on, please, G? Yeah, this is a landslide. So if I... So this one is... And this is an early, early start. Okay, so it's going to just be patient with us since we're getting more and more to this. So for instance, this guy's here. If I hide this, this is existing. Yep. So if I want to hide this, this is new based on... This is not where we're going to represent the next day. This, it would, it could be potentially in 50 to 100 years from now. Zoning does not happen overnight, right? So these things that could happen along the way as it goes along, if it's built up to the maximum, they may not build up things to the maximum because it doesn't make sense. So this is just a representation to see what things may look like on areas that we planned to have some sort of growth there, okay?  So this is just a way of us discussing and talking about what we have here. So whatever's here, please don't take it as that's it. This is what we're presenting. This is the first time many of the board members have seen this. So it's a process that we're using, but we're just presenting it right now so we can see it. And I'm going to leave it now, see if any of the board members have any questions on what we try to do here. And she's represented as a street view, now it's an aerial view. So it's a way we can play with different things. And, you know, we can take out some of the buildings, increase some of the buildings, put setbacks in, or bring it all the way up to the street. Now you have this representation of what's there, as opposed to thinking about it or saying it, having someone's opinion on it. So it's actually there. So that's where we're working from right now, okay? No more, it's going to be a wall. Well, if it is, it'll show here. I mean, it doesn't show every window, it doesn't show every corner, but you see the massive. And that's what we're trying to do here right now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 92</summary>

> Can I ask a question? One of the things that may be helpful for people, again, because we've talked about how this is something that will evolve over time, we're building the capacity and that this takes time as properties change hands, et cetera. You know, perhaps we could make some educated projections around, you know, this is at 10% build out in, you know, X number of years. This is what it looks like when it's 20% built out. And then pick a few pockets so that, again, I think it's,
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 91</summary>

> you make a really good point that this is not, we're not flipping a switch and all of these properties change over. And, you know, in 2025, everything is built out to the capacity. So I think it might be helpful when this is shown during, you know, if we use this as a tool during some of the hearings, et cetera, to think about having a few steps along the way shown. I'm curious what other people might think. All right, so I was waiting for you to go first.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 80</summary>

> No, I think this is a really wonderful way to help visualize it. And it does make it, it is a much more concrete way of presenting things than just, you know, saying it, we're going to allow the heights of this and setbacks of that. No, I want to say thank you for the time you put into this. This is useful. Does it show us any actual recognizable buildings or just sort of the scale of this building?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 408</summary>

> Yeah, there, when you see some of the towers along Mass Ave, those towers exist in Mass Ave right now. But if they went into the street, if you went into the street. Yeah, there's the firehouse through the tower there. Can we go in a street view of the firehouse?  Yes, can you put us down right here and do a street view there? So if you put the camera. It's just to the right, it's back a little more. We have another model also, I suppose she's doing this, of a topo. And we have another model of some street trees and power poles. It gives you a better reference. But for now, if you build that on, we're looking at a supercomputer right now. So this is a high station. We have a position here in the street. So we would have this is a primary part. That's all the retail. That's the firehouse. We're too close right now to the firehouse. Yeah, it's basically massing. Yeah, it's massing, so it's not. So this is along the Mass Avenue. So if I walk here. So this is a new building, which is allowed for six stories. And this is all existing. We're not going to change anything. And this building is already 75 feet, more than six stories. So if I keep moving here, we walk along the Mass Avenue. So that's the firehouse right there. That's a church. Sorry, that's a Calvary church. Sorry. It's not much change on the Mass Avenue. Almost a few buildings allowed for six stories. See this building here?  That's existing. Yeah. So this is not so smooth, but it gets some ideas. So this is the wrong one. It's existing. And then this one is a new one, which is allowed for six stories. That's with the bonus. We won't go into that quite yet. I don't want to get into the details of zoning and all the other stuff that we're talking about quite yet. I just want to show you the model and what we're trying to do here. And then we'll later on talk about what we're looking at as far as allowable by real estate. As far as allowable by right. Some of the bonuses we're trying to add in. I don't know if we can talk about it and debate that, but let's not use the model for that right now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Relivek - 25</summary>

> Yes, Steve? I was just wondering, what are the red? So I understand the blue is what's currently under proposal. And what is the red?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 186</summary>

> Oh, the red is the same like this. When we first did this, some of them, the red was some government buildings or... Oh, okay. This model has been used for many things as we went along. And I'm just morphing it from right now for this. And we can change the colors. I mean, just give us a little more time. This is just starting. Oh, no, no, no. I understand. I just wanted to... So in other words, don't pay too much attention to the red, just the blue. No. Yeah. Okay. And right now, all the ground is flat right now. Okay. We do have a model that's sort of shifted. So you see the topo of the ground of the street going up or down. And where there's... Let's say, especially in heights, like behind it, the buildings are much, much higher, and it hits some steepness. We try to capture that, but it just takes so much to compute for us to put this thing right up. It's not quite there yet, okay? We do recognize that, okay? So, yes, Sanjay?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sanjay Newton - 126</summary>

> Um, is that... But you're able to do maybe, like, small renderings of smaller pieces, including that extra detail? I don't know. Of topo. So, like, you're saying you have the information to do topo or... The topo's already in the model. It's a different version of the model. Okay. Okay. But in order to go through the model and put some of this massing in, you got to... You took that, I don't know what you call it, layer or whatever off, and it resides somewhere else. So you can still work within that. And my question is, for town meeting or preparation for using this, we could then produce imagery that includes both what you're showing here, plus the topo layer added back in.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 148</summary>

> Actually, when topo is almost flat, it doesn't make sense that you're making tiny, because we want to represent this pretty much very close to the reality. No, no, what you want to talk about topo, it deals with the surrounding neighborhoods, and Mass Ave is not flat. Mass Ave is some parts of hills, and sometimes it goes up, and it goes around bends. If you look at the other model, it shows a great deal that way. Yeah, okay. Okay, but we... We're not that far into it right now, and I'm not even sure we can get that done. For a town meeting, okay? Imean, I know of this because they have this in Boston right now, but they have a crew of like eight people, and a dedicated department and a budget to do that. And all the developers use that as a resource.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sanjay Newton - 112</summary>

> One other related question. You mentioned, so I see a couple of trees there. You know, what are the possibilities in terms of including either trees that exist, and or, you know, if we were to change the bylaw to require a street tree every 25 feet in all residential, like, okay, what does that become in 10 years or 20 years? In the block, some of that was... I don't think it was completely done. This was a process that was... COVID. I really put a stop to this, okay? And then we have a shift of personnel in Claire's department. And so... It sounds like it's inconsistent, so it probably...
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 278</summary>

> It's possible, but it's not there. But it was always thought of having street trees along there, because it really made a difference on how you salt, and it softens the edge. And then when you're down on the street level, you see trees, and then you see it. It makes a big difference. I can answer your one question for the trees. If you put a 3D tree, this model is going to be huge. It's not going to move. We can put a 2D to get some basic idea of what this looks like, which is doable. I'm wondering if we could have maybe, you know, in time for the fall, just it wouldn't even... We wouldn't have to fly through the model or anything. Just some stilts that show the build out. Yeah, 2D trees, things like that. Yeah. That's something that she, in my previous life as an architect, she used to do that really well by taking a sketch up frame like this, and then hand-drawing right over it of a rendering of the buildings and trees and street, and put all the entourage in. And then you'll see an image of what that may look like. But I'm not sure we have the time or funding for it right now. All right. So these are all great ideas, and we're just going to have to see what we want and what we want to pay for right now. Got it. Okay. And you know how tough that was just to get here. Okay. Sorry, I want to make sure Gene has asked a question, and then we do need to move on.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Gene Benson - 115</summary>

> Yeah, so this is my concern about it. You know, the thing that makes the street interesting and nice and human scale are the windows, the storefronts, things like that. None of that is here. So when I look at myself walking down here, all I see is blank walls on both sides. And I sort of feel like if we take it to town meeting, and this is what it is, what a lot of town meeting members are going to take away from it is, oh, we're going to be building street after street of blank walls. Which is not our intention and won't happen. I think this could lead that false impression.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 161</summary>

> I agree with that. And I'm not sure we should be using it. Well, I think we use this for a masking, but then say, for example, this is up already, okay? You take this as a wire mold, and then you can draw in, by hand, all the windows and cornices and the setbacks and all that kind of stuff, and illustrate just one view. You have to do something like that. And that's where we present, say, this is what we have here, and this is based off a model that has all this other stuff in it. You know, I have to say this, or to take a picture of a block of Mass Ave, where we know what it's like, and put in what some of the buildings would be, if they were masked with windows and storefronts. That can also be done, too. I think that will be a much better representation than what this is.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 18</summary>

> Okay. This is a great start. Any other questions, Steve, Jean, Claire? All right. Thank you very much.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire? - 96</summary>

> Thank you. I just want to mention one thing here. On this model, so you can see, we do a little bit of setback on the top, so it's just making this more interesting. That's also related with, if you do the zoning, you can always say, maybe after four stories, you have to set back 10 feet, so five feet to the sun. So, that's all can be done, the more things that we can do further. This is a very short time, so we're giving you a big idea here. Yeah. Great. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire? - 389</summary>

> Thank you very much. Just let me turn it off. So, I'm just going to grab the HMI function. I just want to remind you. All right. So, we have, as I'm sure, folks, I've seen a lot of you at our working group meetings before, we have an updated map. We showed a map on the 18th, and we did a little tiny bit of refinement, and Util was able to turn this map around to us again, really quickly. There's not much new here. I think you can see, as compared to the map from the 18th, this map from the 19th has cleaner edges to the south and north, especially on the Broadway corridor. Yep, and then also cleaner edges sort of along Mass Ave in the center and closer to the height. So, this map is slightly different than the one we used in the working group last week, but it is still very representative of what we've been working on and what we've been talking about. So, what is modeled here are some of the votes and agreements we came to last week, at least in terms of the working group's recommendation, which is for the Mass Ave and Broadway dimensions, there's zero minimum parking requirements, a maximum of four stories that is not, we have not designated feet, like a linear height, 10 foot front setback, five foot sides, 20 foot rear. And then you can see for the neighborhood, again, no minimum parking, max four stories, 10 front, 10 sides, 20 rear. We also discussed a bonus on Mass Ave and Broadway for those, or for a developer who's willing to put in a first floor commercial. They could go up another story, for a developer who's willing to put in a first floor commercial, and affordable units, they could potentially go up to six stories. We didn't get a chance to really dig into the neighborhood multifamily and discuss a bonus or an affordability, a bonus for those areas yet, we ran out of time, but these were at least the votes taken and the recommendations made, including on setbacks. So I don't know if the board would like to discuss this with the working group. I'm not sure how the board feels about the recommended setbacks or the recommended bonuses.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 704</summary>

> Thank you so much, Claire. I appreciate the way that this is shared. It's great to see some of the policy recommendations starting to be overlaid on this map. And I appreciate the work that's gone into looking to clean up some of the edges and make some of the parcels more contiguous. I think that that's very helpful. Just a couple of questions I have as to whether or not some of these items were considered. One of the things that I think would be interesting, again, along Mass Ave and Broadway, we're very interested in trying to get to a condition where mixed use is certainly preferred by the board. Whether a combination of a maximum of three stories with a bonus of one story for, if there's one story of commercial on the ground floor and a bonus of actually an additional two stories if there are two stories of commercial is something that had been looked at. That was our vote. One story commercial and two additional stories for residential. What I'm saying is giving one additional story, if you build one floor commercial, two additional stories, if you build two stories of commercial. So we recently had a project that we permitted on Broadway that came in not with just one story of commercial, but actually two, and then residential above, which was a wonderful project. For a total of eight. Nope, for a total of no more than six stories. So state with your six stories. Oh, I see. And so the bonus wouldn't just be, you get two additional stories if you have one floor of commercial, but step back so that you further incent multi-stories of commercial on the first and second floor. We didn't think about that. Additional story, okay. And we can go back and bring that in and just talk about and discuss. Sure. What we thought about to encourage commercial along there was we allowed projects that were on Mass Ave to have zero line setbacks if it's commercial in the first place. And then we started, but we did not finish talking about side yard setbacks, reducing that to zero. But right now we still have it at 15. We still haven't really talked about that yet, okay. But then- Give it a 10. Yeah, sorry. We had a 10, but we're thinking of maybe bringing that down to zero. And with that encouragement, we really wanted to encourage ground floor retail by giving it a bonus of two floors of additional height. So we really push the fact that if you do ground floor and you push it up, we're gonna give you two floors of something that can be built. But similar to what they're doing right now, I believe in Lexington. Right, and I'm suggesting to add another option to that. Yeah, we could talk about that, but I just think adding another floor to that we talked about briefly, but not really, is if someone was gonna develop, and if they have ground floor retail, and it's supposed to have a second floor commercial housing, they're gonna pick housing over commercial space right now, but in the future, they may. So that's something we had to talk about, and I think it's something we can look into. Again, I would try, whether it's you leave it at a maximum of three, and then you bonus two, and then one, or vice versa. I think you need to make it worth their while to take that option, but I think it's something that would be really interesting to take a look at. Also, the other thing, sorry. We also took an approach of parking, which is always a big issue, and we stated that we're not gonna have minimums. We're gonna say maximums, and let the areas, and let the project decide having more parking or make the project work, or less parking. So we went, some of the other towns that we ran out, and we constructed parking maximums. So those are the things that we did vote for, and have as encouragements, and we said we'll talk about the second floor commercial. I'll let you finish.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 68</summary>

> Yeah, I'd like to return to that. I'd like us to go before the group gets to that. Was it specific to the height bonuses? I have a number of things. Some of them I think are fine. Well, why don't we, if Sanjay has something specific to the heights that I mentioned, why don't you go ahead and share that, and then we'll move to James' comments.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sanjay Newton - 87</summary>

> The one thing I would sort of say that we did think about in terms of heights, and thinking about what the base by right thing was. One of the pieces of advice we got from Utila was make sure that you would be pleased if developers built the thing that you make by right. And so would we be happy if we got a bunch of three-story, only three-story residential development in the Longmass Ave? I think it's a thing to think about as you consider.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 69</summary>

> Sure. Yeah, I think that that's a fair question, and again, if we're giving up this space and saying that we are by right allowing residential only, we've already identified that as something, as giving up potentially an opportunity for commercial development. We're adding that opportunity back in to try and make it as attractive as possible is the way that I'm looking at it. One more on, yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sanjay Newton - 122</summary>

> Yeah, I just think that we took very much to heart your goal to make sure that there was plenty of commercial space, and what we started with was what was the maximum height we could allow, and then we backed out towards what incentives we could give. So I think we were under the impression that if we really wanted to incentivize commercial on the first floor, we would have to give two stories for residential. If your expertise is different than that, I think we're open to changing our recommendations that we were guided to believe that we would have to give that type of incentive, two for one essentially, to get any commercial on those first floors. Right, right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 23</summary>

> Yeah, and I'm in agreement with that. I think I'm stepping it differently is the only thing that I'm asking to be considered.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Laura Wiener - 100</summary>

> I just wanted to add, I'm Laura Wiener. Yes. I'm on the 3TA working group as well. I mean, the goal of the program is to ban housing, that that is what the region needs, more than more office space, and I think to give an incentive for more office space and at the cost of that additional residential is contrary to the goal of the program. What we also need to keep in mind with the town needs and the town needs both is the position that I'm coming from. So go ahead, Gene, you had some additional thoughts.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Gene Benson - 425</summary>

> Yeah, I'll start off by saying I agree with the town needs both. I like the idea of a bonus of two floors in order to have commercial on the ground floor, but some of the other things in here are disincentives in that direction, and I'd like to have you reconsider some of them. One is the parking minimums of zero, I think are a disincentive for people to do mixed use because mixed use requires parking and allows us to reduce but not eliminate the parking amounts. So I think that it's a mistake, and I would probably not vote for something that does away with parking minimums altogether. What I think you can do, which would be very successful, is say that for the residential, they're subject to the same requirements that we now have for the commercial, which is basically you can get a 75% reduction in the amount of parking if you have a transportation demand management plan. And I believe that we can do that under site plan review so that that's a way to not disincentivize people to go to mixed use and not result in no parking where we don't have off-street parking. So my suggestion is take a look at that and see if there's a way to flip it so that we can use site plan review and transportation demand management plans to get what we want without disincentivizing people from going to mixed use. So that's one. The second has to do, and I'm only sort of talking about the disincentives. I have some other issues I'll get to also. The setbacks, I have some problem with the front yard setbacks. And here's my suggestion for the setbacks. If you have a setback, I'm not sure what it should be. Some of my friends on the way in suggested 15 feet. If you have a 15 foot front yard setback for residential, but if you do mixed use with commercial on the ground floor, you don't have that setback anymore. That's yet another incentive for people to do mixed use rather than residential. And if you look at Mass Ave, most of the, not all, but most of the residential have some amount of setback. Very few of the commercial have any setback or mixed use setback. So I'd like to sort of think about that and flip the incentive to make the incentive to go with mixed use because you don't have a setback, but otherwise require the setback if it's pure residential.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire? - 50</summary>

> Gina, sorry, just a clarification on that point. Are you suggesting that in the neighborhood district and in Mass Ave, Mass Ave go to 10 or 15 resi and zero mixed use? Zero mixed use. Thank you. Yes. It doesn't say that now, right? That was our intention. Oh, okay.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Gene Benson - 126</summary>

> Well, I wanted it to finish. Okay. Well, if that was your intention, great. It just doesn't show up on what we talked. That's fine. That's terrific. The other thing we've talked about, the other thing we've talked about before is applying the tree planting requirements to, I'd say, not only Mass Ave Broadway, but also the neighborhood multifamily districts too, which we can do, which is shade tree every 35 linear feet, but it also requires within, in between them, irrigated planter boxes, which is now in the zoning bylaw, which I think is another thing that we could do in both Mass Ave Broadway and the neighborhood district. I'll say my other things for later, but that has to do with incentives and disincentives.
</details>

> To answer your question, we did talk about planting trees, which is not in here yet. We did talk about that. We had a lot of discussions about that. We had also discussions about allocating enough space for trees along Mass Ave. And we actually actually talked about removing some of the parking spaces along Mass Ave, along Dog Yard, that actually give enough space for a tree to grow and mature.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 50</summary>

> I'm a little bit against irrigating any vegetation along Mass Ave. That's against needs and against, we should get trees that- Native species. Yes, thank you. Yes, I agree, but the current bylaw says planter boxes also. I think they meant alligator bags, which is the bag for the wild.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 284</summary>

> Okay. But we did have a long session, but it didn't quite make it all here yet. Yeah, well, and the one thing I would say in terms of the street tree, including of the tree trees, I think the advice, and Claire can correct me if I'm wrong, the advice we got from the TO is that we probably would have compliance problems if we only did that for the MBTA communities just there. But we would have to, if we do that as a, extend what we do today for commercial and industrial to across all residential, that that would be a way to go. And I think, I don't think the working group formally voted on that, but I think that my understanding from the conversation is that the working group would definitely support doing that. So we can't do it as part of MBTA communities proper. So what we would need to do then as a redevelopment board is come up, that would be a separate zoning bylaw change. And I'll add that to my very rapidly growing list. Buckle up, y'all. It's gonna be, I think we're up to 12 now. Okay, so street trees requirements. 35 or 25? I'm pretty sure it's- No, the card zoning bylaw is 35. Is it? I thought, for some reason I had 25 in my head, but whatever the card is- Maybe your head is right, my head is wrong. It's 25. It's 25. 25, thank you for the clarification. That's what I thought. Okay. Okay, I stand corrected. That's what I thought. Okay, I stand corrected. So that's a new one. Okay. Do you need the hydrants? I got the hydrants.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 309</summary>

> Go ahead. So what I like about this other than- what we just talked about is that the zone would not be in any of the current business or industrial districts as I was mentioning. We're going to have higher heights on the S7 Broadway than on the side streets. More of Broadway's encompassed than on the previous maps. More of Broadway's encompassed than on the previous maps. And it excluded the part of Arlington Heights where we're going to do rezoning. So I think those are all terrific. I have a few suggestions that were unclear to me from looking at the materials. And I mentioned this to you Sanjay, the idea of allowing townhouses in the neighborhood multifamily district. And I think it's possible to allow three to six unit townhouses where the side setbacks and the back setbacks are the same as if they were a single unit. One single family home. So we would have a three to six unit townhouse structure, 20 feet in back, 10 feet on each side, as you're proposing, and 10 feet in front, and allow a maximum of three stories. We have, I think you have to do something like that in the MBTA communities. Because the current zoning for townhomes is so crazy in the amount of side setbacks and open space that it doesn't work. So I think something like that would have to be written specifically into this. And I wouldn't put it on S7 Broadway, but I would definitely put it in the neighborhood multifamily district. So I have a few questions about the map. If I can put that back up on my computer for a second. So there are many places where the district ends partway down the street. That was a difficult decision. Yeah, so talk about how that decision was made.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 70</summary>

> So the model from, do you want to talk about that? Sure, I can at least talk about this part. Util came in off the midline of Mass Ave, approximately 325 feet, to encompass any Mass Ave parcel, and then the two to three parcels behind. The idea is that the transect would be 60 feet, 40 feet, and then down to the vernacular that's in the neighborhood right now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 136</summary>

> So that is why, you know, if there's the sort of, what looks like three or four, you know, five parcels there, that is by design. And there are some places that, at least to my eyes, seemed a little bit of strange, like at the corner of Allen Street and Andrew Street. Allen goes up, but doesn't hit, it's like one parcel. It's two parcels more on Allen and Adams, but it doesn't get to the corner parcel. And that's one where right on the other side, right on the other side of Andrew Street, it's the MBTA district. It wasn't our intent that we should get that. Okay, can you tell us again? I'm sorry, we can't hear you through this. We got it, we got it, don't worry about it. Okay. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 218</summary>

> I'll take my time. All right. Yes. And this Belknap Street, I'll just use that as another example because he used to live there. The side of Belknap Street that's not in the zone is the one where we gave approval for a four unit building. And I'm just wondering whether it makes sense to just add this side of Belknap Street, so it's... We can consider that. It's just that when we first looked at it, I didn't want to change everything to this, okay? So I was mindful of keeping it to a certain square footage and then if things grow and things are getting better, we continue with this process. But if I were to... I would have suggested that because most of those buildings are already... So why put it in there if it's already that way? Well, because if anybody wants to do work or build one, then they have to go get a waiver or whatever. Okay. So it would be easier if it would just be... It's just that one block. Yep. That's like that. That's a good thing. I'm curious about... We go back to this page where they talk about scenario one and scenario two. Scenario two being 50 units of acre max. We only have one scenario now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 196</summary>

> Oh, you're not rid of scenario two? Okay. I would throw it. It's not necessary. What are you going to do about lot sizes? Are you having lot sizes? And if so, what are they going to be? We are not going to have minimum lot sizes. I think Steve has a... Yeah. In terms of... I mean, in terms of dimensional regulation, what we've been talking about is fairly similar to what Lexington did. You'd have height, then building setbacks, and you'd have parking. In terms of lot sizes, we are limited by what's there. And the size of the lot will dictate, to a fair degree, what's buildable on it. So no lot size, yes, front setback, yes, side setback, yes, rear setback, no FAR? No FAR. No. What about landscape open space and usable open space? In our current bylaw, because they're GFA-based, they've had the effect of inhibiting... Right. Yeah. So, yeah, we decided we left those out as well. Setbacks are the vehicle. All right. So setbacks are the vehicle. Yeah. And that's how the compliance model, like the data, handles that as well. That's correct. Yes. Thank you. That's it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 79</summary>

> Can I ask another question about what potentially was considered as well? I had an email from somebody with, I thought, a really interesting idea around the frontage road along Route 2 between Pleasant Street all the way up to Lexington right by St. Camilla's. Yes. Yes, which we have talked about, the potential of rezoning. And given that those parcels phase Route 2, is that something that the working group thought about including as part of this study?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Fenberry - 58</summary>

> Yes. Yes, we certainly talked about that. I don't think we made a formal vote or recommendation on it. I think one of the things that Claire has mentioned, which I think is actually pretty interesting, is if you took the map of Arlington and overlaid all of the places that we've talked about, you get almost Arlington.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 133</summary>

> Oh, I'm sure. There have been great ideas from all over. I'm really excited about many of the ideas that have come forward. And that's including ideas from working group members and staff and you guys and the public. We've heard lots of great ideas from lots of different places. To that specific idea, I think we ended up deciding to focus more on our high transit, our bus lines. The corridor. The corridor along Mass Avenue. The corridor along Mass Avenue. We decided to focus on that. We decided to focus there. I only thought of including that particular area is because of its easy access to a life and the bus line that runs down it very regularly. So, yeah, just just wondering if that had been discounted for a specific.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 153</summary>

> It hadn't been discounted, but it doesn't have the attraction also of commercial business proximity. That's fair. Obviously, we're talking about change for this community and change is hard. So, you know, focused on those changes that seem to have the most things we can check off. Sure. And being in proximity to commercial districts seem to be a high priority as well as having access to public transit. And I think I think or I would hope that part of what the working group does as part of our final report is talk about some of these great ideas that we've heard from various people. And, you know, suggest you all to continue those conversations. The master plan.  We're going to be going through the master plan. Some of those conversations, because there were lots of great ideas. And, you know, the unfortunate reality is we can't do them all. Yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 127</summary>

> Yeah. One of the things I liked about this to respond to that, and I got that email also. I like this because it's really consistent with the 15 minute neighborhood concept and sustainability. And that's, I think, one of the things that a lot of us have talked about. Maybe I misinterpreted the email a little bit. I almost thought the one about, you know, do something on the Route 2 corridor and do something on Park Street. I almost interpreted it as it's too busy for single family homes. So build multi-family homes there instead, which sort of seemed to me as not the way to look at it. You know, and at least that was part of the message I took away from that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 52</summary>

> I'm trying to see what your feelings are. So I'd like to bring that to the working group and talk about that. I didn't want to just bring that up yet until we had a chance to discuss it amongst ourselves. Did I make myself clear enough or no? To me? Yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 146</summary>

> Okay. That's an interesting question. I'm looking to see, so that I speak correctly, what we decided to do about that. We already talked about what to do around these corner lots. That's part of our work for the zoning articles. Yeah, we did talk about this when it turns a corner, but then when it turns a corner again, that's a side yard setback. This is no longer a rear yard setback. Now you've got a commercial space with a full zero lot setback and full height. And then you go to a front yard setback, which is 25 feet for a residential. I'm looking at that map and these parcels. So if you look at the blue buildings between Trowbridge Street and Marathon Street, that's an example of what you're talking about. There's two corner buildings right there. Can you just decide which supersedes?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 39</summary>

> We could decide that the blue building supersedes, and that would be its rear setback. Or you could decide that the brown building supersedes, and that would be a side setback. Have I got it right, what you're saying?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 133</summary>

> No, what I'm trying to say is can you wait for that discussion when we have our meeting? Oh, yeah. I'm trying to get what their feelings are so I can bring it to our meeting to discuss it. Right, but am I right in what you're describing as being the problem? No. Well, then never mind. So you're trying to get to a point where they're in a corner lot, there are no rear yard, they're both considered side setbacks. That's the way it is right now. I think I understand where Mr. Lowe is coming from. If you give it a corner lot, you have two front yards, and what we want to ensure is that the other two sides aren't smacked right up against something else. That's the general gist?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 152</summary>

> Yes. Because the fact that it's no longer resident or commercial along Mass Ave, we're turning it in now and extending up some side streets. So I just want to get a feeling for what the board feels and get their ideas so that I can bring it back to the working committee and talk about it and see what their dialogue is. And I just want to see what you guys think. And if I could just continue my line of questioning, this is really something that would, in the blue districts, apply if someone elected to do mixed use. If it was straight residential, it probably wouldn't be a big deal. But with mixed use and having the zero foot setbacks. So what we really want, I think what you're saying we should really think about is the transition from a mixed use building to an abiding residential building. Yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 208</summary>

> Okay. If I didn't confuse myself on you guys enough. I get it. So let me see if I understand. So we have a building on the corner of Mass Ave and the street that intersects with Mass Ave. They're both fronts. The one on Mass Ave, let's say, has someone on the setback. The one on the side street, the residential street, one's supposed to be on the left. What's the setback? Is that a question? I'm- Can you draw us a picture? Yes. Right, so this is your corner. Yes. You're saying it's mixed use, you have a zero setback, zero setback, but you still have the side yard setback. That's considered a side yard setback. And this would be considered a side yard setback. Correct. Correct. And then this is the side yard. And then this has a 25 yard. And then this is the yard. Now, this thing here is really encroaching a lot into that building there. I'm just asking what your feelings are because we're taking this and turning it. You see all those blues and all the other stuff. And it's just the next step of evolution of talking about this. And I just want to see what your opinions are.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 146</summary>

> I mean, I think if you allow me to make my suggestion. Please. I would say these both are front yard setbacks. We're going to claim this as the primary front yard setback. Which is consistent with what we were doing elsewhere. And then on the secondary front yard setback, we still allow zero on that side there. Yep. But as it comes, approaches to the side yard setback, no, we taper it. And I would say maybe limit to maybe three stories or something along those lines. And so it's not because right now, if this thing is true, we can go up six stories with water. Or maybe the force that we set back on it. But we have an edge there. So if we just step it down, that would be my suggestion. But I just want to see what your suggestion is.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 60</summary>

> Well, that's actually the opposite of what we're suggesting in the zoning bylaw change. Which is to pick a primary facade. And that's the facade that has a setback. And the setback is not required on the secondary front yard setback. Step it back. On secondary front yard setback. You're suggesting not a setback, but a step back. Correct. Correct?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 726</summary>

> Yes. Because if you set... Opposite of... Yes, because if you set it back, that means you're eliminating square footage on a ground floor for commercial. Correct. And I don't want that. Oh, I understand. But if we acknowledge the fact that there's housing there, and you can't go up that high. So it's not like a big massing next to another. That's what I initially thought of. And I just want to see what you guys think. I personally don't see an issue with it. Because I think that that's what any building on that side of... Currently, that's the condition that is created when you have a commercial building and a residential block right next to it. There's no real step back requirement. But I can go up six stories right in that corner. You can go... You can in any mixed use... Yes but I was thinking that if we have that maybe we soften it a little bit and say you can't go up two stories on a secondary front yard and maybe bring it down a floor or two so it tapers down as it gets back to the residential. That's all. Okay. How would it taper? By lowering the amount of floors there. The entire size? I'm just thinking out loud. I was hoping we'd have a dialogue. I wasn't trying to give you an answer whether you say yes or no. It's a good question. I want to play with it with a pencil first. I'm personally, I don't think it's necessary given again the condition that we see in other properties that are of that height when they abut a residential property. You sort of ran into that a little bit with that hotel project. Again so we have site plan review. If there's a, we're looking at incorporating site plan review and if there's an extenuating circumstance I'm sure that that's something that can be reviewed but it's counter to how we are looking at massing in other areas of Mass Avenue and I don't see the necessity. I mean it's an interesting discussion because it brings up the discussion we had last year about do we continue to require step backs on whatever... The secondary facade, right. And is it on Mass Ave or is it on the side street that we do it? Let's talk about it. So we had a line that was step back on Mass Ave to vary the streetscape. Yeah and I feel like part of this, I almost feel like in this discussion part of it is do we want to take the step back and move it from the primary facade to the part of the building that's opposite the primary facade. Great, great. It doesn't, yeah, architecturally that doesn't, there's not a lot of precedent for that. Yes, I agree. Let's, I figured we should talk about that and give the board some guidance. So if there's a 20 foot setback, is there a 20 foot setback between the 6 story building and the 3 story building that was beyond it? No. Well effectively yes because there's a 10 foot, 10 foot, so there's 20 feet between them. Oh yeah, okay, I'm just, I'm talking really from the supply line, it's a... So it's 20, 20 feet. Between them, yes. Between them. Is that enough for 6 stories or, so 3 stories higher than the building next to it or should they step back and move that way to 5 stories? I think we should. I just, architecturally it does not make any sense to me, personally. So I would not be in favor of that. I don't know. Let's, I forgot what to talk about, okay. I'm going to ask G to get a little block model of that and I'll send it around. I don't know the answer. Well, I, there's possibly another approach is that, you know, this would involve changing, well, the basic gist is saying, in the scenario where we have two side yards and two front yards, maybe we say that if you have two front yards, you must have at least one back yard, but you have the option of where you put it. That's changing the zoning altogether. Okay. Well, no, there's, this isn't... This is its own zoning. Right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 285</summary>

> So... Section 538 doesn't apply and this other part applies instead. Okay. That's what we talked about. I've never, I've always, whenever I've looked at zoning, it's always, if it's on the corner, it's two front yards and two side yards. That makes up the four sides. Okay. And that's what you have in a quarter unit, a quarter lot. The reason I bring it up is there's so many of those corners and I want to just talk about that once or so before we get too far down. It is a very good point. And if we don't, if you don't have a conclusion, that's fine. We can talk about it. When I'll bring it back to the deck, we can talk about it. It sounds like we've come up with three options at least. One is do nothing. Right. The second option is step down. The third option is require a larger setback on that side. Right. Those are the three. Those are the three options. Yeah. Okay. So it's maybe you go to ground level. Second level commercial is a no setback. Then start third floor, which is residential. You said that. So either way. So I think this is what you're saying. You wind up with these buildings with a fight out of them. No, no, no. I think you're misinterpreting that a little bit. Let me do a little take away. Okay. That's fine. I find that me, you really seldom disagree on anything so far. So I'm just finding that this is kind of awkward. Let me draw up a little block. Okay. I'm having a look at it. And I can sketch them out. Okay. All right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Steve Relivek - 655</summary>

> Next topic. Steve, if I could, I'd like to just call out one thing that we as a group talked about last week, but made the decision not to do. At our last joint working session, we talked about basically eliminating some parcels around smaller business districts to facilitate expansion in the future and parcel consolidation. Yes. We, which this map does not do. So it just leaves out the B district parcels. It doesn't do that stuff around them. The work group felt that this was a task that was better suited to the redevelopment board. So that's being kicked back to us. Yep. So let's talk about how we will address that. So I talked with Sanjay and Claire last week, last week, last Wednesday. And one of the things that we kicked around was having Gene and myself, because we're not in the working group, do a bit of a walking tour along Mass Ave to look at some of these isolated parcels that are still included in the blue parcels that are part of the Mass Ave Broadway sub-district where there might be one or two isolated. I know that Kristen Anderson and some other folks have shared this might be zoned residential, but it's actually a business. I want to go and take a look at some of those with the most current version of the map. And I think Gene and I were talking about finding a time to do that this weekend so that we could get feedback sooner rather than later. And I apologize. I would have done it this weekend, but I was out of town ahead of this meeting. So if that's helpful, that would at least give you some of our feedback in terms of any parcels that are currently included that we might want the working group to take another look at whether or not those should be included. I just brought it up just so. I think it's a good question. No one would think it would have just been followed by waste. Great. I appreciate that. I'm not suggesting that you do this, but I'm asking if you were thinking to do this, that there might also be random commercial plots that you might want to change to residential. Or are there no such plots along Mass Ave? That's what we need to take this and walk it. So both ways. Both ways. Got it. That's just what I was trying to clarify. Yeah, exactly. I'll just add that I think if we put in enough of the incentives and disincentives to make it very likely that people who can build will rebuild this next use, then that makes it less likely that we need to be concerned with the parcel. Although it does, for parcel consolidation, right? You could cut. Right, but that could still happen. Right. I mean, that's ultimately, I think, what we want to have happen is so that someone could potentially purchase multiple parcels and sell them. It's not in the business district where you can build next use. Right. And some of the residential MTA, when you do next use, you have to consolidate and build next use. Right. I do have one question. I know that when we spoke, there was some question around the recommendation of the neighborhood multifamily front setback, whether that was going to be 10 feet or 15 feet. Currently, obviously, in the residential district, it's 20. And we wanted to make sure that there was enough space that you could plant a tree or, you know, appropriately landscape and make that usable in the front setback. So I'm wondering what, if any, conversation there was around 10 feet versus 15 feet in the neighborhood multifamily. There was quite a bit of conversation about it. Would you like to summarize Steve, or would you like me to go for it?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 203</summary>

> Okay. I, we, there was a lot of discussion about that. You had, you have the drought. I have the drought unit. Find the right to the right spot. Where is it here?  Anyway, I think I can remember. The discussion revolved a lot around not wanting to leave enough room that it becomes parking. Right. And the fact that it's great. We all a shared value is having the tree there, but just having the setback doesn't actually necessarily get us. The tree. Was I think part of. What I heard from the working group overall is skepticism. I think. Let to the vote. You see it from. I would add that. Also gave us the sense of it's very hard to properly. Regulate what happens to that space. And so they were cautioning us about having too much of the space. Sure. Provided what we wanted, which was shade. Because I think it was. Definite agreement amongst the working group. That is something that we want. But if we're doing a setback, we want to make sure that we're actually. Yeah. I think it was. That's where the conversation from the working group. Thank you. Is that helpful? Helpful answer.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 769</summary>

> Any other. I didn't understand the answers. The answer is 10 feet. The answer is that the working group voted for 10 feet. Because they were worried. You can plant a tree that would thrive. Gina is a difference between 15 and 10. Setback. Was not great enough to. Foster. A tree there. Or such. And also the lack of control. So having that difference. Wasn't the value of that. Okay. And we thought that. Well, no, I would say we just. I thought that. I'll leave it as I for now. Because it seemed to be the minority there. About. If we want to, let's put the trees down the street. Make. Three buckets. Out the street. Where you have enough. Space for a. Actual. Tree that can blossom. But. Kind of vigorous because that's not really within the purview. Of. The communities. But so that's why we say. That's something we should consider. Talk about. We didn't want to bog it down. What we have. As far as. Also. Encourage housing. And right now we're tying this. Everything. We've got. 10, 10, 20. How. How many lots would not get built. At 15. As opposed to 10. Any idea like what's. What's lost. With the extra five. Okay. Let's say. Lots 50 feet. Yeah. 10 on each side. Let me try different. 6000. Let's say 5000 square foot. 5000 square. Foot. What can't be built. With a 15 foot. From setback. That could be built with a 10 foot. That's fine. So you got 50 feet. It is with a 10 feet on each side. You should 30 feet. So you get a 30 foot front setback. And then. So 30 times five. Right. 150. Times four. Then that's your square footage. You lose. You can still build a house. So we build a house. But you're. You're. We don't have any F.A.R. Right. We don't have any. I'm not opposed to this. Right. Is the front side and backyard setbacks. Seems fine. But I'm still. Wondering why the five. Difference is a deal. I don't think. I want to be careful. Speaking for the committee as a whole. I don't think that. I don't think that. That's a deal breaker. Right. They went through the evidence. What they had in front of them. And decided that their recommendation. Well, I think. I think it was even. We went back and forth. And back and forth and decided. Let's just say 10 feet for now. And it might change. I personally like. I like smaller setbacks. I agree with Mr. Lau in terms of shade trees. The best place to put them. In my opinion is in the parking lane. It removes some of the pervious. Or some black surface. That causes heat islands. It gives them more space. And it doesn't depend upon the sidewalk. And. One last point. If we are going to. If we do want to take the position. That trees are a piece of public infrastructure. Then this is something. That I question. Leading it to the whims of individual property owners. So the other way. To think about it. Is that. Trees do better. If they're not in the plantings. Trees do better. If they're in the front yard. Because there's more space. More space for their roots. To spread out. And they're not confining the sidewalk. I'm not sure. Whether. We're going to narrow. A lot of those narrow streets. That run into Mass Ave. Anyhow. To do what you're doing. Which would be a great alternative. But how likely is it. That I'm going to build. A three family house. And the town is going to. Extend the sidewalk. Another ten feet. And take it out of. All those narrow streets. So. And you're right. We don't know what somebody's going to do with their front yard. Although we could try and require them. To plant a tree. In their front yard. The same way we now require people. To plant a tree. In the public right of way. So I'm just asking. Because I'm trying to sort of. Understand the push and pull. Between 10 feet. And 15 feet. Part of the thing is. Having. A tree. Box up. Or a tree island up. It doesn't narrow the street. Now there's no car there. So it's just the street. Drive lane is still the same. You're not narrowing the street. By putting a tree. On the street. Planning area. Because that's where a car would park. So your driveway is still the driveway. It doesn't change at all.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 264</summary>

> Okay. So we need to see if the town is willing. Well that's it. I think we have to make a commitment as a town. We want to do this. And that's part of the thing. I think what Steve said is look. You're asking the public utilities. And you're imposing this will onto homeowners. What the town wants to do. Or what other people want to do. And there's no way of us controlling them. To do that. Now mind you it's great when they do. Yes. It's absolutely great when they do. I think it would be interesting. To find out sooner rather than later. Whether the town is open. To doing these tree extensions. On a lot of the streets. Because if they are. I think that's a really nice solution. If they're not. Then that's not really a solution. Well I was on a committee where we talked about. Doing these dog ears. And putting. Plantings there. So that the street water. Would not go directly into a drain. And go into these little islands there. Yes. And I think those are really successful. And it narrows the street crosswalk, and it has planting areas. I think, I mean, that's stuff that we can control, and encourage, and fun, you know? And I think that's something, if you push that on a homeowner, I don't think that's going to happen, you know? Are you going to say, okay, you have to have a certain type of tree, you're going to have to maintain this tree, this whole bunch of stuff?

<details><summary>	 ? - 195</summary>

> No, you're absolutely right about that. And what I'm also hearing is that you possibly would like the working group to go back and think about this a little more. That's why I brought it up. It was a very hot subject. It was a subject of discussion. I think that, all things being equal, the working group would love there to be way more trees every year. We just didn't know how to make that happen. I just want to, again, thank the working group. There's so much work that's been done here, and I think we are, I mean, it's great that we're getting down to this level of minutiae now. I think that's exactly where we should be. And I'm excited that we've gotten to this point, and I'm certainly confident that we're going to get to a space where we all feel good about what we're putting in front of town meeting. Like I said, I think we're getting into some pretty, yeah, some pretty good details now, which is great. And it sounds like there's a consensus, yes, we want to amend the zoning bylaws so street trees are involved.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 220</summary>

> Yes, I now have that on my bill. So we've gone there, so we're now with, you know, should the front yard be another place? One thing we haven't mentioned, I don't think explicitly as part of this that we did include as part of their bonuses was an extra story if they surpassed the minimum affordable housing requirement. I don't think we've mentioned that. So for both for you guys and for the public, that is a bonus that we, I think, will include in our recommendations. We have not picked the amount beyond the 15% that would trigger that. I think we need a little more pencil sharpening to do that. But we indicated that we would like to include an extra story bonus for that. So if we started four stories for a building, and two stories for mixed use, and one story... So we also voted about stacking. And so if we had not to exceed the maximum for the zone, which is, right, six and four. So if we had two different one, two different one story bonuses, right, you could stack them together. Because of the way the commercial bonus we talked about works, you would choose. You could either do the affordable housing or the... There was actually a third bonus. Oh, yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 647</summary>

> Yes. So the ones that we had discussed were two stories, two story. We're starting with a base of a four story by right. This is Mass Ave and Broadway. Mass Ave and Broadway. Yep. Two stories for ground floor commercial. One story for extra affordable housing. And, you know, specifics don't work out yet. But one story for providing publicly accessible open space. You know, kind of amused me. But the height limit on Mass Ave was we voted six stories. And I believe Broadway for five. Broadway for five. So you can only stack it up to six or five stories on the respective corridors. Just a menu of what you want. So Broadway is five? Mm-hmm. I didn't see that. That's old. This is old? This is what just came? No, because we only have one now. We don't have two. So we didn't see it. So if Broadway is five and we want to give two story bonuses for... Mixed use. Then is the base three? Well, that's a problem, right? It was a discussion amongst the working group of should Broadway... And I believe we had a somewhat split vote on whether Broadway should be five or not. Five or six. So that's the history of how we got to where that was. So what we're left with, you only have one extra floor to do mixed use. Plus your ten foot setback. Yes. It doesn't seem like enough of an incentive. Yeah, I wonder if it should be a baseline of three on Broadway and then to get up to five. No, then we'll get five. You'll get five. They go five with commercial on the ground floor. Right. But if they don't choose to take that incentive, they can just split it three. Which is essentially what they're doing now. No, but... They could build two. They could build two and a half. Two and a half. Two and a half, okay. That dual work. Right, two and a half. Exception three. Right. So we can think of that. I'd say another thing to take back is the... May I ask... I think the bonus thing in general is something that needs to be written down. Right, and I don't know if that one just wasn't uploaded, but the latest one that was uploaded was the two. Still has a scenario one and scenario two, so I don't think we have the latest one. And you mentioned four stories, and then they don't have the latest one. What we see here is three stories. Yeah, they don't have this map. Which is fine. I know things are moving fast. Nobody's upset about it. Sorry, sorry. No, it's totally fine. I think that we should just make sure that we follow up. That would be helpful for us so that we can give you better feedback. Right. We'll have something corrected for tomorrow. Perfect. I just want to clarify. So you're saying that we should have on Broadway three stories as of right, and with commercial on the lower floor, you still get two floors bonus, so there's a total of five. So we're still maintaining five floors because we don't want six stories on Broadway, but we're still trying to encourage ground floor commercial on there so that as of right, there's three. That's what I'm just. That's what I just want to be clear about. The other question, I would ask it the other way around. Right. Would you prefer us to make Broadway six? Yes. Right. I think there are certainly, again, there was not consensus among the working group. Right. On that. Right. I think it's okay in some way for the working group to give us something, not now, but say, here are two ways to deal with Broadway, five or six. And ARB, you decide.

> But, Jim, what I'm hearing is that you like the two-story incentive for mixed use. I think we do. So in the modeling, we need to make sure that that's what we represent. So the question is, how high do you go? Yeah, is it a base three or a max of six? Right. Got it. The other thing, so what we saw was neighborhood multifamily dimensions max three stories, and it's now four. Can someone just explain what happened? Is there a bonus for four, or is it max four?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 188</summary>

> It's max four. We felt like the existing is essentially three, right, in terms of height. Right. And so we should be. Go ahead. Yeah. So it's sort of in a big shape kind of way. The idea was we were taking along the lines of having, you know, five or six stories on the borders. Then it steps down to the four stories for the neighborhood districts. And then it steps down to three, which is our two and a half story zone. So no half stories. Correct. Did you have anything else, Claire? No, I have nothing else to add. I just want to make it clear, the map that I handed out tonight is the map that you see on the screen. It's a map dated July 19th. I think the board has been with it, has been using a July 18th map. They're not very different. We can certainly have conversations about, you know, both of them at the same time, conceptually. But I want to want folks to know that the map that is linked in the agenda is the most recent map.

And if you wouldn't mind asking her to email that to the board so that Jeanne and I have that most current one. That would be great. Okay. Anything else from the working group before we move to public comment? No. Thank you very much. This has been really good to collaborate. Pardon? I said thank you for coming. Oh, yeah. Of course. And we'll see hopefully some of you tomorrow night as well for our public forum. You can come, Jeanne. I'll be there. It's on my calendar. City Hall. Town Hall.

<details><summary>	 Gwen - 464</summary>

> We'll start with Gwen. We now go to Kevin's portrait place. A couple of comments which might be very brief. I just want to address Mr. Benson's... Speak up. I'm sorry. I want to address Mr. Benson's comments about the setback in the trees. Amongst all of the discussion, Util's comment was that a 10-foot setback would not support a large tree. It would support smaller ornamental trees. But that you would have to have at least a 15-foot setback to support a larger tree. So related to that, I want to propose maybe a different way of looking at setbacks. I don't know if you guys have thought about it. Right now we're talking about no setbacks for the taller buildings and then setbacks for the lower density buildings. Tonight I walked past the Kenwood 990 Mass Ave. This is an eight-story building, but you don't really notice it. I stepped off the setback tonight. It's 30 feet. It has large locust trees in it. It's got shrubs. It's got green grass. By contrast, when you walk past some of our one-, two-, and three-story storefronts, they have a zero setback. But it doesn't feel oppressive because they're not so tall and you can see the sky. I was in East Arlington this afternoon, so I was really thinking a lot about setbacks versus building height. So maybe a different way to think about how those things interact. My final comment is I have sent an invitation to the working group, to Director Ricker, and to the members of the ARB to visit my street. Once again, I want to assure you that I'm not trying to make myself special, but I'm really concerned about how nonconforming lots and private ways work in this. Because as we've heard over and over, the point of all of this is to actually build housing. So if we're including properties within the zones where development is not feasible, we're working against ourselves. My side of the street, every lot is 3,800 square feet. And it is now, the entire street is zoned for four-story structures. We don't have curbs. We don't have sidewalks. There is inadequate parking already. The house next to me does not have a driveway. And because of the grade, there is no way to put a driveway there. So again, I really, really urge, I understand the tides and the straits. I know that you are all volunteers with real lives. But there's got to be some way to do a parcel-by-parcel visit, even if it's in a party van, that you guys all get together and drive down these streets. But there's got to be a way to see really, truly what is included in these districts. Thank you very much.

</details>
<details><summary>	 Susan Stamps - 481</summary>

> Thank you. My name is Susan Stamps, 39 Grafton Street, Arlington, member of the Town Treat Committee and the Gastric Task Force and Town Meeting Member for Precinct 3. A couple of notes about what the UTL consultant said at the working group meeting last week. What Grinnell said, that he said you need a 15-foot setback for a tree. The other thing he said was that you can prohibit parking in the setback. So that should be a reason to not have a 10 or 15, whatever size setback you want. I'm a member of Green Streets, Arlington. Green Streets, Arlington is a group we formed recently to advocate for tree canopies, healthy streetscapes, and open space to be in the MBTA zoning package for town meeting in the fall. We support multifamily housing mandates and we want to hold the past town meeting. However, right now, there are gaps in the MBTA zoning plans in that there are no provisions to help mitigate climate change, moderate heat islands, enrich Arlington's natural streetscapes, preserve or increase the tree canopy, or provide accessible open spaces. We believe it's urgent as the climate gets hotter, wetter, and more extreme that we fill these gaps in the most significant zoning that Arlington will see in decades. For example, we ask for much more room for trees in the MBTA zoning maps. Trees are not a nice-to-have. They are a have-to-have for a healthy, livable community for decades to come. Why is that? Trees absorb carbon and other pollutants from the air and give off oxygen for us to breathe. Their roots hold water, helping to prevent neighborhood flooding from heavy rains sure to increase as the years go by. They offer cooling shade so as the climate warms, we can still enjoy being outside and seeing our neighbors. They help to reduce energy use by protecting buildings from the hot summer sun and the cold winter winds. They provide habitat for our precious birds and wildlife, which have already suffered loss of habitat. They add grace and beauty to our neighborhoods and increase property values. We ask that our town specialists who focus on stormwater management, open space, and tree canopy, such as our town engineer and our tree warden, be consulted in the drawing of the zoning maps. We ask that in modeling the MBTA districts, the planners use town tools already in place, such as the street tree inventory, the tree warden's list of plantable and unplantable tree spaces, locations of large-volume gas leaks which kill trees, locations of overhead utility lines which preclude planting of large-shaped trees along the sidewalk, and heat maps. Given Town Meeting's impressive record of pro-environmental goals, we believe the MBTA zoning package will pass Town Meeting only if it has the tree canopies, green streetscapes, and open space necessary for a healthy environment. Thank you.

> Hi. I'm Elizabeth Carr-Jones. Would you like to speak up? You're outside, please. I apologize. The HVAC is very loud. It's hard to get over. Normally, people get here when you talk. No, I know. This is a challenging room, so thank you. I'll start again. I appreciate it. I'm Elizabeth Carr-Jones, 1 Lehigh Street, co-chair of the Open Space Committee, and Precinct 14 Town Meeting member. Tonight, I'm speaking as part of Green Streets Arlington, a group advocating for tree canopies, healthy streetscapes, and open space to be part of this MBTA zoning package. My role tonight is to speak to the fact that Arlington residents have consistently given high priority to the sustainable actions we're advocating. The fact that it's reflected in our planning documents and bylaws. Town goal in Arlington's master plan reads, the environment, recognizing the fragility of our open natural resources, we must ensure that Arlington's residential areas, commercial centers, and infrastructure are developed in harmony with environmental concerns. Goal number one in Arlington's Open Space and Recreation Plan reads, protect the natural environment to retain its important functions and values and help Arlington adapt to and mitigate climate change. Arlington's Tree Protection and Preservation Bylaw reads, preservation of the tree canopy and planting of replacement trees is essential to preserving the character of the tree. and aesthetic appearance of the town and maintaining quality of life and the environment in the town. Arlington's net zero action plan states by an overwhelming majority respondents view climate change as a serious crisis with 87% of respondents rating climate change as extremely important to them personally. A high priority measure for net zero buildings also promotes the planting of trees on private property. Arlington's housing production plan's five-year plan specifies equitable access to shared green spaces and healthy living environment as a priority. A recent report exploring Arlington's urban ecology stated that trees have been widely recognized as the main provider of ecosystem services in urban areas and in the town's own action plan for the MBTA communities project, preserving and expanding the town's street tree canopy is listed as a non-housing characteristic important to Arlington. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Brian McBride - 723</summary>

> I don't know if anyone wants my handout. So hello I'm Brian McBride I'm a member of the Open Space Committee and I'm on a conservation commission. Address two please. Oh sorry 36 Eastman Avenue. Thank you. So thank you to the working group for all the hard work and your countless hours and I know it hasn't been easy we think. We're proud as citizens for everything you've done and we think we're on the right track to a good plan. I think the addition that you're hearing from myself and my colleagues and Green Arlington, Green Street Arlington is that the environmental habitat, the street canopy piece is still missing. So I think that is the addition. We are supporters of additional housing. I probably can't say that too many times because there's concern about the environment being a cover for NIMBYism and that's really not the case. We really want housing to be built in Arlington. We just want it to be done in an environmentally and habitat sensitive way. My assignment for the group today is to talk about setbacks as you can see from the handout and I just maybe if we could just kind of flip through this quickly together. So we got on our bicycles the other day. We drove down Mass Ave and we took a number of pictures of different setbacks along Mass Ave primarily. It's really interesting that Winnell also kind of stumbled upon the Kentwood because that was one of the first places we went to. Obviously it's got a big setback, right, 30 feet or more. Beautiful big tree, green space, lots of shade. It was a hot day. It was much cooler walking past the Kentwood. Further down we saw other buildings that had only 25 foot setbacks and some of the great examples of this are the corner of Mill Street and Mass Ave, so-called old bio building. The assisted living facility in the heights. Beautiful 25 foot setback full of trees accessible to the public. Some nice living and there's also a similar building 264 Mass Ave which has a really lovely manicured 25 foot setback. In Brian's world this would be the place to live, right. It's got a lovely setback, it's populated with trees, it feels green, it's got public access to some degree. My deal. Maybe this is a challenge. As you dial the dial on setback further we're getting into the 20 and 15 foot setbacks and this is where it becomes, in my view, fringe, right. You can see in these buildings they do have trees. Some of them are a bit clipped, some of them are a bit small. They are providing shade. It does allow space for manicured lawns and shrubs but you're really on the fringe and if you listen to our tree warden this 15 foot mark here is really the minimum for a successful tree. It doesn't matter whether it's in setback or on the street, 15 feet. Think about a 15 foot parking space. That could be a problem. When we get to 10 and 0 feet, it's places I wouldn't want to live. This has a very harsh urban feel, it's not comfortable, it's hot. It doesn't meet the criteria I feel which is incorporating care for the planet, to have the streets and the tree canopy into our plan. I just finished with a story. It's funny that when I also went to Kentwood, we went there too, and as we stopped, it was a very hot day, we stopped under the big shade tree. There were three people sitting on a stone wall on the corner of the lot. We were looking around and they were looking next to me. We told them about setbacks and we started talking about climate change and temperature rise. We had a 15 minute conversation with people we wouldn't have met and wouldn't have been engaged with if it wasn't for this environment created by the setback to the tree. Isn't that what we want for Arlington? Isn't that how we want to connect with our neighbors and knit the community together? I think setback isn't just an architectural term, it's a way of life and I think it's important to improve on that. Thank you so much.

<details><summary>	 Allen Jones - 498</summary>

> Please. Allen Jones, 1 Lehigh Street, Precinct 14, time meeting member, Finance Committee, none of that matters. Tell me if I'm talking too loud. So, I understand, talking to members of the working group and the board and the department, that there are things that I think many of us would like to have, but can't be required, but could potentially be incentivized with things like extra stories or maybe FAR and maybe that's a relevant part, whatever, and I'm going to suggest six things that could potentially be, that I'd like the board to consider for incentivized or bonuses and only one, maybe two, are about setbacks. They all add to the natural spaces, reduce heat islands, manage stormwater runoff, and to me, most importantly, is to try to encourage the new homes to not be second-class developments. We want the new neighbors we're moving in to have the same quality of life that we all enjoy. So, you know, we don't want lesser things. So, number one, larger setbacks. I do want to, maybe 20, 25 feet, I do want to say a 10-foot setback sort of says you can't put a decent shade tree there. You don't have the option. 20-foot setback, you can't force them to put in a tree, but it allows them to put in a tree and every developer knows that trees add value to the building. I just looked it up. Three-and-a-half to 50% value by adding trees to the property. It lets them put in trees. 10-foot says you can't have a tree there, not a decent tree. So, it's set up for larger setbacks. On the public spaces, if there are setbacks, an easement for public access to allow these mini parks, parklets, little pedestrian refuges, cyclist refuges, maybe a bench or two and a trash can and a nice big shade tree. But a place for people to stop and relax, a place for the neighbors to have a little informal gathering, sit around, have a little picnic. Three, planning and maintenance of native trees, shrubs, and other perennials, particularly if they're in a designated wildlife or pollinator corridor, which I know the town's working on to be able to define this is a wildlife corridor, this is a pollinator corridor. So, those are particularly critical places. Four, green parking lots potentially require or give an incentive for at least 50% shade tree canopy to shade the parking lot or a footable tank. Permeable surfaces to control rain and storm water. Reducing the size of open parking lots to reduce heat isles through structured parking or underground parking within the footprint of the building and then incentives or bonuses for additional green space in the large developments. Just, if they have a room, let them do it, give them some sort of incentive for that. That's it. That's all sites. Only one and a half have setbacks. Thank you. Thank you so much. Anybody else?  Please.

> Hi. Thanks. I'm Mary Ellen Aronow. I'm at 22 Addison Street. I'm the co-chair of the Arlington Tree Committee. I'm also a town meeting member, precinct 8. Tonight I'm speaking as part of Green Streets Arlington. As Susan mentioned, we're a group advocating for tree canopies, helping street space and open space to be part of these NBTA community districts. Currently, we see there's important gaps in the plan with regard to green streets, open space, and tree canopy. We think the town must improve these natural concerns when developing these districts. We ask the town to commit to expand current laws in place today which are already mitigating climate forward policies. We ask the town is mindful of its long-range plans to enhance Arlington's ecology and climate resilience and bring a package to town meeting in tandem with the new NBTA community districts. The town can be successful at expanding Arlington's built environment with new multi-family housing and enhanced tree canopies, healthy streetscapes, and open space. A few current, a few zoning requirements which are right for expanding to apply to residential, multi-use, and planned unit districts. They're not just, they're not just in the business industrial zones that we could apply today. The first is an example that you already mentioned tonight, site development standards 6.3.2 which are, were added to the zoning in 2020. Shade tree coverage along main corridors. Requirement addresses heat island effects, enhance public health and walkability with proper shading. The law provides for where there is no suitable location within the public way that shade trees may be proposed in locations within the setback as determined by the tree work. And there's currently programs in town where we do this. Another is the screening and space buffer requirement in zoning section 5.2.7 which require a screen of plantings to be maintained between properties. These and potentially other modest modifications in current zoning are examples which already include provisions to help mitigate climate change, moderate heat islands, and enrich Arlington's natural streetscapes. Expanding these works toward filling the gaps currently present in the overlay district plan. It could be within a package to town meeting in tandem with the new MVA district zoning. The town will not be accessible at all. And we really thank you for all your work on this. Thank you very much.

<details><summary>	 Keith Schnevely - 634</summary>

> Anybody else? Please. Keith Schnevely. I live at 78 Webb Cowett Road in Arlington. I am the other co-chair of the Arlington Tree Committee. First of all, I'm pretty sure it's true of everybody in here. Everybody in this town except for some of the employees are very dedicated citizens, right? Tree Committee is what you guys are doing. It's really impressive that the town runs on this, right? So I really appreciate the work. I'm on the Tree Committee because the mission of the Tree Committee is to promote the protection, planting, and care of trees in Arlington. I believe in this mission deeply. So you know where I'm coming from to start with. But I'm an IT guy. Like data really matters. Getting things right really matters to me. And over the course of the last three years I've had a lot of opportunity to work at home. There was a tremendous storm in Arlington in 2021. I'm pretty sure it was. And I was wondering how much rain fell. And I went on, you know, one of the sites and I could just get Logan. It was like an inch and a half. But it was also trash day. And I had a barrel that had no top on it out in the open and it had four inches of rain in it. Turns out you can find weather stations that are very local and track them. I've been doing them for the last three years. In 2021 we had 40 inches of rain, which is about average year of rainfall. A lot of heavy rains over three inches. In 2022 we had a drought. We only got seven inches of rain in four months. Over the course of that time, between that and this year, we've actually lost 67 of our trees. This year we've had 13 inches of rain, 13 and a third, in the last month and three weeks. And we had, last year, 28 days of 90 degrees or more. This year we're up to seven. These things really worry me. And I really think that it's important to consider this as we look to the future. What we were worried about 20 years ago is coming into focus now. The atmosphere is warmer. There's longer dry periods. It's hotter when it rains. It rains hard. In our town, Claire, I don't know if you want to look at this, but we do have a GIS map that shows the heat islands in the town. If you overlay your districts, it's a very close match. And the reason is because Mass Ave has been built up over the years. There are not trees in that area. And what we want to do as tree committee is encourage the ability to plant trees in that area, especially along where, you know, so that where you have pavement, macadam, sidewalks, buildings that are made of stone that are heat-absorbing, that you have the ability to plant trees in from those and absorb the heat in those areas. So there were some really good ideas here tonight. You know, can we put added planters in front of these buildings? Could we have the setbacks? Linnell, your idea about an eight-story building that's 30 feet back doesn't have the same impact and it allows a lot of room, right? I think we need to do the housing. I think it would be really good if we had a clean plan that could pass town meetings so we can be on that, you know, fossil fuel cutting-edge. And I think if we can also increase the tree canopy, these are all things that we could be doing to enhance our climate Thank you. Anybody else wishing to speak this evening? Go ahead.

<details><summary>	 Chuck Carney - 433</summary>

> I'm Chuck Harney to Kimball Road in Arlington. First, thank you for everything that you've done and that you're doing. I didn't realize I needed to continue so that's good. Thank you for the 3D map. And I know you're balancing a ton of different perspectives. The pro-housing, just compliance, you know, and the green space. And I'm here by two points. The first is to reinforce the green space, particularly the setbacks. You know, I was there last meeting, as you guys may know, and the 10-foot setback wasn't sufficient for a tree and I don't think that's the best move. You know, my take is to make it sufficient for the tree for all the reasons that the tree committee and others have said. You know, but I look at the number, the 719 map, you're at 20,000 potential units. I know the reality is going to be less than that, but that's, you know, ten times what the base requirement is from the state. And I know we're going to do more than the base, but my comment is if we've got room for 20,000 units in this current map, give or take, then that's, that seems to me, just doing the math, if it's a volume thing, that we may have some ability to increase setbacks and therefore include, you know, more of the green space. So that's my first point. The second point is on the incentives. There's three incentives. It's the mixed use, the affordable housing, and the green space. So there's two points brought up, I think, one by the committee, one by Util, that I just want to emphasize. The first is that by the committee, these incentives may actually compete with each other so that a developer plays the game and then they optimize on one, I don't know which one, but more than likely the hype one. So that's something that I think merits some analysis or scenario planning or something. And then the second, and Util brought this up and we've talked about it, the unintended consequences of some of these incentives, e.g. empty storefronts. And we've seen some of this in Cambridge, where if you go down to Sherman Street where Massey Harvey used to be, it was a development with the front, with the first store that was a cafe, supposed to be a cafe for a good two years, it never happened, and now it's a preschool, which is fine, but I think what we want to be careful of is just empty storefronts. So, that's it. Anybody else?

> All right, seeing no other hands, we will close open forum and move to agenda item number four, which is new business. I'll turn it over to you, Claire, to see if there's anything you have on your list from the board.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire - 295</summary>

> Yeah, so I do have one thing I'd like to talk about this evening, and that is the timing of the town meeting, which seems to be, the select board seems to be sort of circling around trying to land on a date. And I think initially folks were thinking October 16th. There has been some change to that thinking, and I believe we may opt for a date, perhaps October 23rd, perhaps something after the override election. It's completely up to the select board, but again, we don't have a date for fall town meeting at this point. What we do have is an opportunity for us to submit our zoning to the state early for a review, pre-adoption review is what they call it, for a certain amount of time before we go to town meeting. I think it is an excellent opportunity for us to get this, to get our ideas, to get our zoning, really our mostly baked project in front of the state, to see how we are complying, if we are complying, and how they are sort of viewing our district. For us to get this pre-approval compliance will mean on the back end we can go that much more quickly through the MBTA community's process with the state for them to certify our plan, and also with the AG's office for them to ultimately certify our zoning by February 11th, which is the deadline for us to participate in the fossil fuel pilot. That's really the only new business I have. I think dates are still a little up in the air, but much like the zone, we're finally closing in on some of the details, and I will give any updates as I get them. Thank you.

> Great, thank you, Claire. Any questions?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 117</summary>

> Yeah, just let me go to the board for any questions, so When do you think we'll be ready to get that pre-approval? I am hoping to get to send the state a package by the third week of August. One of the things we didn't discuss tonight, that will be helpful to know, to put that package together, I think is, to what extent is the MBTA Community Zoning going to extend by itself, and what extent is it going to stay? And other than this, you rely on the current zoning bylaw. And we haven't had that discussion, but I think it would be helpful to know that sometime before you go to the state.

> Sure, understood. And this evening, or actually this afternoon, I sent some draft zoning language to Laura and to Steve on the working group so that we can get that piece of it underway, that drafting the actual language. And I did see your email to Doug. We will be going through and trying to figure out where we can take advantage of existing zoning by saying it does or does not apply, or where we would have to write new conditions. Any other questions, Gene? Kim?

<details><summary>	 Gene Benson - 34</summary>

> We were going to follow up and see how this MBTA Community's work with inclusionary housing. Have we? Yes, Gene, do you want to fill in, Kim, on the email you sent to Doug?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kim - 120</summary>

> I emailed Doug, and he says we can do it, and he's trying to figure out the best way to do it. So, by doing MBTA Community's overlay, then since we're not having a special apartment, we can still do it. We're still required, and because... There are two things. We can still require it. Doug is trying to figure out what's the best way to require it in the zoning by-law. But the other thing is, our inclusionary zoning is 15%. The state only allows 10% unless we put in some sort of study that shows 15% works. So, we can do it. We need the study, and then Doug will give us the exact wording for the by-law.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 374</summary>

> Okay, good. That's correct. And if we as a board want to go with 15%, we're going to somehow try to prove that it is not hindrance to... To development. To development. Correct. How do we do that? We do an economic feasibility analysis, or we can do what Lexington did, which is say we intend to use our inclusionary zoning unless DHCD says that it's not feasible, in which case we will revert to the 10%. I do not want to do that. I don't think that we need to do that in our zoning, but we do need to perform an economic feasibility analysis to ensure that 15% doesn't make anything unbuildable. Given the fact that we have 40 Bs in this town, where they do 25% and still manage to successfully develop projects, I'm not sure that 15% will be so onerous, but the economic feasibility analysis would determine that. And we've had a number of projects with 15%. Correct. Correct. Can I ask a question around that? Is that something that the department can perform, and that would be acceptable? Do they require a third party? And what are your thoughts on the timing for that? Is that a commitment to do an economic feasibility study, or does it have to be complete? So that's a great question. I think it's a little of both. I think it's a commitment to do the study. I think that it is, I would like for the department to be able to certify it on their own, but I would have to see what the state requires on that. For me, it's, well, for me, for the department, it really is a slam dunk. I mean, this is obviously development that we've been doing successfully for years. And just, I think, evidence of that is more than enough, but we'll have to see what they require. And just to clarify, we're gonna ask for the same AMI as we currently have in our inclusionary study. 70%? 60. 60%. Right. That's what it confirmed at. That's what we thought. 70% for homeownership. Okay. Got it. Yes, the intent was to not change from what is currently. Exactly. That was our understanding. Being developed. Yes.

> Any other questions for Claire on the pre-approval or timing? So that's something that we'll keep in close contact with Eric Helmuth from the select board about. I, so that the board knows, I am going to send him the list, the list that keeps growing, of our non-MBTA communities or MBTA community supportive separate warrant articles so that the select board has a preview of those as well. And I'll also, again, let him know that the 23rd of October is a preferred date of the board a little bit later so that we can get the feedback from the state, make any modifications, hold the hearings, and then present to that meeting. Any other new business from any board members starting with Steve? Gene? Ken? I don't have any either.
