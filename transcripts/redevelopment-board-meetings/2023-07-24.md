<details><summary>Please, summarize the Redevelopment Board meeting.</summary>

> The Redevelopment Board meeting on July 24th was chaired by Rachel Fenberry and attended by board members Steve Rappalach, Eugene Benson, Ken Low, and Director of Planning and Community Development Department, Claire Ricker. The meeting began with a review of the meeting minutes from February 27th, April 3rd, and June 26th, 2023, which were all approved. The board then moved on to discuss the MBTA communities discussion, with a focus on zoning and development. Claire Ricker presented a 3D model of potential zoning changes along Mass Ave and Broadway. The board also discussed the possibility of extending the current zoning for commercial and industrial to all residential areas. The meeting concluded with a discussion on the timing of the town meeting and the need for a pre-approval compliance review from the state.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the MBTA communities discussion by providing a list of concerns and a summary of the responses</summary>

> 1. Concern: The 10-foot setback was not sufficient for a tree. 
Response: The board acknowledged this concern and suggested that if there's room for 20,000 units in the current map, there may be some ability to increase setbacks and therefore include more green space.

2. Concern: The incentives for mixed use, affordable housing, and green space may compete with each other, leading to developers optimizing one over the others.
Response: The board acknowledged this concern and suggested that it merits some analysis or scenario planning.

3. Concern: The unintended consequences of some of these incentives, such as empty storefronts.
Response: The board acknowledged this concern and suggested that they need to be careful of creating empty storefronts.

4. Concern: The need for an economic feasibility analysis to ensure that 15% affordable housing requirement doesn't make anything unbuildable.
Response: The board agreed to perform an economic feasibility analysis. They also mentioned that given the fact that there are 40B projects in the town where they do 25% affordable housing and still manage to successfully develop projects, they don't believe that 15% will be so onerous.

5. Concern: The need to clarify whether the department can perform the economic feasibility analysis and whether it would be acceptable.
Response: The board expressed their desire for the department to be able to certify it on their own, but they would have to see what the state requires.

6. Concern: The need to confirm the same Area Median Income (AMI) as currently in their inclusionary study.
Response: The board confirmed that the intent was to not change from what is currently being developed, which is 60% AMI for rental and 70% for homeownership.
</details><details><summary>What concerns were raised by the board?</summary>

> The board raised concerns about the zoning of corner lots. Specifically, they discussed how corner lots have two front yards and two side yards, with no designated rear yard. This could potentially lead to issues with buildings being too close to each other. The board also discussed the idea of extending commercial zoning along side streets, which could impact residential areas. They wanted to ensure that any changes to zoning regulations would be fair to both commercial and residential areas.
</details><details><summary>What is the proposal for setbacks, building heights and trees for the MBTA communities working group?</summary>

> The MBTA communities working group has proposed varying setbacks and building heights depending on the specific area within the district. For example, in the neighborhood multifamily district, they propose a 10-foot front setback, 10-foot side setback, and 20-foot rear setback, with a maximum building height of four stories. In the S7 Broadway district, they propose a zero-foot front setback, 10-foot side setback, and 20-foot rear setback, with a maximum building height of six stories. The group has also discussed the importance of trees in these areas, with one member noting that a 15-foot setback is the minimum for a successful tree. However, specific requirements or incentives for tree planting have not been detailed.
</details><details><summary>What are the concerns and proposals concerning business parcels?</summary>

> The discussion revolved around the potential rezoning of business parcels along Route 2, from Pleasant Street up to Lexington, near St. Camilla's. The working group had considered this idea but did not make a formal vote or recommendation on it. The idea was to focus more on high transit areas, such as the corridor along Mass Avenue. The group also discussed the potential of expanding current laws to apply to residential, multi-use, and planned unit districts, not just in the business industrial zones. This would include site development standards for shade tree coverage along main corridors and screening and space buffer requirements between properties. These modifications would help mitigate climate change, moderate heat islands, and enrich Arlington's natural streetscapes.
</details><details><summary>Please, list who spoke during the public comment period and summarize what they said.</summary>

> During the public comment period, one individual spoke. The person raised two main points. First, they expressed concern about the 10-foot setback not being sufficient for a tree and suggested that it should be increased to allow for more green space. They also pointed out that the current map allows for up to 20,000 potential units, which is significantly more than the state's base requirement, suggesting that there might be room to increase setbacks without significantly impacting the potential for development. Second, they discussed the three incentives (mixed use, affordable housing, and green space) and raised concerns that these incentives might compete with each other, potentially leading to developers optimizing for one at the expense of the others. They also expressed concern about the potential for empty storefronts as an unintended consequence of these incentives.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize what Gwen, Susan Stamps, Alan Jone, Elizabeth Carr Jones and Chuck Carney said with separate reponses for each.</summary>

> Gwen Noyes expressed concern about the proposed setbacks for new developments. She suggested that larger setbacks for taller buildings might be more appropriate, as they would allow for larger trees and green spaces. She also urged the board to consider the feasibility of development on nonconforming lots and private ways.

Susan Stamps, a member of the Town Tree Committee and the Gas Leak Task Force, advocated for the inclusion of provisions to mitigate climate change, moderate heat islands, enrich Arlington's natural streetscapes, preserve or increase the tree canopy, and provide accessible open spaces in the MBTA zoning plans.

Alan Jones expressed concern about the potential impact of the proposed zoning changes on the character of Arlington. He suggested that the board consider the potential impact of the proposed changes on the town's character and quality of life.

Elizabeth Carr Jones, a member of the MBTA Communities Working Group, provided an update on the group's progress. She mentioned that the group is considering different ways to deal with setbacks and building heights, and is also considering the potential impact of the proposed changes on the town's character and quality of life.

Chuck Carney, a member of the MBTA Communities Working Group, provided an update on the group's progress. He mentioned that the group is considering different ways to deal with setbacks and building heights, and is also considering the potential impact of the proposed changes on the town's character and quality of life.

</details><details><summary>What conclusions did the board make about the communities working group proposals and map?</summary>

> The board discussed the proposals and map presented by the communities working group. They agreed with the idea of focusing on the high transit bus lines along the Mass Avenue corridor. They also discussed the potential of rezoning the frontage road along Route 2, but decided to focus more on areas with commercial business proximity and access to public transit. The board also discussed the need for an economic feasibility analysis to ensure that a 15% inclusionary zoning requirement would not make anything unbuildable. They also discussed the need to consider how the MBTA Community's work with inclusionary housing. The board agreed to send a package to the state for pre-approval by the third week of August. They also discussed the need to consider setbacks and other zoning regulations for corner lots.
