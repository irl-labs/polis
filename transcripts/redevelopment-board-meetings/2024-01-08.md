<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    * 7:45pm The Board will discuss the changes they require from the developer in order to meet the conditions of the original special permit granted by the Board. Representatives of the architect and/or the developer are expected to attend.  Let's move right into our next item, which is 882 to 892 Massachusetts Avenue. Claire, do we have anyone from the development team joining us this evening?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do. Mr. John Murphy is here from the development team. Great. Thank you, John. If you wouldn't mind coming forward in case we have any questions. Any of the front seats would be perfect just so that we can pick you up on the microphone. Thank you very much. And so this is a discussion. We have not reopened the special permit yet, but we are identifying several items that deviated from the approved special permit. And the request was made for the development team to come in to speak about the mitigation of those items. And I will turn it over to Director Ricker, who has been communicating with the owner and the development team to provide an update.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Claire Ricker - 161</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. So at the board's request, I have spoken with the architect, which is Market Square Architects, which is a different architect who had started the project. And I've also spoken with Mr. Murphy here, who is the development consultant working with the owner on the project about the issues that the board had brought up in the previous meeting. I think most significantly what we were looking at was the aluminum storefront. At the windows, we were looking at the white accent, which was not part of the original renderings in the permitting phase of the project. And I think we were looking at the exterior penetrations on the Mass Ave side for the vents, for the dryer vents that are currently white. But the developer has assured me that the white accents will be painted to match the building as the board requested. The aluminum storefront, unfortunately, is unable to be painted at this time. And doesn't ultimately...</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can paint it. Sorry? We can paint it. Oh, you can paint it. It's just that there's more weather restrictions. Sorry.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Claire Ricker - 128</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were concerns about painting the aluminum storefront that wasn't installed. And also, while the developer is certainly willing to paint the dryer vents on the exterior the same color as the building, there are some mitigating factors that went into the decision to do those penetrations, which are part of the construction drawings. And I've included a memo from Sarah Suarez, the assistant director, that went through the construction drawings and showed those penetrations, as well as there's also a memo in the packet from Jim Feeney, who has been working with the developer and the owner on the regulatory agreement with EOHLC and answered some of those questions that we had about location and size of affordable units. And I think that's the introduction. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. So what I'd add, do you have any, John, do you have anything else to add before I turn it over to the board for any questions on what was presented?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Murphy - 10</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the last one that wasn't mentioned was the signage.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 63</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. That was the last item. The tenant in there is taking the lead on that. So we're working on their signage. We know about the sign bylaws, and it goes into that. So we'll just assist them when they come through the bread channels to make sure that that happens. Great. We just have to do our work. Appreciate the update. </blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Murphy - 503</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can provide a little just quick color or background on a couple of these things, if it's helpful. Sure. So the white trim boards, we did actually already start this. So if anyone drove by on the lot one side, it is underway. We have a boom lift on site, so any day that weather is permitted, we can do it. They've prepped a lot of the areas. We're still trying to get back in touch with the side yard team to find out. We'll now obviously pick up on it. And we're just trying to figure out why that happened. Okay. But we are part of it. Same with the storefront. That is more sensitive to temperature. We just can't paint it. We just, unlike the trim, we just have to wait, really, until consistently over 50 degrees. So the affordable and the vets kind of play a little bit into the same thing. We really ended up with under 700 square feet. If you remember, we brought the building back off the property line, but didn't move the building back. If you remember, it was almost four years ago. And we went to go build everything out. The wall thickness isn't anything. We actually didn't even end up with a single unit in the whole building. Over 700 square feet. Basically, 525 and 689. And then, so the dryer vents, this was, I mean, to be completely upfront and honest, something that we never planned on or didn't plan on. You know, we were in front of the wall. It was kind of just a rendering design. We went out and did the full MVP sets and a couple of other things that kind of go into that design. Every single unit's got two. It's all electric building. So every single unit's got two heads, two mini splits, all of our line sets. We packed as much as humanly possible in all of our walls. We also have mitigation from an environmental issue. We have certain vets, the DEP permitted, that sometimes you can do on the outside of the building. We pack them in our walls. It's kind of an extra mitigation factor just in case those vents actually go up through the units. You can't see them from the street. But that's one of the other factors that went in. And I guess when the professionals designed this part of the building, that was the only place that they thought they could realistically go. And then we submitted our plans to the building department, and we know that they go through all the departments. And again, it wasn't something we were trying to do or not do. We just kind of assumed we didn't get any questions on anything at the time that we were good to go. So it wasn't something, I mean, to be honest, when we saw the dry vents, we all were like, you know, oh, we weren't thinking about it, to be honest.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 24</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. That's it. Appreciate the update. So let's take comments from the board relative to the plans that have been presented, starting with Ken.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kin Lau - 181</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you for acknowledging the fact that the white, I'm assuming that's plastic trimmings. PVC. PVC will be painted per color. One of the major concerns I have is with the transition of the colors. When you transition, say, from a certain color to an accent color or a different color, I've always transitioned it on the inside corner. I've never transitioned it on the outside corner. It's almost really hard to do. It doesn't look. It makes the building paper thin. When you transition it onto the outside corners, I mean, into the inside corners, it looks like blocks or modules, and that's what you essentially showed us. In your rendering. Excuse me for my cough on the air. So I acknowledge the fact that you're going to paint the white strips back to the original color, and you will paint the storefront to its darker color. I would suggest you submit that into the planning board. I just don't want regular paint, because it will just peel off and speckle in a couple of years, especially on aluminum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did have to go get, it has over a 10, 12 a year. It's a very special paint. Someone had to dry it.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kin Lau and John Murphy and Others - 930</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's fine. I just want you guys to submit that in, so we know you're using a high quality paint that's appropriate for the storefronts. And then with the panels. Sorry, before you leave that first comment. So you're also requesting, maybe even if you wanted to turn your laptop around, because I think that's really illustrative. You're looking at this area for them to paint to match. Yeah. Can you turn that around so John can see that? I know we don't have it up on the screen. I can see it. Okay. See how on the existing building, you have it, the color changing right at the outside corner of the building. Yeah. And you're rendering, which is correct, which it should be that way. It turns that, the face color turns and goes into the inside corner. Yeah, I see what you're saying. See, so it makes it look like a mass. Like a volume. Okay, as opposed to just slivers. And that makes a big difference, how the building looks. Claire, do you have the photo that the architect drew, that was submitted to you, that was supposed to show the final changes? I thought these were it. No, that's from the very first rendering. But what he did was, because it's even more... I don't have it up, I'm sorry. That wasn't part of the package that we had. No, it wasn't. It was part of the package. What he did was, he looked at the old rendering, used the existing photo, because it's more lifelike than a render, and redid the colors. I'll take and make a note to go back and look at that transition to see. And I apologize, I should have that drawing. To see if he did work that in or not, is my point. But I see what you're saying. I mean, if you see these volumes, when the color turns the corner and dies on the inside, it makes it look like a solid massing. But when you do it the outside corner, especially that corner there, everybody sees going up and that's that. It's a pretty predominant elevation. I mean, that's a big thing for me, okay? I mean, what I would say is, we have the boom lift there as long as we need it, and now is the time to call these things out. Now, but are these... Is that ethos, or is it... It's under the certain type of cement board, porous, whatever. There's like three or four different kinds. So it's a cement board? Yeah. So it can hold all of that. Okay, so you're using a high-quality cementitious paint. Yes. Okay, that's fine. That will work. Yeah. Okay. That would be... If you can give me that rendering, the latest set of renderings, or... I will share it. I have no problem marking it up. Probably just to avoid... Just so there's no, any confusion. Is that okay? I think that's fine, Ken. All right, so I don't mind marking it up, saying this is what it is, and I'll pass it along to the rest of the board so they can take a look at it. So it's not just me. I'm just somebody that I brought up that I, you know... And then as far as the louvers that you have to the outside, some of them are dryer vents and some of them are bathroom vents, right? I believe so, sir. So there's two that are exhaust, and is there one that's intake? Jeff, want to make a... Jeff, want to make a... Without looking at the plans, there's a better chance than not they are correct. They stick out right now a little bit, okay? And I think by painting them may not be satisfactory to the board, just to have them painted out. Could I suggest that maybe you can bring some samples of different types of louvers that might be painted out to match? And I would highly recommend bringing a sample of that louver in so we actually see it. And I'm not trying to nitpick everything here, but I'm just trying to find ways for you to get out of this situation here. These are purely my recommendations right now, okay? I haven't talked to the board at all about this, and I'm not sure what their feelings are, but I'm saying that if you can come up with something that looks nicer, okay? I've seen intakes and exhausts where it's maybe round with cylindrical stuff in it, or if it's a flat panel that comes out straight and they just suck in from the side so it just looks like a recess or something that scoots out. There's many ways of looking at this, or even as a custom thing, not leaving it the way it is right now. Are there any other projects that the board is seeing that they particularly like that they can move towards because there aren't any more than a few options here, just in the spirit of moving specific? Off the top of my head, I can't think of one right now as a CM. But I would go back and challenge your architect to look at exhaust movers that go on existing multifamily buildings. I'm sure there's a handful of the stuff that he can find and submit those cuts and whatever you guys decide upon, as far as acceptable, I would order one so we have it here. And that's all I have right now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Kim. So thank you, Kim. That was very thorough. I appreciate it. And I appreciate your efforts already to move forward on mitigating these factors. That goes a long way coming in this evening. Are we preparing this evening to talk about some of the affordability questions, or are we going to set that aside for later? Now would be, if there are any questions, I know that, Claire, you've spoken with Jim Feeney and obviously provided the memo for us. So if we were going to speak about that, tonight would be the time.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Claire Ricker - 545</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. So I was just hoping you could flesh out for me a little bit more what happened. What happened? In terms of which part of that? So I understand that, as I understand it, there are some questions about the appropriateness of the size of units as relates to the other units in the building, as well as location of units. Could you talk about selection of units, why you think those units are appropriate, and what happened from the original approvals that got us to this point where the questions are arising at all? I'd have to go back and look at the original plans that got to get approved. Were they labeled on that? So I don't believe they were labeled on the original plans. I don't believe they were. Can I interject? Please do. I believe that they were labeled, but the sizes weren't indicated on the plan. But it almost doesn't matter because our decision said it has to meet the requirements of the bylaw for affordable housing and they have to be dispersed throughout the building. So no matter where it was in the plans, that didn't matter because that's not what the decision was. I think that was the point. It sounds like no one, including anyone in the planning department at the time or the agency that is on some of the test lists that we hired even knew about the 700 square foot rule. No one seemed to know about it, including ourselves. So in hindsight, that specific approval note, probably we couldn't have even had in there, obviously, just to cross that off the list. And then I think the original, weren't they even stacked originally? They aren't stacked now. I mean, they're dispersed across floors. They're across floors and locations. Right. So they're across floors. comfortable with that. I would be surprised if no one flagged the 700 square feet. I understand that your units have shrunk. I would more typically expect to see a range of unit sizes that reflected the range of unit sizes in the building as opposed to as opposed to one particular size. I don't know I don't know if there's anything that you could do to mitigate the situation at this point. Are there people in the units? In one or two of them, yes, and I will say there's none of them are deemed the smallest unit, but one is also deemed the biggest unit. They're all kind of in the middle across floors across locations and when this was being kind of moved around, one of them was actually requested by one of the people moving in because they liked the way the light came through the back of the building, to be honest. This is also why the state's kind of been involved with it, and the town manager, so we're kind of taking guidance from the state agency and the town manager at this point, which was kind of supposed to be the point of being made to hire an agency the entire time because they're experts on this. There's a reason why those exist, it's what they do all day every day. So I don't know much more I can say about that.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 75</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, okay. But I think they are being deemed to be floating or something, so it's a matter of... That's what your convenience memo indicated. So that's helpful. So I will leave it there for now. I appreciate that they're deemed to be floating. I do have concerns about the process, but with people in the units, it's... I wouldn't want to ask people to move out of units they have already moved into. Great.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 283</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene. Yeah, just following up on the affordable housing piece, I should just remind you, if you've forgotten, I was the one person on the board who voted no on issuing the special permit for this project. On the affordable units, the special permit says the owner shall work with the Department of Planning and Community Development to comply with all the requirements of the Zoning By-law affordable housing requirements, and I know when this started, the staff was different at Planning and Community Development. What was the interaction with DPCD during the process that would meet the requirements of the special permit? Well, it's pretty simple. We reached out to them to get started and said, where do you reckon we start? We haven't dealt with this specifically in this town before, and they said you should hire one of these couple agencies. We took the recommendation off that list, hired them, and we were told that they would also work with the town and guide us through that. And that was it? And that was it. Because you're supposed to hire them to shuttle you through the process of the state and the town. We were recommended, and so we hired them. And do you know if they had any more interactions with the Department of Planning and Community Development? I don't. Yeah, I think it would be helpful to understand what that was. But I have no other questions other than that. Do you mind if I ask one? Please. Do you recall what the agency was, what the company you hired was? I can look it up in my email. Okay, that would be great. Thank you. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 177</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve? So I guess I've got two topics. One is I was actually happy to see in Mr. Feeney's memo the mention of floating units, because I've read some of the deed restrictions for other inclusionary units that have been permitted by this board, and they typically have something, a section about compliance, which says that if a tenant no longer meets the income criteria, then the property owner has a response obligation to bring the unit back into conformance within a year, which to me sounds like either the tenant's got to make less money or the tenant has to move. So the fact that there is flexibility in the units where you could just, if one falls out of compliance, you could allocate another one. That seems like a good thing. I also agree with Mr. Lau regarding the venting movers. I know there are models that sit flush against the building and have a smaller profile. I think something like that might blend in a little better. That's all I have. Thank you. Steve?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 255</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MCO housing services. Okay. Thank you. My comment, I believe that my colleagues have already addressed all of the items. Just on the exterior penetrations, if we can't find something that is much less objectionable than what is currently there, then I think we're going to need to talk about building a chase inside the interior of the unit for those to vent. Again, to what Ken and Steve have suggested, if you can come back to us with something that is much less in keeping with what you would see in the facade facing the back alley, than what we would see on Mass Ave. with regard to the shape and the distance that those actually come off of the vertical surface of the building. I'm open to seeing if you're able to come up with something that is much less obtrusive. Otherwise, again, this was not shown in the rendering. It really detracts from the overall look of the building significantly. Like I said, it looks like the side of a building that should be facing an alley with regard to those louver penetrations. It's just not acceptable for Mass Ave. Again, I'm open. If we could set, whether it's the next meeting or the meeting after that, which you and your architect feel that you can come back with a proposal, but painting them alone is not going to be sufficient in my point of view. I know that Steve and Ken and I have all expressed that that is our desire.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Various - 190</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senator Sheyna and Gene, do you have any other thoughts on the louvers? I agree with what's been said. Okay. So if you're agreeable with that. I just have one follow-up question. Please. We do do work in other towns, too. Do we know how we did these? We got to this point because the plans did go through every department. They call these out and they say to me. It's not like you're trying to be devious or anything. I'm more just saying we're sitting here thinking we're good to go because these went through every department, including the planning department. There is significant visual element on the facade, and we approved a facade that did not show these vents and louvers. If there is a significant deviation, much like what we're calling out here, which are the paint colors and the louvers, which become a significant architectural element with the quantity that you have on this facade, then you are required to come back in front of the redevelopment board for a review of any modifications that are made to the facade. That's the step that didn't happen.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 355</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything else? It sounds like the follow-up that we have, just to be clear, we will circulate a copy of the rendering that was recently prepared by the current architect so that Ken can mark that up to ensure that the paint transitions were more akin to what was shown in the approved rendering. We'll also, if you could let us know whether, again, it's the next meeting or the first meeting in February, I believe that those meeting dates are, let me give those to you, January 22nd and February 5th. If you could let Claire know which of those two meetings you would like to come back and discuss alternate vent and louver penetration options with us, we will have you back on the agenda for that item. And those are the two. And in the future, we will see your tenant's signage applications. And I appreciate and understand that you're working with them on that. And I'll just say it would also speed up for those meetings, if anyone does have any preferred or suggestions from any of the projects, to send them to Claire, because we're going to look at all options. Sure. We're not necessarily... If I can think of one, I will include with the returned marked up color. Okay. Can I add one more request? Please. Can you ask the architect to give me a sketch and model, please? No. I want to make that a requirement for all new projects going forward. I just want to add it to our database. Yes. Okay. Anything else? If they don't use SketchUp, would there be another one? If they use the... If they use Revit, they can export it to SketchUp. Export it to SketchUp. It's a simple thing to do. I don't know how to do it, but it's a simple thing to do. Okay? And if there's any question about it, they can reach out to the department. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much for coming in this evening. I appreciate it. Thank you. Okay. Absolutely. We're going to take a brief couple-minute recess. Thank you all.</blockquote>

All right. Thank you for everyone for bearing with us while we took a short recess. We'll now move to agenda item number three, which consists of the citizen warrant articles. Now we'll turn it over to Director Ricker to let us know who we will be hearing from tonight.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Great. So tonight we're going to hear from a working group of the Arlington Affordable Housing Trust, the Affordable Housing Overlay Working Group. We will also be hearing two suggestions from James Fleming, who has submitted and has presentations related to his petition. But I think we should start with the Affordable Housing Overlay presentation. And with us tonight is Karen Calvert, who will be giving it. I should also tell the board that I just emailed you all copies of these presentations. So if you'd like to follow along, but I also have it up here on the screen. Great. Thank you so much.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Karen Calvert - 2936</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much for taking the time. I am here as a representative of this working group. I also chair the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. This is actually a citizen's working group. I'll tell you who's on it and why it was structured this way in a minute. I have 13 slides. The first 10 are about why we need it. And I'm going to go real fast through them. I'd be glad to take your questions. I'll suggest we hold them until the end because maybe they'll get answered. And then there's three slides about what we're proposing for the overlay. And I'll go through those however speed you want to. Great. Thank you. This is the citizen working group, which includes people who essentially have some technical expertise because we were looking to pull together this pretty complex problem to solve. So we wanted to kind of get at it quickly. As you can see, Mr. Revelak is part of the working group because of his depth of knowledge on zoning code. Erica Schwartz, who chairs the Housing Corporation of Arlington. Myself, I'm an affordable housing professional, as is Beth Elliott. And Phil Tedesco, who also is on the trust, but is actually representing the working group and not a member of it on a pro bono basis so that we could move on with it. So that's the group. Another lawyer from his firm is working with us. So why do we need this? There's some just basic facts about what kind of affordable housing we have in town that I wanted to share so that we can remind ourselves why we need to do this. We have about 700 units that are public housing. Those were built between 1940 and 1983, along with 146 units of public, of section eight, which is privately owned, but has a similar income level. Those are typically very low income people live in those properties. There's been times when our conversation here is like, we just need more of that, which would be great. But the federal government does not subsidize the construction or long-term subsidy of projects like that anymore. So that's not really an option. We have the Housing Corporation of Arlington, which has created 150 units over a period of about 20 to 25 years. They have additional projects in development that are expected to add at least 44 more affordable units. So they'll be increasing their contribution and they've stepped up their capacity. There are many things that this would make it easier for them to do what they do as well as attract additional affordable housing. And then we've gotten about 142 units from predominantly two tools, which are inclusionary zoning law, which requires 15% affordability when you develop market rate, multifamily housing of six units or more and 40 B, which I know has been a complicated topic in this town, but it is a way that we are increasing this number because 25, 20 to 25% of all units in either 40 B projects are affordable. We don't need to subsidize those. Those are cost subsidized by the developers from the profit on the market. So that's how we get those two tools are how we get developers to pay for affordable housing. We won't get enough that way, but it's an important tool. The Commonwealth passed a law in 1968 that requires every community to have 10% of their housing stock affordable. This is 40 B it's like number of the law. It's what led to the permitting process that developers can use or that towns can proactively use to create affordable housing in their community. Arlington is currently at six, 6.37%, according to the published subsidized housing inventory. I didn't get a chance today to check with Claire, whether we have additional units coming in, but sometimes there's a process to add units, but we're about 741 units shy of the 10% required. It's just helpful to see where we are. At least 75 other communities have met this requirement. We have a lot of tools in our toolbox and they're growing. We have a local housing authority. We have those two laws I just talked about. We have passed the community preservation act and invest at least 10% of those dollars in affordable housing each year. It tends to be a little more, but not a third. At this point, we do have a community development corporation in town and the housing corporation of Arlington, which is a huge asset. We have now an affordable housing trust fund, which is new, as you know, we passed accessory dwelling units recently, which creates one more option for lower cost housing, not capital A affordable housing, but more modest pricing. Potentially we have passed a home rule petition to create a real estate transfer fee that would fund the affordable housing trust, which is critical to our longterm impact. That requires the legislature to act. There is a discussion at the state level about that. There, I hope that we have the opportunity to get that passed on a statewide basis this year, or at least pass the home rule petitions that are in front of the legislature, but they have not seen fit to do that yet. And we are hoping to bring to town meeting in the spring and affordable housing. So the affordable housing trust fund created a five year action plan. A year ago now. And one of the primary strategies was to create more affordable housing because of the gaps in the acute crisis that you all know about. Number one action under that strategy. This is just the infographic that shows the whole strategy is predictable permitting. Right. And so the next few slides come from some slides that the trust fund created about that strategy to help understand what it is, why we need predictable permitting and how it contributes to attracting developers who can leverage subsistence affordable housing is basically a math problem. By definition, affordable housing is housing that the market will never create because it costs too much to build and operate that housing for low income people to be, to be supported by the rents that low income people can afford to pay. When we did the action plan for the trust, we estimated 40 to 400 to $500,000 of subsidies necessary for every rental unit. That seems extraordinarily high, but this is the market we're in. There've been some globe articles in the last two weeks that I think are paying that number at six, six 50, six 50, six 50. That may be the total cost of bill, but at any rate, we don't have a lot of subsidy as a town. And so if we just subsidize affordable housing units ourselves, we will not get very far. There are two ways to subsidize affordable housing. One is to get developers to pay for it. I'm going to talk about one on the right first, real quick. That's those two laws I just talked about. It's 40 B and it's inclusionary zone. We have not gotten a lot of affordable housing out of our inclusionary zoning law because we have not been permitting multifamily housing, even at six units, not much. We've gotten one to two units a year over the first 20 or so years. We've had that law. MBTA communities is expected to advance that by allowing. and more multi-family housing in the districts where it is affected. So we hope that that will unleash some of those smaller developments, a unit here, a unit there, two units here, two units there, but there won't be too many parcels that are larger that will be opened up for larger development in the amputee community zones. So we need something else, and here's why. Before you go to that next slide, before I just go back real quick, we want to leverage state and federal subsidies. There are enormous amounts of subsidy that are awarded every year to other communities. We have only three times in history obtained these subsidies in Arlington. Those were the three pictures you saw at the beginning, and you'll see them back at the end. You can go to the next one, because I'm gonna show you. I didn't update this slide, I made it initially in 2022. In just the first eight months, there was $435 million awarded to 31 other communities. We didn't even have a proposal in front of the state, and many, many, many years, we have not had a proposal in front of the state. We do right now, because the HCA has 10 Sunnyside going in in February, and hopefully that would get funded, if not this year, then in the next round. Their last project, though, Downing Square Broadway Initiative, I just want you to see the power of the state and federal subsidies. That project had 4% of the cost paid for by the town. 13% will be supported by, will be a mortgage loan that will be supported by the rents paid by tenants, and the rest is state and federal subsidies. So you can see how critical it is to get this kind of leverage, if we want to have a meaningful impact on affordable housing creation. But, well, let's, let me follow my script here. We spoke to a dozen or two affordable housing developers, and you all have them amongst your ranks, but I don't think we talked to Shana at the time, about what it would take for them to come to Arlington and build that kind of affordable housing using those resources. There were four answers, and it wasn't surprising at all. They need sites that are big enough for the size of project that DHCD will, Housing Limitable Communities will fund. That tends to be 35, 40 units and up. They really, these deals are complex enough that the costs of doing them do not make justifiable on smaller deals, and the state just does not use these resources for smaller developments for the most part. Funding, that 4% is not necessarily representative. That's a very low contribution. That was a very, very good deal for the town. We need to put something in. We'll need to show that we're supportive of the project. Permits, which, you know, 40B is really the only tool a developer has, other than the process, which can be long and unpredictable, and so that permits is what we're trying to address with this bylaw. And then, of course, alignment, the town speaking with one voice. This is important to us, and this is what we want, and so we're trying to, at every turn, have all the bodies who really have a stake in affordable housing development, housing development, aligned. So this is the background. What is the proposal? Let me slow down just a little bit. What we're proposing, the working group is proposing, is an overlay that would apply throughout the town, so it's not to apply it to one neighborhood or one district and not others, but it would require a high percentage of deed-restricted affordable housing and would allow some income mixing to promote housing diversity and inclusion. What that means is we're not asking or suggesting that you have to have 100% affordable housing to qualify, but you have to have a high percentage. We'll talk about specifically what that is. But the rest of the development can have moderate-income housing, or it could have market-grade housing, which would cross-subsidize. It creates some income diversity, but it can also create more inclusion by not segregating low-income housing from all other kinds of housing. What makes it work are those developments with enough units to attract state and federal subsidies, and therefore, we need to have a transparent path to permitting buildings of that size. We did some back-and-forth with what parcels are there, how big do they have to be, how many units could you fit on parcels of what size, and sort of ballparked about a half an acre, or about 20,000 square feet as about the minimum size to create a development of sort of smallest size that could get permitted, and then sort of looked at where are those parcels throughout town, and there are many in residential districts, but there are also many in commercial and industrial zones, and so we need to talk about how this applies in those zones as well. How will we think about different zoning districts? Our principle here is that we wanna kind of treat every district the same, in that there's an additional height that you can achieve in every district, but it's triggered off of the underlying district. Same would be true for setbacks, so I'll talk about that more specifically. Let's go back to affordability. There is some room to go a little higher, a little lower here, but what we thought would be a good starting point would be to propose that at least 70% of the units have to be deed restricted to be available to people earning at or below 60% of their immediate income, which is a relatively low income level, but it is the income level that those subsidies I talked about require, so it aligns nicely with our goal of getting state and federal money. 70%, as I said, could go a little up, a little down. No specific district. Two stories more than whatever's allowed under the existing zoning as well is proposed. The minimum setbacks would be driven by the underlying setback, or if there happens to be a lot of non-conforming uses that are closer to the lot line, then you could have the average of the prevailing lot line, or setback, excuse me. On parking, parking takes up very valuable lot square footage, and so we wanted to try to be as aggressive as possible on parking. We'd like to propose half a space per unit in residential districts with no parking minimum in commercial districts. We understand that conversation about this is gonna be important. These numbers are not coming from nowhere, and actually I think Steve is better at stating sort of the background on this, but HCA has data from their affordable housing projects that show that about half a space per unit is what's required in their developments. We have data from market rate projects that are a little bit higher, and there seems to be a lower parking utilization in low-income projects because of the lower car ownership rate. And then finally, we're very aware that our commercial and industrial districts have sort of potentially untapped potential that's very important to this board and to others to sort of leverage as much as possible, and we don't have a perfect solution for that, to be completely honest. We know this conversation was had with respect to MBTA communities. In this case, obviously there's a higher top purpose here, and a much higher amount of affordable housing. We think it's probably doable to include may include or shall include one floor of commercial or community space, and we can talk about that, why I'm including community space. When I first talked about this with Claire, she said, hey, our B's gonna want two floors. And I said, okay, which I understand and would love to see, but I'll ask you to turn to your colleague who's an affordable housing developer about whether that would be attractive or not, whether it would undermine the purpose of attracting affordable housing developers, because financing that space is quite challenging. And if I'm a developer, I would point, I would just come back and say, where is the market? Show me the market for that. And the town can decide this is really important, but we might need to get creative with financial solutions as well that are taking some of that risk from a developer. It's common that a developer, an affordable housing developer doing commercial space will be asked by all their funders to master lease that space and guarantee the rent. Sometimes a third party does that because it's important to them. Sometimes a city or a housing authority will do that. So those are sort of the preliminary assumptions for discussion and feedback. We would love to be able to get this to Springtown meeting. We know that this is not a quick and easy conversation. We know there's a lot of support for affordable housing, but there's a reason it's not easy to create and larger density can be a difficult conversation. This is the timeline we are proposing to try to meet, which is we're here on January 8th, speaking with you. The warrant closes at the end of the month. We would have a warrant article and we would have at least two public forums over the next two months to talk with the public. First about why we need this and second about what's proposed, maybe bring in some developers to talk about whether they would or wouldn't, how they would respond to this. Whatever, wherever the conversation takes us. And then in February and March, obviously you're going to be doing what you do to prepare for town meeting, with town meeting opening on April 27th. That is what we have. I think the last slide just is your questions. Look forward to your feedback of how we should proceed.</blockquote>

Way back at the beginning of your presentation, you're saying, I would say 24 to 32 unit. Size building is the minimum for it to get state and federal funding for, okay? With that, say 24 to 32 size building, what size footprint do you need? Have you guys figured that out yet? Did a little quick layout? You must have an architect on your board there, right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, may I? The person on the working group who did the most work on that I think is Steve, who got the closest to looking at particular lots and what the building, how the building would lay out there. Yeah, and it came out to be 20,000 feet, which is probably comfortable. 15 could work occasionally, but it would be tight. And the approach, this was less of an architect's model, but more taking, borrowing the approach from EOHLC's compliance model for MBTA communities where you basically are looking at parcel dimensions, you figure out a floor plate, and you go up some number of stories with some assumptions of dwelling size. So roughly about 20,000 square foot property lot, properties with a four to six story building with a 0.5 car count. Yes.</blockquote>

I think it's closer to 30, maybe 40. No, I think the number is quite a bit larger than that. Yeah. All right, I just want to get an understanding of that because it's not these five, 10,000 square foot pieces of property all over the place, that just won't happen, okay? So it's going to have to happen in some of the major corridors, it's going to happen in parcels that are 25, maybe 30,000 square feet. I don't see that many of them, but they are, okay? There's more than you might imagine. True, but at least we can understand where they are, what it is, and what kind of neighborhoods we're going to form based off of this change, because this is a pretty big change and that's where you're going to target your zoning toward. Yeah, we'll be able to show you a map that lays out those parcels by residential versus business districts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be very important for us to understand and I think that will be a lot of questions asked from the town saying, well, and let's get it all documented so there's no confusion and the mayors don't say, hey, I'd rather put right information out there than have misleading information out there. You're also aware that we are taking some of our areas that have been zoned R1, like cemeteries, playgrounds, and rezoning those, okay? Potentially, but I don't think that's- Yes, we're looking at that, okay? I want you guys to weigh in on that, okay? Because that's going to affect a lot of things, because that's going to affect your percentage of affordable units versus market rate units, because what do you count a cemetery that's R1? Is that affordable or is it market rate? You know, I mean, you have only so many affordable units and now if you get this whole cemetery, which I'm just using that for an example, okay? I'm not saying- Yeah. Does that change your percentage and it changes where you go for it? I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. If I understand the question you're asking, you're asking whether like the 10% of all of our units, are there changes when you rezone those parcels? No. 10% is- 10% is hard to achieve, okay? But there's a clause, I believe in 40B, called what, safe harbor? Oh. It's the land max. Land area max, the land area max. Okay. Yeah. I'm more addressing that. Yeah. Okay? Yeah, I understand that. Okay, and we should look in that. I don't want to be hit by cyber. I'm not trying to- Yeah. I totally agree with you guys. Yeah. I think there's a point where we can say, hey, we should look at these things. Yeah. Now, then, much later, where you're gonna get- I totally agree, Kim. Okay. We, I'm happy to figure that out. I'm not trying to- I don't know specifically what you're proposing for rezoning, but we'll collaborate with your colleague and mine. I think there's a map that was just sent out, which we can shoot over to you, which is, again, I don't know whether this board will be supportive of that moving forward this year, the open space rezoning, but we can show you what the group from the Department of Planning and Community Development who's been looking at that is looking at for that. You guys have had a consultant in the department that has done the calculations of the land area maximum, and I'm probably gonna end up just going back to you, Claire, and saying you probably need to have those. That's a very technical question that you don't want my answer, because I'm sure it's very simple, but I don't know how to do it. No, but I think we should know about it, and we should talk about it, okay? I'm much better at talking about it here in this format at the beginning than in town hall. And I'm always hesitant to bring up the 10% and say where we are, because we have a crisis, and I know people want to respond to it. So wherever we are in the 10%, whether we're required or not to develop more affordable housing, I think the community has been unimaginable. We hear such a loud cry for affordable housing. I realize that's in the context of debates that are heated, and we're not putting this forward. Yes, but you know where I'm coming from, though. Where this could just, that real are you. And then, your majority of the funding that you're trying to get is from the state and federal. Which- And the federal dollars come through the state, so it really all comes from the state. Which I applaud you for. I wish I could take credit. But no, but I think that's a sound level, that's a very realistic approach, okay? Where instead of people saying, we need more affordable housing, and they just don't know where it comes from, I have a lot more encouragement when people say, well, we're gonna get it this way, and this way, and this way. As opposed to, we just need more of it, and that's all we need. I really am appreciative of that, and what you've done there, saying, you know. And the fact is that you're not trying to pressurize the private sector in doing all of it. Because they can't, and they won't. And so, I think that's all I have to say for now. Do you have any thoughts on parking? I support the parking. I had actually, at the MBTA, said, let's go down to zero. And, you know, I was a smaller voice then. But, you know, my voice will stay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, I respect any minimum, any reduction. Great, thank you. Tina. So, I really appreciate your work on this. This is very exciting. It's a very important initiative. I'm so glad to see it. I would, first, I would encourage you to step back from commercial requirements, requirements for commercial space. As you alluded to, as I'm sure you know, it is very difficult to finance. I generally think of commercial space as, cannot assume any revenue coming from commercial space. And it's just, it is just lost. It's a waste of money. If you're attempting to develop affordable housing, I think the option, having the option for commercial space in commercial districts is a great idea. And thinking about robust community space, perhaps making community space that a developer would want to put in their development anyway, available to the broader public, that would be an option I would be open to. But a requirement for commercial spaces is something that makes me pretty uncomfortable. One thing I wanted to ask you about is, is sort of interplay or difference in 40B. What makes, what would make this? more attractive to a developer than just going the 4DV route. Yeah, so I don't know if you have thoughts about that. The concept is that this is as a right, and I haven't included anything in the presentation, but we have talked about having some kind of design review-like public meetings so that there is some conversation with the community that we thought would be productive and yield a better result, but that this is not a potentially extensive process that 4DV can be. It can also be, I mean, it is designed to be a comprehensive permitting process that is meant to be faster than the other process that would typically be required. As we know, when it is not supported, it can be a very, very long, arduous, and costly, unattractive process for developers. So I think that is the predominant difference. It is the community saying, we are trying to build affordable housing here. We want you to come here and build it, and we are creating the pathway for you to be able to do it. But we have thought about what it means. We understand what we're asking you to do. We're ready for it. But we do want you to enter into a conversation with us. Does that make sense?</blockquote>

The parking you're proposing for residential is a half space per unit, but in the commercial business district, zero. Why the difference between residential, which might be one lot off Mass Ave or Broadway, but not for commercial?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 65</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the thinking there is that it's transit accessible if it's in those districts, and therefore, you know, easier to rely upon transit, sort of a transit-oriented development strategy. Although if you say, I've forgotten what the exact measurement is, if you say a quarter mile from any T stop, bus stop, it's going to expand quite a bit beyond simply the commercial district.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 740</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think the demarcation they're making between commercial and residential is not the right demarcation as far as that's concerned. On the other hand, unlike my colleague, Mr. Lau, until the town allows overnight street parking, I won't be able to agree to no parking requirements. I think maybe for affordable housing, half a space per unit might be workable, but I think zero just goes against it, especially for ones that are going to have some percentage of market rate housing. So I think that needs to be looked at again, or go to the select board and convince them that we can do a lot more with affordable housing if they allow overnight on the street parking. So I think they're the place to go. I'm not sure about whether it makes sense to have the overlay in the industrial district because we just have a couple of small industrial districts, and I'm not really sure that it makes sense to put them there as opposed to what we hope to do, which is to encourage more of that sort of development, and it's not a lot of space. On the other hand, I agree completely with Mr. Lau. We need to see which parcels they are because that may make a difference in how we think and how we think about this and what makes sense. If any of them are open space parcels, that would raise another issue. I think that the proposal we got from parts of DPCD on open space zoning is great, and other parts of it I couldn't possibly agree with for reasons we haven't had an opportunity to discuss yet. So I think those things will have to come together at some point. I'm also interested in where the parcels are to understand how much of the B districts will lose because my general impression is that a lot of the larger parcels are in the business districts. And so if we lose them, what are we losing? And how can we figure out what we're losing and gaining from those sorts of things? And do we rezone some other things' business at the same time to make it back? So I think we need, I think, more discussion about that to understand the cost. Yes, we all want more affordable housing. Yes, we all want more housing. But yes, we don't want to lose commercial development and commercial opportunities in town. And we don't want to lose open space. So how do we balance all of those things? And you've made a great case of the affordable housing. You haven't made any case of the balance. So I think that's going to be important. I'm just wondering whether we'll see what the parcels are, or just putting the overlay on all of the large parcels instead of the entire town, because that has the advantage of sort of not having this behind the curtain. This is really what's going to get developed, and this is what is not. But this is where we think these can be developed. So these are the places that we're going to put the overlay as compared to putting it over the entire town. I think it's worth thinking about doing that. I do think there needs to be some level of review. I think for comfort, we've just started thinking about how we're going to do site plan review for the MBTA communities, and it may be an appropriate review to use for these also, because it's a hazard-prone review, but it still allows a look at certain things that are important. So I think that would be helpful. And I'm not sure two public meetings is enough to get just the town meeting. The MBTA Communities Working Group did a lot of work over a lot of months, a lot of public meetings. You're compressing the schedule a lot, and I just don't know whether this will be more successful if you roll out a longer public process and bring it to 2025 town meeting rather than trying to just fit in two things and then go to town meeting. I think it will be a much heavier lift under your timeline. Yeah, my only sort of pushback on that would be it's two specific meetings that are solely for discussion of this, but then followed by all of your public meetings.</blockquote>

This work started pretty much as soon as we kind of put the dust settled on MBTA communities, and we aren't coming in cold to this conversation. We have been having this conversation about affordable housing, about the MBTA communities, about zoning, so it's a warmed-up audience, if you will. The other thing is in the flood zones in town. I think this either can't be in the flood zones or the overlay will have to allow them to build up above the free board from 100-year, I'd suggest more than 100-year storm event, I think a year in 2050, so that they can actually build in a flood zone, or else maybe there are no parcels in the flood zone, so you don't have to worry about it, but if there are parcels in the flood zone, I think you have to think about how to do that. I'm going to take that back to the group and find the right answer to that. I'm really hoping that the otherwise applicable regulatory requirement is kicking in, but I know you know what you're talking about.</blockquote>

We didn't really, you know, changing how, changing the, you know, what's the sort of open space-like things that parcels that are in R1 districts will change the 4DB land calculation. That was not part of our calculus, so it just never really entered the picture. With regard to the relationship between 4DB, it's really, I think we're envisioning an alternative. It's a different permitting pathway where, you know, Cambridge has an affordable housing overlay. They have a, you know, a process behind it. The first year it was in existence, they put something like, they put over 300 units in the development pipeline, so it was successful. But one of the things that, say, 4DB would give you that this wouldn't is the ability to negotiate and request waivers. So this, you know, it's the rules of the rules, and, you know, you aren't going to ask for, have the ability to ask for things to be waived. Regarding commercial, one of the interesting discussions we had was about, you know, if there is a commercial space requirement, is that eligible for HUD subsidies? The answer is generally no, unless it is a community service organization. Did I get the name right? I'm not sure. But basically there are some businesses that have a role in serving the community can be subsidized by this stuff. Otherwise, you know, the builders got to pay for that out of their own pocket. We were thinking commercial only, a commercial requirement only in business districts where commercial is allowed. But the one thing that we, I think, sort of settled on is, you know, wanting a definition that could include, you know, organizations that would be, commercial uses that would be eligible for a HUD subsidy. Community uses. Yeah. Community uses. Just to be clear. Community uses, not commercial uses. Right. That's what you're trying to say, right,</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve? That we wanted to leave room for community uses that could generate financing because they're included on a basis for low-income housing. So Arlington Eats is an example. It was one that we agreed would be an example of this, where it's a food pantry. It has what looks like a little grocery store on the bottom floor of 117 Broadway, but it is a kind of organization that would be, you know, it is a kind of use that would be eligible for HUD funding. Flood Zone, I agree that we shouldn't be building in there. What you said about Freeboard is something we should do anyway. Right, but we haven't. The Farnbight Place, in that development, all of the first four elevations were sort of based on the 2070 sea level rise storm surge 100-year event as Cambridge modeled, which, you know, they have elevations calculated right in that area, so it was convenient to use. And, yeah, and finally, regarding MBTA communities, one of the things that aside from a lot of outreach that, you know, came from that process, one of the things that I remember hearing was that, well, MBTA communities isn't an affordable housing proposal, and it's not, but this is sort of trying to be responsive to that desire for, you know, something that would create more income.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you, Steve. That's my list. Thank you. I'll just provide a couple more, and then perhaps we can just have a discussion around the board if it's helpful around a couple different things. So I, like Gene, also feel that I would not be able to support bringing parking down to zero until the town allows for overnight street parking, and you and I discussed that a little bit, and I think that that's something we've been talking about, wanting to put a joint ARB select board meeting together. I think that that's a really important topic for us to discuss with the select board so that they understand how impactful that is for some of the work that we are collectively trying to do as a town. So I can certainly continue to try and move that forward. With regard to commercial use on the first floor, I think that is incredibly important if we include parcels in our business district, specifically because we have such small business districts and we have such a need in the community for well-developed commercial space. So again, understanding where the parcels are, if we are able to exclude them primarily in the commercial, in the current business districts, that is one thing. But if there are, again, to Gene's question around, is this town-wide or is this an overlay for specific parcels? I think that's something that really could use some more study because I would definitely be in favor of either specifically and only a commercial use requirement for the first floor or a very tight definition of what community space could be. Because I do think that there are great community space opportunities, as long as they contribute to the activation of our pedestrian ways along those, specifically along Mass Ave and Broadway. I think there are two different objectives here, and they can just need to find the intersection of them, or really draft it for what the town wants and let the developer figure out if they can make that financial. We just need to make sure that we don't impose things that make developers not take advantage of our data. I understand. Right. And again, I think Gene mentioned the word balance or Shana, maybe that was you who mentioned balance. I think that balance piece is what's really important because again, I think we heard loud and clear from the business community. In addition, we fully understand and support the need for more affordable housing, but at the same time really need to support the business community in town as well. I also think that. We really need to understand what the proposed permitting process is to your point as well. Gene, I'm, I'm very uncomfortable with an as of right without specifically understanding what the review process would be. And I think that's especially what we just looked at before, understanding when, when, when things are developed with the mindset of being as economical as possible. Sometimes we end up with features on and configurations of the building that are less than desirable. And, and I think that it's in all of our interest to make sure that these spaces are just as, as well, well-built and fit in with the, with the context of the town, just, just as any other building in town. And I, you know, also just, you know, ask the question around, do we have the time to, to, to look at all of these things really comprehensively before spring town meeting? I know that even with the year that we spent on MBTA communities, we had a lot of pushback on, should this take more time? And we felt really strongly that we had a very well presented public process. And I, I just want to make sure that we have the time to look at questions like should this be, you know, for the entire town or should this be for specific parcels? And the question around commercial use on the first floor versus community use, the questions around parking. I just want to make sure we have the time and the right forums for that. There may be a pathway and I appreciate in one of your slides that you started to lay out what that is, but that that's a question that I have as well. It's fair. Couldn't possibly argue, but we figured we should start the conversation. And I really appreciate that as well. Absolutely. Great. Any other thoughts or questions from the board? If we don't get to see the main motion until just before it has to be filed town meeting, it's going to be subject to. What are we going to do with it if we don't like it, you know, so I think that timeline Doesn't really I think give us enough time to look at what you're going to present is the main motion, which is basically how you Alter the zoning bylaw if we only have a very short period of time To deal with it. I think we need at least a month. I think It's obviously a trade-off with public process. Right, right Plan to have it drafted while we're doing the public process. That's why we have pro bono counsel on board. I Hear you we will try to balance those objectives as best we can All right, can you add something else to say just I just want to reiterate Coming up that map Sooner than later. It's the most critical For us to get a real understanding of where you're thinking and what are the possibilities Everything else has been a little spit off of that. I think soon you get that to us Make them more comfortable we can with your time schedule I mean, I bring all the arguments are really great But until we get that map and see what you're actually really thinking of It's You know, it's not very hard to say. Yeah, you can do it this year or no Because we still don't know, you know, how big is it? How how encompassing this whole thing is? And we can certainly make time on any of our happy to come back meetings Whenever you know, you have something that you think would be worthwhile for us to meet together Okay, thank you so much really appreciate it</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, home occupations it is so if you would like to present this and then we'll provide feedback from the board and then we'll Go to the next one Okay, um very straightforwardly it's a accessory use at your house It's usually just you I took a look if you go to the library There are a bunch of old copies pulled was then called the Arlington directory Which is basically, you know Yellow pages and listed all the businesses and where the address was and who was the person who ran them? There's a lot of home-based businesses Some that are familiar since a lot of contractors who run their business from home also a lot of sort of General life needs that kind of lists here as dressmakers quite a long list My favorite a dandruff shampoo manufacturer at home We would see you at her house, which seems a little bit maybe suspicious But you know still there a bunch of miscellaneous home ventures and then things like professional services the position lawyers notaries, etc So this seems like there's a lot of at least historical precedent for having businesses And At least today we can work a lot more often. So you're sort of continuing that trend next, please so the thing that got me interested in this is that there's Arlington has a list of commercial vacancies and they publish the rent and If you are starting a business, it is very risky proposition Is your signing multi-year lease and paying on the order of thousands of dollars per month for business? You may not know You may not know if you get through that one so there's a lot of risk and you negotiate and This is a hurdle that not many people will want to clear The other problem that we have although maybe it's not that much of a problem So there's not a lot of commercial real estate and what is has to suit you in your business So if you can't find a space that works for you or the landlord doesn't negotiate or whatever You may not be able to find a match So what I'm thinking the opportunity here is is that if you're at a stage of the business where you're experimenting trying to figure it You can do some of it in your own home to figure out the nuts and bolts we can work and then you can start Looking for that next step up Um, I took a look at some other towns here this is Eight other nearby towns. I looked at it from a bunch of different dimensions Things like does the town allow? Employees that don't live in the building. How many square feet do you use for that? With the use what restrictions are there on use on any like externalities on neighbors things like that Can you sell things on the premises? Things like that and so what I looked at is there's some where a lot of towns have things in common like use restrictions or Externalities, but there's a lot more Arlington is sort of on the more restrictive side that I don't necessarily know need to stick around Excuse me on this example, this is whether you can have a sign so Much for their towns Manchester was the most surprising to me is that you can have one sign that's not illuminated And it's like some small amount of square footage A lot of these times allow you to have that Strange Next slide So I I tried to take a look at to say where are we today and Based on the other towns that are out there sort of like what is a more flexible version of this look like? And so I came up with this proposed before and after comparison and a bunch of these different dimensions very generally making these either more specific so for things like Externalities and neighbors this town is a little bit big or non-specific on some things and so this was Taking language of other towns and figure out how to use to be more specific in those restrictions and apply it Or in some cases, it's a lot of sign or allow you to sell things that you're making as part of your home is business Where we don't say? Allow you to have More than one people for music if you're at home and your music teacher allow you to have it off That's okay Actually, this is this is perfect. Actually Um, so science Be a two-square-foot non-eliminated sign which is what a bunch of other towns they all have that exact same provision Traffic is one of the ones where there's opportunity to be more specific. Lexington has a definition that says Deliveries have to look like residential deliveries. So things like a FedEx truck or an Amazon package or whatever. It is something It comes out of a Sprinter van And the limit on the number of customer trips are delivered per day that 10 is arbitrary It's basically just there to say this isn't gonna be something where cars are rotating through constantly It's meant to put some sort of specificity on it This is a thing we want to be aware of at least even if we don't know the exact right number The next is the most obvious We were all breaking the law for the last three years by working for home because the town says that professionals cannot work No architects who work from home. No lawyers who work from home. No, nothing. It's it's explicitly not allowed work from home use I think we can get rid of that because it's the least obnoxious job to anyone outside the house And then the last one that's Interesting is whether you can sell something you make so Ramanathan says no sale anywhere the premises a couple of the towns said you could sell things you just can't basically import thing Import you can't buy things and then resell them like a store would you're basically making something and then Making a table of your furniture maker and then you bring someone in to look at it and then sell it I think that's the kind of thing that That one and the traffic one are a little bit probably more on the edgy side, that's one more area I'm looking for very specific feedback on what you think about those two provisions I think that's the last slide, right? That's the last one great</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, so my name is Vincent and I wanted to just add a couple of thoughts to what James has presented as Professional who sometimes works from home and whether or not I'm putting myself at legal exposure by saying that I'm sure And especially thinking about the trend how a business is born or how how how a new business? Might begin in the town of Arlington. Obviously, we've had home occupations Probably before any other type of occupation The pandemic has affected that and probably increasing the number of people working from home It's sort of accelerated a shift that was already taking place But going beyond someone just simply working on their laptop from home How would a business start a lawyer an architect a contractor or somebody making cupcakes in their kitchen It's very difficult for someone to go from zero to 100 You know as an architect Can I go out and sign a three-year or five-year lease on a office space? My first client who seems like a risky thing to do. So So a more measured way to be able to do that would be to start working from home I can perhaps hire one employee and Once I've got some Revenue and my business is successful enough. I can go out and look for that office space I'll just add that And this is prior to the pandemic Approximately half of us businesses are home Based and so I think anything that we can do as a town to increase the flexibility and allow people to be starting businesses here in Arlington Thank you very much</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's start with Steve this time for any comments or thoughts. Yeah, I I Appreciate this and I Agree that we I think there is more room to be flexible in what we allow as a home occupation To just give a simple example My wife four years did finance and grants administration for one of the major research universities in the area She also does the same thing for a nonprofit It's volunteer work. It's volunteer on a volunteer basis, but it's still you know It's different grant agent different acronyms behind the granting agency, but You know, that's something that at least by my reading Occupation, you know, it's You can't be doing it and it's also the kind of thing where you know, this is this definitely doesn't contemplate working or telecommuting and It's also the kind of thing that's not it would be very difficult to enforce directly so I'm I'm in favor of a modernization Great thank you, Jean</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess I have a different Opinion of the zoning bylaw. I don't think it prohibits somebody from working at home Although I agree it could be rewritten to make it clearer than it is I don't think that's the intention. I don't think that I know that's not how I read So I used to teach planning and land-use law I used Arlington's zoning bylaw before it was rewritten as an example of how crazy figuring out accessory uses are and I put up a picture of My dentist's office Which was an old house, right? And I said look it says you can't do this How can my dentist have an office here? It's the dentist there, you know the receptionist There are two dental hygienists and about every other year One of the students got the answer, right? I bet it's in the business district and it is because what we've done with the business districts we've allowed people to Have occupations in the business districts to set up dental offices in the business districts to set up Doctor's offices in the business districts and all sorts of other things. So it's not as if we've completely Prohibited people from working out of homes. We've just said those homes have to be in the business districts in town I agree with Steve, it would be nice to update this a little bit. I Don't know about selling things out of the house For me that is not updating that's going backwards. Not that going backwards is wrong Necessarily, but I'm not sure that that makes a lot of sense. I don't know how you enforce the 10 cars per day You wouldn't and you couldn't and I always have trouble about Having a law that can't possibly be regulated or enforced in any way and And if you're very successful at selling you can have a Constant turnover of people coming into your place. So I'm not sure about that So I think it can be updated to make it clearer about People being able to work out of their homes Maybe you could have one other person who's not a resident work there. I think that makes sense I don't know about most of the other things</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks, Jean I'm in agreement with my colleagues that I think the code as written could use some updating I Gene I think I disagree about the Sort of strength of the business district. What if you don't live in the business district, right? That's great for your dentist. But what about my husband? So So I do think we need to somehow address that but the sentiment of home businesses that happen to be in the business District I think is is the right one And And I think And traffic was was my other concern I thought 10 cars certainly I was just arbitrary But I was thinking of things like home daycares here We're gonna have more than 10 car trips just to begin with so Home daycares are not a home business. It says the right in the definition Let's not go there and there you have it we went there a year or two so In any event, I think parking driving car car trip regulations would be challenging To pin down an appropriate number, let alone enforce</blockquote>

Thank you, Kim I would Until last minute you just wrote down What the limitations are yes or no, but I think you got to really focus on the business and Say is the business allowed or not allowed as part of this chart you create here No the use allowance not restriction if you want to say home businesses are allowed if they're not this I mean if someone wants to be a mechanic and he turns his One car garage Into an auto body shop that does repairs on cars and he's works by himself Cars driving out one car at a time Now, but he's working on It's a auto body shop in a residential area. Do you want that or not? But is that that's not a you So let's own business Maybe we're getting hung up on the language So the town does restrict things by the type of use so like if you can't have like Personnel care stuff like barbershops or salons. So the town already says none of them and that's gonna be included in this That's that's already in there. I don't know if does this overwrite that that's no Oh, no, no. So see that's the problem. I don't know right now. Okay, so let's let's say somebody else wants to You know, I mean the business you mentioned are fine, you know architect engineer or someone does Economic stuff. Okay, which is great. Well, but not everybody's gonna be doing that Yeah, say someone wants to also becomes a sign companies. He doesn't sign things by himself You know just big signs out of the garage Home startup, you know, you might just have a CNC cutter and cuts up the letters and do whatever they do Okay, I mean do you want that sort of laying around your your neighbor's house and that kind of stuff? I don't know. I mean, I think we should If there is limitations, let's include that.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 409</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene? So my understanding is these are exceptions. And you can find them in the zoning bylaws, so there's no question about it. Because they existed a long time ago. And when the zoning bylaw was written, it was like, what are we going to do with these? And it basically says, if the deeds were prior to August 28, 1975, you can do this. Now, if you get rid of that and put this as an allowed use in the bylaw, it would allow somebody to buy a 6,000 square foot lot, house on it or not, get rid of the house if it is, split the lot into 3,000, and put these side-by-side houses on it. So this is not simply to get rid of an exception for these houses. This is no need to do that if that's what all it's for. It's very clear in the bylaw that there are exceptions and why. It's to allow in the R2 and upper zones, instead of 6,000 square feet in one house, it's to allow 3,000 square feet and two houses that are connected by a common wall. Is that your intention? You could do it. I don't know if anyone will actually do it. But was that your intention? No, it wasn't my intention. Then we don't need it, then. Because that's the only reason to do it, to allow that type of building to start being constructed. It's possible that someone could do it. I don't know if they would. Well, do you mean it's not your intention personally? No, personally, that's not my intention. It seems like the Warren article, not to speak for you, but it seems like the Warren article is trying to make that something that's possible to happen. Well, that's my question. If this would make it possible town-wide, it would be a major change throughout all the residential districts, right? Because instead of whatever size lot you have now, you could split it in half and put these two houses on. I'm just pointing that out. Is that different than a duplex without the property line down the center? Sure it is. From the street, it should look the same, right? You get 6,000 square feet, et cetera. It's not so much a change in density, it's just a change in the type of ownership structure that would be allowed. Sure. Yeah. That seems fine to me. Yeah. Right.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 316</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve? So I happen to, I'll disclosure, I happen to live in one of these. I own one. I actually like it. It's worked out well as an ownership model. In terms of there are some things that span both dwellings, like replacing the roof, but I'm fortunate enough that the person on the other half of the duplex with the adjoining single family attached home has been amenable to that. From the street, Sunnyside Avenue where I live, has a whole row of these with the exception of one building, which was actually recombined to be a two-family, or to be a duplex on a 6,000 square foot lot. Now, one of the things that's sort of interesting is, one of the things that's interesting if you look at land value, the 3,000, so we have one property on the street where it's a 6,000 square foot lot. We have a lot of others where there are 3,000 square foot lots. The two threes assess out at a much higher value than the single six. Believe it, I don't know why. I talked to the assessor and he had mentioned that they assess smaller lots at a higher value per square foot. Something about a fair valuation, which I don't understand, but sure. So then maybe a reason to do this is that there's a potential for higher property valuations in town, which means more tax base if you do this. But yeah, in terms of, I mean, I don't see this resulting in different types of buildings being built, but given a duplex and what would a single family attached on, a duplex on six versus a pair of single family attached on a pair of threes. I think the buildings would look the same, but it is a different ownership model. That's really the main difference. I don't have anything else to add.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like there is, before I do, it looks like there is some additional reference material for the open space rezoning. There is. The board had asked David Morgan, who is the environmental planner, for a map of open spaces that he, when he came and gave his presentation before the holiday, to discuss the potential for rezoning open spaces in town that are currently zoned residential and go into a comprehensive rezoning of parcels that are not zoned open space, but that are functionally open space. So this board asked him to please come back with a map and a list of the parcels under consideration, and he was happy to provide that.</blockquote>

One of the things that I said when this came up, I'll say it again, is some of these, I think, might be appropriate to be open space, but some, like cemeteries, we should think about having a cemetery zoning instead, and some of them that are town properties but aren't really open space might be a new type of zoning called public space zoning.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic. So I'll do my thing and you can chime in. So on the definition of attached and detached in the zoning by-law, we came to agreement about changing the definition of attached and changing the definition of detached, and I've done a draft. This is only a draft, which I shared with the folks who were at the meeting. Do you want to say anything more about that? I mean, from the meeting perspective, by the way, it was a very productive meeting. I think we had a lot of good sit-down with Dirk Champa and Pat Hamlin, Jane and myself. As far as the attached and detached, the basic premise is that the terms sound like they ought to be in opposition, but they're not because there's a gap in the way that they're defined. We worked out a change in the language, which Jane has drafted here. Essentially what it does is the current definition of attached is it's attached if it has a wall in common, and it's detached if there's nothing in connection. So we're modifying it so that it's either a wall or a roof in combination would make it attached, and that if it does not meet that, then it is detached so that there is a clear delineation between the two. I'm sorry, a wall and a roof in combination, not an either-or? No, either-or. Either-or. Okay. A wall, a roof, or a wall and roof. Got it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, absolutely. We've had lots of questions about this. If they come into contact with each other, you know, basically the genesis of this was the question about the house and the garage. If you build a covered breezeway between the two, are they attached? Correct. By the current definition, they're not. Okay. The building department does consider that attached. I know that. So we wanted to make sure that we were capturing that. But if you have your garage and your house and you have sort of a wall that runs between them and it just contacts just the thickness of the wall, that would still be considered attached. Are we going to put a number on this? What I'm thinking of is all of a sudden I have a house, a garage, and I just put a little covered breezeway between. Yep. All right? And it's only maybe four foot wide, okay? Mm-hmm. And now it's considered attached. Yes. Going to the building department. Yep. Okay? Do you guys think it's called attached or detached based on your revisions there? By the proposed definition, that would absolutely be attached. Okay. So all you need is any attachment, any attachment. As long as it's a wall or a roof. Because the other question was if you had a deck that spans between the two, would the deck cause them to be attached? And we sort of haggled back and forth on that and decided in the end that that was not sufficient enough to justify considering it was attached. Let's say you have a house. Yep. Let's say you have a garage and the corners touch. Mm-hmm. Is that attached? That's attached. Because a foot of it attaches because they just. . . It's attached today. It'll be attached tomorrow. Okay. I just want to. . . Yeah, absolutely. So any attachment. So it's not based on square footage. It's not based on percentage of attachment. It's just any attachment. So if there's an existing roof across it, two feet wide, three feet wide, that you can walk under. Yep. It's attached. If the corners of the building are touching, it's attached. It's attached. Okay. So as long as we go to that, we're all clear. Okay. So Section 5.3.10, according to. . . This is the one about vacant lot, non-vacant lot. According to Mike Champer, the way it's been interpreted is if the building is removed and the foundation is removed, it becomes a vacant lot. And at that point, you can take advantage, if you want, of the different setback, the average on the street. And after lots of discussion, we felt like if that's the interpretation, that's fine. We don't need to change the zoning law. Okay. So that one comes out, yeah. So that one comes out. Okay. Then. . . The bullets to numbers. Yeah, we'll do the bullets to numbers. And as long as we did the bullets to numbers on the copy I gave you, Claire, there's another provision in there that can be deleted because it was just there for the first year the bylaw was in effect. Okay. And that's more than that. So change the bullets to numbers. And then we will just put a little reference in 5.4.2a to reference the other exception. Although technically it's not needed because if you look at 5.9.2b, it says notwithstanding anything else, this is how it works. So it's sort of a belt and suspenders to just add that. So we ended up with just the redefinitions of building attached and building detached. We ended up just adding the other exception in 5.4.2a, and we ended up changing the bullets to letters and getting rid of the one section that's no longer needed because it was only for the first year the bylaw was in effect. And by the way, if you look through the bylaw like I did, you'll find there's no standard method to go from. Big A to 1 to small a. So I just chose the most nearby ones and used the same way to do it. And I'll send that around to everyone. I just got it done today. Great. And then we had said that, again, all of the residential parking requirements in terms of that, that would be in 2025. I'm going to move that to my 2025 section now. All right. And that's it. Perfect. Great. Thank you so much, Christian. Really appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Gene, for meeting with them too. All right. We're good?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery and Various - 26</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    * 9:30 pm The Board will discuss their timeline for hearings on Warrant Articles to be presented to Annual Town Meeting. </blockquote>

Okay, so our next steps, which is our next agenda item, right, is the schedule of moving forward towards, first of all, the submission. I think we'll need to, at our next meeting, just review the language that will be submitted for the warrant articles. Correct. And we should identify if there are one or two members of the board. And like we did for the fall town meeting, Gene and I can certainly raise our hands to support, you know, if you wanted to do the initial draft or if you want us to do it. I did the draft. Gene has already done it. My one, the reduced height buffer, do we have draft language related to that? Gene, you had suggested separate language. I have to look and see. Okay. Because we figured out which section we needed to update it. It was incorrect before. But we didn't update it. So I'll look and see what I have. Thank you. I don't remember. I may not vote for it, but I can find it. Come on, Gene. Oh, Gene. Fabulous. All right. So just quickly, the spring 24 town meeting, not 25. So on the 22nd, we will review our final warrant articles, at least the ARB intends to forward. We can finalize the language for the 26th when the warrant closes. The earliest we can start our public hearings for town meeting is on the 4th of March because of our legal notification request. We also have a meeting on March 18th that we could potentially extend to, but it seems to me like we are only really looking at about seven amendments, including citizen petition that may be brought forward if the three that we heard tonight are eventually progressed. Okay. I mean, there may be other things that are on our radar, too. So I think perhaps if we plan for this, it might not be a bad idea to identify a backup addition. night just in case we need it and then we'll also need a night to for the vote right and a night to review and approve the report so our April meetings right our April meetings I know those moved a bit so we had April 1st and the 8th so I don't know the date that they need to receive the report by that's probably something that Julie and Greg have identified or maybe perhaps not yet but that's something that I think you know in the past we've had to add you know a quick Wednesday or something like that just to review that so I think if we can work that out a little bit further in terms of this this is a great start but I think we may need to just work it out a little bit further to get through all of the required. So at our meeting on the 22nd I will propose a schedule like potentially like you've seen in the years past. Yeah with an optional depending on again how many cities and petitions we have. Fantastic. Thank you so much. Perfect. And then the meeting starts at the 29th? Is that in February? April. Town meeting. Okay. I think that's Passover. I thought what the town moderator had said is that the Bible requires that it start on that date. But it's Passover. But it's a holiday so he may just open the meeting and then adjourn the meeting and have it officially start two days later. On the 24th. Right at least that's the current thinking. Okay great. Thank You Jean for your memory. I knew we'd gotten an email about it I couldn't remember what it was. Okay so that closes agenda item number five unless there are any other discussion points around the warrant article hearing. Jean. This is another hearing we're gonna have to fit in. Yes. If if we get approved by EO and HLC. Yes. We'll need to have a hearing I'd say to amend our rules and regulations for site plan review. And I also sent you Rachel and you Claire a draft on the change for when there's administrative review of signs. So I think we can probably do those both. But that does require a public hearing that will want to fit in somewhere. And the other news is I finished my first draft of what the site plan review could look like. So I'll give you a copy afterward. But it's so different than what you did that I think we're gonna have to sit down and reconcile the two. All right. Looking forward to that. Yeah. Great. Are you sending that only to Claire or are you sending it to us as well? Well I want to send it to Claire and have she and I sit down first and go over. Go over the changes and why I did some things and why I sort of put some things in that she had but put them in a different place. And when she and I I think have a meeting of the minds then I think we'll send it out to everyone. Perfectly fine with that. Great. Anything else on the Warren article process or other hearings?

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you. At the board's request I put together a rough timeline for outreach and adoption of the Arlington Heights Business District. The thinking of this board and DPCD is that we do need to re-engage with the public prior to bringing this to town meeting. And you know for lack of a fall date this pushes us out to 2025. I'm okay with that. I think that we do have you know it is it is a quite a bit of time to re-engage with the public but we already have at least a few dates on the calendar including next week at my ACMI update that I do about once a month. It will include an explanation of the outreach process in this memo that I sent to the board in the timeline as well as a review of the recommendations in the Arlington Heights neighborhood action plan which do include consolidation of the business districts into one neighborhood business district as well as a few others. I think it's a great idea it's another good reason for us to push this off the 2025 is we don't know if there may be other Warren articles or other decisions that need to be made around this you know prior to us you know just bringing forward the business district there could be access you know ancillary or accessory you know articles or things that come up that we may want to also progress at the same time. So beginning on January 15th I will be doing my community meeting media update. I am meeting with the Arlington Heights Business Association on January 18th to let them know that we are re-engaging in this process and to review where we were in 2019 and see what changes have happened since then or if there are other updates that people are looking for would like to see. I have tentatively scheduled a community meeting from May 9th basically to solicit the same feedback. We will continue to update inform neighborhood stakeholders moving forward including any contemplation of changes or updates you know folks should probably know if we are considering anything different and then in early September when the board comes back into its regular schedule we will do a report back with our with the outcome of our reach and then to finalize that Warren article or any others that may come out of that process to submit to town meeting this time next year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I make a couple of requests to add to the schedule? Yes. First of all thank you so much for putting this together I think this is a really great framework for us to use for something that I think it's really important for us to take the time to do in terms of all of the community engagement given how long ago the Arlington Heights neighborhood action plan was put together there's great information in there but I think re-engaging the neighborhood is really important. That's pre-COVID right? It was 2019. So a couple of other interest groups that I think I'd love to include as part of this process the Chamber of Commerce was very very interested in this and learning more and hopefully engaging so that they could make sure that this you know that they could be supportive of the the enhancements to future business growth in Arlington Heights. The Arlington Heights Community Association that Janet O'Riordan is so involved in I think they have tremendous community events they've just grown and grown and grown in terms of the number of residents that they get out for them they have a spring event every year I think it would be great if we could do a table at that event it would be great since that's really right around where we're going to be even a precursor to kicking off if we think we could be ready to again introduce that to the community ahead of the working community meeting more just interest and advocacy and then they did a fall event as well so that would be great in I think it was in October this past year to be able to you know come back to the community after all of this engagement activity in terms of this is what we heard this is what we move forward let's talk about questions concerns etc so I think bookending that with again the great community work that's already happening I know I appreciate that those are excellent opportunities and the other thank you the other question I have is whether reengaging the Arlington Heights neighborhood action plan implementation committee the longest game for a committee ever created in the town of Arlington would would be a good idea those were really engaged citizens within the town and it would be great to reach out to all those folks and we were gonna talk to the MBTA about that turnaround for the bus but let's re-engage them I want to reach out to them in a different way yes yes but you know I'm saying that route is is a much better route to go I think and then it's two things ones that turn around and then the bike path is MBTA property but they make it so hard to make it inclusive of the town if they can free up like a zone or area we can we can work together create a real entrance into Arlington from well any interaction to the bike path and the town I mean it's just like a highway right there and you know the only way you get off is on the street there's no oh yeah but those are that's Tony great I wouldn't mind adding to the topic somewhere maybe isn't there a Greek festivals there that happens in the spring can we get a table there and just because I know that everybody goes is just for the beer and there's a lot of people that go there from the neighborhood a wonderful community yeah I mean I love going there and if we have a table there for some stuff showing and it's my people's opinions every great Gina I think that I think the bike path and MBTA connections are great yes I agree with all the suggestions I have a suggestion separately about how to engage with the team and on this schedule I think it would be helpful if there's one date between September 9 2024 in January 2025 where the redevelopment borders reviewing drafts okay because this is sort of like September great report back but then the next thing is the thing is finalized in January I think we need a December check-in where we can see a draft I guess that also to your point around seeing a draft makes a question is this something that you envision the DPC D taking the lead on do we need to put together a subcommittee of the three development board should this go back to the Arlington Heights neighborhood action plan implementation committee I mean there there are a number of ways there's work that needs to be done yeah and the question is what is the body that will dive into that work I think at this point it's DPC D I would have to get up and re-engage with the public to see which level of interest if I can get the implementation committee back together and they're excited to be a part of that group and they were really engaged at the time okay that they were meeting</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silk Street and so relative to the additional timeline and the mobilization that's going to be happening in terms of a public outreach process I was curious for the board what would be the pros and cons of folding other business districts such as capital square into the same process in the same timeline great question so we have as a board discussed whether or not we wanted to look at this as something that we engaged in each of the business districts at the same time or sequentially and so what the board had identified certainly engaged with those groups to keep them abreast of what's happening but the thought was to each of the business districts have such unique challenges and opportunities was to address them one at a time so the thought was to start with Arlington Heights then move into to East Arlington following the work that's that's been done in the Heights but absolutely I think it's a great suggestion to you know let the capital square and East Arlington business community know what is going on as we work through this this process with the Heights because that would be the next group that we'd move into for the following year That's really less of a suggestion and more of a question as to whether there would be some advantages or some things that could be starting to happen at the same time even if they're not on the exact same timeline.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other thoughts? Okay. Yes. Should I stay here or move up? Why don't you move up? I heard that the microphone picks up better in the first couple of rows. Thank you. Thank you very much. Susan Stamps, 39 Grafton Street, 4 Green Streets, Arlington. And I'm following up on, I was here, your mid-December meeting with a proposal for changing the zoning on trees and parking lots and landscaping in parking lots. Since then we've been working with Gene Benson on scaling back our proposal. Our proposal was to have all parking lots constructed or reconstructed contain 50% shade, mostly from trees, but solar panels would be okay. And there was an objection, certainly in terms of the size, that that would really hinder construction of multifamily buildings and so on to have to make the parking lots bigger to accommodate the tree canopy cover. And so, in consulting with Gene, we changed it to, it would be a amendment to section 6.11.1, excuse me, 6.11.1. 6.11.1. There is no 6.11.1, but there is 6.11.1. We prepared after sitting here for three hours, but anyway. Imagine how we're feeling. My apologies, 6.1.11, and I think that is section D6. Yes, that's what it is. And that talks about parking spaces providing, excuse me, parking areas providing more than 25 spaces, shall include landscaped areas and at least 8% of the total paid portion of the parking area. Our proposal would change that to 50%. And it would be trees, but it could be solar panels or, you know, before the trees are big enough, it could be a 50% shade. They could be shade structures. So, that would be our proposals. That would take We can have most of the larger parking areas in town, and it would leave alone the smaller parking areas that are attached to residential buildings. So, we do feel that we are in a climate emergency. We need to be taking all the steps we can to mitigate the effects of climate change. and certainly heat in an urban area like ours is huge. It's only going to get worse, and if there's any measures we can take to protect our residents from extreme heat, which you have in parking lots that are unprotected from the sun, and then they get hotter and then they heat up the whole area, which causes heat-related illnesses, and of course it causes higher air conditioning costs, which then is more greenhouse gases, and there's a lot of other reasons. So, and we certainly have taken a lot of other steps in town to mitigate the effects of climate change. We just passed the specialized stretch code that requires extreme energy efficiency in multifamily housing, and now we, and electric wire in all residential through construction, and there are many others here that I know David Morgan could ask me to help me with if he were here, but anyway, this is consistent with where Arlington is going, being a leader on having rules that help with the effects of climate change. And the idea of, there was discussion, and so I would hope that you would help us develop this particular article and would end up supporting it, and I do feel it's right in the wheelhouse also of what we do ask developers to do on private property. We ask them to re-regulate the sizes of their sides, and the brightness of their lights, and how many parking spaces they should or could have, and their turning ratios, and we already require landscaping. So we already have a lot of rules. So I would hope that the board would consider this, and I just want to tell you that this is where we're going with this, with the 25 spaces, and we would like to continue to work with Gene on hopefully putting something together and we'll bring it back to you probably your next meeting.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 249</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's say there's an existing parking lot. I'll just pick an example. The Walgreens right on Mass Ave next to the gas station. That's a pretty big parking lot. It's a pretty big heat island. Now if I was the owner there and I said parts of the parking lot is starting to crumble and I need to patch it up, does this affect that then? Or if I'm just re-spriping and re-covering it with some because it's from regular maintenance? Or is it when I mill it down and repave it, then it counts? What's... You had it before. Did that change? Before you had it before, you had to mill it down to put new pavement on it? Yes. No, we weren't going to change anything except for the size of parking lots that it would apply to. So if they want to repair their parking lot, it would not affect the zoning change. It would not affect them. I don't think so. Just a repair. I think a complete repaving would be considered a reconstruction of the lot. I think that was... I just want you to be... when you state this, be clear about this. Sure. Part of maintenance is every so often you retarp the whole lot and then re-spripe it just because it's asphalt. The stuff just wears off. Well, I think these are really good questions. It's something we have to look at. I don't really know what reconstruction versus repaving...</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk a little bit about my latest lunchtime reading which is material related to Boston Squares and Streets Zoning Initiative. This is sort of their effort to their first step in trying to modernize their zoning code. There were two things that I came across that I thought were interesting and that we might want to consider at some point. Perhaps me more than maybe some of my colleagues have been torn by the words open space and the different ways we use those same words to mean different things in different parts of our bylaw. Boston's draft zoning has a little bit of a different verbiage for private outdoor space that's open to the sky but accessible to members of the public. They will call it public open space. But other portions of the parcel that are not accessible to the public, they refer to this as amenity space. This could be a backyard. This could be a balcony. This could be a rooftop. I just thought it was a nice framing. The other is with MBTA communities, we tried to come up with a list of active uses for ground floor. This sort of thing is very much at the center of what they seem to be trying to do and their use table has a whole section called active uses. Anyway, those are some of the dimensional regulations like they include things like floor plate size so you don't end up with too large of a building on a single parcel. Things like the length of unarticulated facades which we kind of do. We have some of that, yeah. It's a zoning bylaw. It's a zoning ordinance so it's dry reading but it's an interesting dry reading. Thank you, Steve. Anyone else?</blockquote>
