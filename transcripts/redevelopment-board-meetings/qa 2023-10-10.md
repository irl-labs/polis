> 1. The Arlington Redevelopment Board (ARB) added a paragraph to the discussion section of Article 12, MBTA Communities Overlay District, to clarify the differences between the Working Group's recommendations and the main motion before the town meeting. This included the reduction in height limits in the neighborhood multifamily district, the minimum parking requirements, and the map changes along Mass Ave East of Orvis Road.

2. The ARB added a paragraph to provide data on the capacity of the proposed district, the number of existing dwellings, the difference between existing conditions and model capacity, and the anticipated range of parcels that would be redeveloped over the next 10 years, leading to a net increase of new units.

3. The ARB modified the discussion section of Article 12 to include the reasons for adopting the changes to the Working Group's recommendations. This included the scale, density, and aesthetic of the existing neighborhoods, maintaining consistency across town in accordance with MAPC parking study conclusions, and allowing a process to rezone the East Arlington Business District in a holistic manner.

4. The ARB removed the phrase "allowing for development of multifamily housing in the R-0 and R-1 zones" from the third paragraph of the discussion section of Article 12, as it was not accurate.

5. The ARB added a paragraph to the discussion section of Article 12 to explain the context of the town and the benefits of placing the zones on and near Mass Ave and Broadway. This included supporting sustainable walkable neighborhoods, reducing the use of automobiles, providing more potential customers for businesses, and maintaining vibrant business corridors.

6. The ARB voted to disband the MBTA Communities Working Group at the conclusion of the Fall 2023 Special Town Meeting.
