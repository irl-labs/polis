So let's go ahead and move to our first item of business tonight, which is a public hearing for docket number 3789 62 to 64 Brooks Avenue. And I will turn it over first to Claire for any background on this on this hearing. Sure. So this is an application to install a stormer on a property that is adjacent to the Minuteman bikeway. This would be visible from the Minuteman bikeway. And so therefore, it was decided that the board should probably hear this application. The current use is for a two family is an existing nonconforming two family home. And the applicant seeks a special permit and hearing from the board to determine the appropriateness of the dormer, the addition of the dormer, as well as an exit onto the Minuteman bikeway in the site plan. Great. Thank you very much. And before we actually get to the hearing, I wanted to turn this over to Gene, because I understand you had a question for the for the board really about the this falls under EDR criteria and whether or not this is something that needs to come in front of the board or can be reviewed by the Department of Planning and the building department. So if I can turn it over to you first. Sure. So in thinking about whether this is subject to environmental design review, I took a look at section 3.4.2 of the zoning bylaw. I also spoke with Steve, because he had been on the zoning board of appeals and also had some experience with this. And it seems like this project does not require a special permit. So the only reason why it would require environmental design review under the criteria is if it alters a facade in a manner that affects the architectural integrity of the structure. So I spoke this morning with Mr. Champa, the head of inspectional services, to get an understanding about this. And I asked him, is this an unusual dormer in any way? Does it raise any issues in any way? Or is this sort of the standard run-of-the-mill dormers we tend to see added to family homes? And he just said it's pretty much a standard shed dormer, nothing particularly special or unusual about it. So I said, then what's the reason why it needs environmental design review? And his response was, well, we weren't sure, since it was on the bikeway, whether the redevelopment board should look at it or not. And I said, huh. He said, what do you think about that? I said, well, I think we got to have a discussion at the redevelopment board about that tonight. I also then spoke to Claire about it a little bit. And it seems that the question is, who gets to make the decision whether it alters the facade in a manner that affects the architectural integrity of the structure? Because the way the bylaw is written, it sort of says we only get to do an EDR review if it alters the facade and affects the architectural integrity. So one way to think about this is, we need to make a decision on each one of these that come before us. And if we decide that it doesn't affect the architectural integrity, then there's no EDR review. Then we just say it doesn't meet the criteria for EDR review. The alternative is to ask the planning director and the director of inspectional services to have a discussion about each one of these when they come. And if they can agree that it doesn't, then no need to come to us. But if they think that it does or it might affect it, then it would come to us. So I think maybe our initial conversation is, if this doesn't affect the architectural integrity or does it, and if it doesn't, what do we do with this? Do we just say it doesn't require EDR review and therefore the applicant can go ahead without? So the finding would be, for example, that it does not meet the criteria of EDR. Right. So that's where we are on that. Any thoughts on what Gene has just shared before we turn it over to the applicant? And I appreciate you bearing with us while we have this discussion. Thank you. I agree with the reasoning, but for tonight's particular case, I don't think we've received any information about the finish, color, kind of. We have a plan. We have construction drawings or design drawings, but not any sort of a rendering that would let us see what the facade will actually look like. So I think for tonight, I would at least like to have the opportunity to ask that question. Great. Thank you. Shana? I feel like if you walk up and down the street in this neighborhood, more houses than not have this sort of dormer and that it would not likely impact the architectural integrity. And so I would lean in the direction of, at least in this particular case, not needing EDR review. And the question of the question that Gene raised about process, I think, is a separate question. Great. Thank you. Ken, any thoughts? My feeling is, you know, we should invite our applicant to speak and then I think have a discussion around whether or not we feel it meets the criteria of EDR, unless you have any other... No, I wholeheartedly agree with Gene that I don't think this, looking at this and reading this, I don't think it justifies, I think it falls on our preview, purview, right? Yes. Okay. And this is a typical dormer that's added. I also agree with Gene about deciding does it go in front of us or not. I think if the building commissioner and client director says it doesn't, then it doesn't. I think they're the first line that can look at this and say, yeah, this is pretty typical, pretty normal. It doesn't. And if they feel like something's out there that they want, they can bring it to us. But not every single thing is brought to us like this. So as far as today's review, he's here. I just want to, you know, I don't think we need to have him say anything. If we have questions for him, we can, but I think he's all set as far as I'm concerned. Can I just... Gene, please go ahead. A couple things. So I walked the block today and there are a number of houses that are very similar. If you think about this, if the houses were on the other side of Brooks Avenue, it wouldn't be an issue at all. It just happens to be because it's on the Minuteman bikeway side that it becomes an issue. And I just, I didn't walk and look at every house, but I walked and looked at a few houses. There actually were no dormers on the houses on the next sides, but if you walk on the Minuteman bikeway, any length, you're going to see these shed dormers up and down the bikeway on the top of two family houses. So, you know, they're not something new. They're not something significantly different in any way. Yep. So if I could suggest in terms of where at least the majority of the discussion seems to be moving is whether or not at this time we feel like it would be appropriate for someone to make a motion of a finding that this docket 32 to 64 Brooks Ave does not meet the criteria of EDR and does not require a special permit. I'll second that. Okay. So let's go ahead and take a vote starting with Steve. Yes. Gene. Yes. Shana. Yes. Ken. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. So that would mean that you actually do not need a special permit or environmental design because the design review criteria do not apply in this particular case because the proposal does not alter the architectural integrity of the building. So I appreciate you coming in this evening and we will certainly, I think as a next step before we before we fully close the public hearing and the docket, what I would like to do is have a discussion among the board about procedure going forward and also see if you have any questions. No, only the question was because you've done many of these two families. Yes. So this was very unique because because on the management back when we were trying to do dormer, we're trying to do like the permitting process in time and then we're trying to blow the whole roof to raise the height. Then Mike Champa told me, oh no, if you do the whole roof then there's a bylaw which triggers the tree ordinance and I have to get the whole thing and like, oh really? What if I just do simple one-side dormer? He said, well, if you don't touch the roof and just do one-side dormer, then you're good. Right. I'll approve your permit. So I said, okay, let's just do it. And I told my architect to do that and then we went again like, oh sorry, now you got to go from like, what? What happened just now? Right. So then he said, oh because of the Minuteman, you're and so it was it was a process for us over here. Yeah, I understand that and I think that's what we our next step to do is to, you're correct in that the Minuteman bikeway location throws things into a space sometimes of needing to really understand whether a special permit is required to review the project under environmental design criteria. So I think that, again, that's what we'll talk about is a more streamlined process to make sure that it's going forward. He was about to issue us a permit and then he called back. So now, what is here? How this is going to take time? So what we would do and Claire, please feel free to jump in. You would work with Mike to let him know that the finding was that this review is not required and you should be able to send an email to Mike first thing in the morning to let him know what the findings were and you should be able to issue your building permit from that. Thank you. Thank you so much for your understanding. No problem. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. So before we close the public hearing in this docket, to Gene's point, I think we should talk, Claire, with you as well about a process so that we can be more streamlined going forward. And I think, Gene, you maybe perhaps if you could reiterate what your initial suggestion was and then, Claire, I'd love to see if you have any thoughts on how you think we could best work together with you and Inspector Champa and the board. Yeah, I guess I should say and the applicant pointed this out, the head of inspectional services makes a lot of decisions already about, you know, what fits within the zoning code, what doesn't, what needs a special permit, what may need a variance, etc. So I don't think it's a lot to add to his plate to say he and Claire, if Claire would want to be in this, interested in hearing from you on it, would make a decision about whether it met this criteria B for applicability or not. And then if it doesn't meet the criteria, Mike can do whatever he needs to do. But if it does meet the criteria, then the applicant has to come here. So I don't know what you think about that. I think that's fine. I think Mike generally has, because he sees every project that comes in even more than I do, he has a good idea of, you know, what's a regular shed dormer, what's a, you know, what's appropriate for the neighborhood, not that, you know, my office or myself couldn't go out there and take a look at, you know, the vernacular and what the situation is. I think where I was a little concerned is that that would ultimately turn into an administrative approval on my department's, you know, behalf, which I'm happy to issue. I think I have been a little hesitant to issue administrative approval in my tenure so far, but if that is, you know, what the board is looking at, so long as it's something very typical, something very typical in the neighborhood, I'm, you know, happy to work with Inspector Champa and issue that sort of approval. Kim? Yes, I think that would work out well. Okay, great. Thank you. Shana, any discussion? I said what I had to say. Great. Steve? So one thing I'd like to throw into the mix is our residential design guidelines for single and two-family homes, and I think proposed alterations that, you know, that are consistent with those guidelines do not need to come before us. Great. That is a wonderful suggestion. Yes, I appreciate that. Thank you, Steve. Great. Anything else? I will open it up to public comment, but seeing that nobody is here for that, I will close public comment and see if there is a motion to close this public hearing. Should we vote on what we just? We voted on the finding. Right, should we vote on what we'd like the process to be? Sure. So, Gene, would you like to craft a motion to that end? The motion should be when there's a project that raises the issue in 3.4.2b as to whether it alters the facade in a manner that affects the architectural integrity of the structure, the Director of Inspectional Services with the Planning Director will make an administrative decision as to whether it needs to come to the board taking into consideration the residential design guidelines. Is there a second to that motion? Can I ask one question? Please. The ordinance you specified, Gene, is solely for R1 and R2? No. It could be in any of the districts. But, you know what, Ken, for most of the other districts, they'll require a special permit, which will trigger another thing that requires EDR review. So, it's EDR review if it either requires a building permit and a special permit or it alters the facade of a building. So, when you get to things on Mass Ave or Broadway or, you know, mixed use, we get EDR review under the other part of the regulation of the bylaw. Okay, that's fine. I'm okay with that then. I just don't want to. We're not cutting ourselves out completely. Thank you. We could add just in for one and two family dwellings, or we could say in the R0, R1, and R2 zones, if you want to add that. Would you feel more comfortable? Yeah, but also can we add our um three families too? Yeah. Yes, I would feel more comfortable with that. In R0, R1, R2, and R3 only. So, do we want do we want to focus on districts or uses? That's another great question. Because you could say a single two and three family dwellings, which would apply regardless of district. Yeah, that makes more sense. Yes, that's a very good suggestion, Steve. Okay, so you're in agreement to amend your motion to include single, two, and three family dwellings? Single, two, duplex, and three family dwellings. And duplexes. I'll second that. All right, is there a vote starting with Steve? So, where did we work? There was mention of the Residential Design Guidelines in there. Yes. Can I suggest an amendment to that? Please. Things that, what's the language that we have now? Gene, could you restate? It was subject to review with the Residential Design Guidelines. So can we say, subject to review, subject to conformance with the residential design guidelines for single or two-family dwellings or other design guidelines that the town may adopt? Okay. I would accept that amendment. Could you? Let's go ahead and restate the motion, please, Gene. You don't really think I can restate it without this case, do you? I'll try. In instances where there's a question about whether something alters the facade in a manner that affects the architectural integrity of the structure to require EDR review under Section 3.4.2, the decision will be made jointly by the Head of Inspectional Services and the Planning Director and will not come to the Board, if they believe it does not, for single, two-family, duplex, and three-family dwellings that are in conformance with the residential design guidelines and other guidelines that may be adopted. Thank you. I'll second that. I will not make Gene restate that again. It won't be the same. I know. I know. Steve? Yes. Gene? Yes. Shana? Yes. Ken? Yes. And I'm a yes as well. Thank you all. We will move forward with that new process, and that will conclude our public hearing for docket number 3789.

<summary><a href="https://arlington.novusagenda.com/agendapublic/CoverSheet.aspx?ItemID=17801&MeetingID=2040"</a>2. Master Planning Process Update</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 2104</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * 8:15pm DPCD staff will present about the Master Planning Process.  Let's move to agenda item number two, which is the master planning process update, and I will turn it over to Claire. Great. Thank you. So on February 29th, Sarah and I held a webinar for interested parties in an Arlington master plan update, which would be an update to the master plan of 2015, and we're calling the process AMP up on the master plan update. So as part of that, I gave a presentation, which I won't go through in total tonight, that basically went over what is master planning, kind of recapped some of the work that's done and some of the achievements that have been met from the master plan of 2015, and then went through the update process, the planning process, including roles and responsibilities, status of where we are right now, timeline for this project, and then next steps. And so because this is a group that already sort of understands and is familiar with the master planning process, I won't go through some of these background slides, only to say characteristics of the master plan are that it's comprehensive, long term, it encompasses the entire community, focused primarily on physical development and assets, and then of course, the process, the first step is oversight, which is establishing a committee an advisory committee that can oversee the process and offer insight and advice on where we are and help direct many working groups or other bodies that the advisory committee thinks are appropriate and important. So I think we can also review what is a master plan in Massachusetts, it is governed by the planning board, it will be your role as a planning board that you will sort of oversee this process from an even broader view than a master plan advisory committee. There are seven study areas that I think that you are mostly familiar with, including land use and housing, which we've been working on a lot in the last year, clearly economic development, which is something I know this board is interested in, arts and culture, open space, public services, and then transportation. We will also need to include the statement on goals and policies, as well as an implementation plan for the master plan update. The planning process at a glance I went over, identification of issues, surveying, and by surveying I don't just mean surveys, but really polling and working with the community to see what is, where we are and what's needed, listing of goals and objectives, preparation of the plan, consider alternatives, adopt the plan, implement the plan, and then evaluate the plan. So we will go back to the 2015 master plan, clearly a community conversation, which is essentially where we are right now with the update process, this is from the 2015 master plan, we are here right at the beginning, and at the end, 2025, we are here. So we are at the place where we are scheduled to update the plan. Some of the achievements since 2015 is repopulation of the zoning by-law, adoption of residential design guidelines, and then the design guidelines for commercial and industrial sites, which we are kicking off, is underway in 2024. Some of the transportation goals and policies, we adopted a complete streets policy in 2016, and then of course the Connect Arlington Sustainable Transportation Plan of 2021 also came out of the goals from the 2015 master plan. Some other supporting documents that have been developed as a result of the plan, we already talked about the residential design guidelines, Arlington Heights Neighborhood Action Plan, which we are re-engaging on, and then the study, the economic analysis of industrial districts was informed by the Arlington Heights Neighborhood Action Plan. So one plan leads to the next, clearly since 2015. So, next steps for the master plan update. The ARB's responsibilities will be to appoint a new master plan update advisory committee, which we are calling the AMP-UP advisory committee. This is a group that we have solicited applications from, from our February 29th meeting. These applications are open through April 14th. For those who are interested in being on this advisory committee, we're looking to have 12 community members serve on the board. From there, staff will draft a request for proposals from planning consultants, and this scope will be a draft that is reviewed by the advisory committee. It will be task one of an advisory committee. For the advisory committee, this is a little different than how this has been done in other communities, where the staff has worked to develop an RFP, and then once the consultant is selected, an advisory committee generally is selected. Once the consultant is on board, we want to get the advisory committee on board prior to selecting a consultant so that we can have some community input on who that consultant may be. Once we have selected the planning consultant, we will kick off the project in earnest. Here's the timeline I put together that goes over some of this work that we intend to do in the next year or so, and then move into the AMP-UP project kickoff, likely November-ish of this year, once the consultant is on board. That's when we will update the master planning process more intensely. The AMP-UP advisory committee, we're hoping to find 12 community members who wish to serve, plus representatives from the redevelopment board, the select board, and the capital planning committee. This was roughly the same makeup of the advisory committee from 2015. We've pitched it as a two-year commitment with monthly meetings over Zoom, but we may meet more frequently throughout 2025 as the work progresses. The committee should be in place by May, and the first meeting is scheduled for the first week in June. That's roughly the presentation that was given at the end of February, as well as the process that we're looking to go through to get this project kicked off. Great. Thank you so much. It's very comprehensive, and I appreciate you sharing that. Thank you. Any questions or comments, starting with Shana? None at this time. Great. Jean? Just wondering how you think it's going in getting volunteers. We have 22, I think, 26 applications as of today. Fabulous. That's great. It's very exciting. As I said in the presentation, we're really hoping to get some folks who rent in Arlington on the community advisory board. That's something that's pretty important, I think, or something that I heard a lot in the MBTA communities process. It's like we'd like to start picking people up from some renters and people who want to be in Arlington long-term, but perhaps potentially not as property owners, as well as property owners, folks who have experience in planning, although that's not necessarily a prerequisite, and then, of course, the three representatives from this board, capital planning, and then the select board also to offer their expertise. And eventually, before this committee, I think, is really established, we will make a recommendation to the redevelopment board for membership, and the redevelopment board can go to establish the committee. This will likely be done at our second meeting in May, if not the first meeting in May, although that's starting to get a little full. And I think that's basically how we're going to move through the establishment of this committee. Great. Thanks. And then, you know, the 12 people in the capital planning and select board and us and renters, are there any sort of criteria you're looking for, you know, like people with planning experience, et cetera, et cetera? I think what we explained during the presentation is that it would be great for folks to have planning experience, but that's not necessarily anything that would keep someone from being selected to be on the board, or be on the committee. Exactly. Any other questions? No, I guess the board has to decide who's going to be the board. Who's the representative, yeah. Yeah, at some point. Yes. Yes. That's it. Great. Steve? Two questions. Did you say three members of the ARB? I said three members of town committees and boards, one from the ARB, one from capital planning, excuse me, one from FINCOM, one from the select board. Okay, so we'll draw straws at some point. Essentially, yes. And just out of curiosity, have you received many or any applicants, or any applications from applicants with transportation backgrounds? That's interesting. We have, yes. We have a couple from AMAC that have. Oh, excellent. Okay. Staff has been promoting this with their boards and committees as well, as well as the general public in terms of please apply and offer your expertise. Thank you. Ken? I'm just wondering right now, have we got approval for any funding from the town yet for the consultant? Thank you. So there is a Warren article for a $50,000 appropriation related to master planning. So that is a start. It's a bit of seed money. I have also had a bit of discussion with Mr. Feeney about outstanding ARPA dollars, which may be applied to master planning. We have at least done the homework on that. And we think that whatever the $50,000 appropriation doesn't cover, we will be able to achieve with ARPA funding. I just have to get the consultant in place before the end of the year. I don't think the $50,000 is enough. I agree. I think we spent close to what, $200,000? The original appropriation in 2015 was for $175,000, and I think they might have gone over. I have asked for $250,000 to do this project. And like I said, the appropriation of $50,000 is the initial funding. But we would be looking to use ARPA dollars, any remaining ARPA money, to supplement the rest. So we have about $200,000 ARPA funding for this? We have quite a bit of outstanding ARPA funds that need to be committed before the end of the year. That's all I have for now. I think having enough funding so we can get the resources and the studies to do this, it's going to be a long and drawn-out process that's going to involve a lot of people. I don't want to run out of funding so we stop doing these. That's all I have for now. Great. Thank you. And I'll just echo, I think, the question that Steve had. My question was whether or not there was anyone with any transportation experience who had applied so far because they think that that's something that's very important, obviously. I agree. Yeah. Okay, follow on. Please, go ahead. Have there been any landowners? Commercial landowners? Yes, commercial landowners that have said they're interested. There's a business owner, but we don't have a specific question that asks if you're the landowner. We have if you're a resident or you're a renter. I have to look at the application. We've been trying to actually not look at the applications very much. Review them all together. Yes, that's fair. Okay. Great. Good question. Anything else? I should have asked this before. What's the difference, as you say, between updating the master plan as opposed to starting a whole new process? That's a great question. I think what we will do is use the 2015 master plan as a place to start. We don't have to start all the way over from scratch. It will likely result in fewer visioning sessions and things like that. I think more detailed and specific work in those seven subject areas. We've talked in this board. I know we've had discussions about needing to flesh out or wanting to do more work in the economic development section. I also think open space could probably use some more attention. Basically, it's using the 2015 document as a starting place rather than just completely starting from scratch. What consultants are you considering at this point? I think there are several out there. RKG, I believe, did the master plan in 2015, but there are several firms out there right now that are doing master planning work, including MAPC, which I don't know. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to go with MAPC, but they are doing the work. I know UTIL, Justin Lowell's master plan. There are a lot of firms out there working on this subject matter. Any other questions? All right. Thank you so much for the update.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 1343</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * 8:45pm The Board will discuss their plan and timeline for outreach for the rezoning of the Arlington Heights Business District.  Let's move on to agenda item number three, the update for the timeline for the Arlington Heights Business District. Great. This is something that has been a little bit on the back burner as we've moved through the Trepican Town meeting and the master plan work kickoff. I did, in January, make a presentation to the Arlington Heights Business Association group about the idea that we would be progressing an Arlington Heights Business District, a comprehensive business district in Arlington. I was at their meeting in January and talked about this and tried to gauge interest from those who were there. Everybody seemed pretty excited about the idea. There were a number of people who were on the Arlington Heights Neighborhood Action Plan Committee who did agree to participate in this implementation project. So, sort of did a soft kickoff in January. I've re-engaged with the Arlington Heights Neighborhood Plan Committee, reached out to them both at this business meeting and then again over email, including today, to propose a meeting in May. On May 9th, the committee would get together to kick off this project, the implementation. I've also secured a table at the Arlington Heights Spring Fling on the 19th of May to start to bring this proposal to the public and talk a little bit more about what a comprehensive business zone means and what it will do for the area. We would move into another committee meeting maybe after this initial public engagement and then have a public meeting sometime in late June to go over the initial proposal for this comprehensive business district and bring it back to the public so that we can revisit the topic and gauge interest and honestly get some input and suggestions. The plan is five years old at this point. There are opportunities for engagement over the summer. I haven't quite identified, you know, I've known it for MBTA communities. We were at the farmer's market quite a bit. This is something we could do again over the summer a couple of times to let people know what's happening. Again, we would have this committee meet to work to draft the zoning. Gene, you asked for a time sort of certain about when this may come back to the ARB. I'm looking at your meeting on the 21st of October for that. And then after getting the ARB's input, you know, drafting this zoning with the committee, have a second public meeting where we sort of go over our findings and try to fine tune public input and any observation that we get at that point. Put the final zoning to the ARB right about when we usually start to discuss Warren articles in December. And then draft the Warren article hearing and bring it to town meeting next spring. So that's the timeline that, you know, I've looked at that we've established. And like I said, I reached out to the committee this afternoon to discuss that. to talk about the meeting on May 9th and see if that works for folks, and we should be getting this underway right after town meeting. Great, thank you. Kim, any questions? Comments? Do we have a consultant on board for this or do we need a consultant for this? We don't have a consultant on board for this. I'm not sure we need a consultant for this. We do have pretty prescriptive zoning written already in the Neighborhood Action Plan, and I think what we're looking for is public input and comment. I would, I think, you know, if when the zoning, as we're drafting the zoning, I will rely on the ARB, honestly, for input and also work with the town council on drafting the zoning for this. But, you know, interestingly, I think what we did at BTA Communities, we did not have a consultant other than town council to review, and this board, frankly, to review the zoning as it was drafted. We used mostly, like I said, resources that we had on hand. We don't, so no, we don't have a consultant for this. It's just more, really, honestly, this is about public outreach, plan being five years old, and, you know, just making sure that we have, that it's still, you know, where the community is, I think, to have progressed. The reason why I asked is, I think having diagrams and some models and sketch-up stuff would help portray our ideas better and get comment back from the public. I think just having, you know, verbiage is not good enough, and it'd be hard to misinterpret what is meant. So I would suggest maybe having some, setting aside some sort of funding where we hire somebody to do some models or some diagrams so that it'd be easier to be understood. Great, thank you, Ken. Anything else? No, not for now. I think this is good. Good luck. Great, thank you. Shana. Ken just touched on something I was gonna ask, which was, what kind of budget do you anticipate needing for this? With mailings, with whatever else, what sort of budget do you anticipate needing, and where do you think that's going to be coming from? That's a great question. I think, you know, it's, I do have some department funds that we could put towards this, as well as planning dollars that, you know, I regularly receive through CDBG, that's possible, that's applicable to this as well, and certainly I could ask, you know, see what's available through the town manager's office. I don't anticipate this being a big dollar project or that heavy a lift. You know, I'm thinking maybe $2,500, $5,000, something like that, which shouldn't be too, too hard to come up with. Okay, and how are you feeling about staff time with the master plan and the Arlington Heights Business District? That's a great question. I think I'm still working a lot with them. Clearly, I think, you know, we will need some, we'll need staff to be engaged on this. I think Marisa Lau, who's our senior planner, has some capacity to help me with this project. Okay. That's all I have. Great, thank you. Gene. Yeah, I think this looks good in lines with some of the things we've talked about before. Do we have an IRB member on this committee? We do. That's great. It's me. Oh, good. Okay, just wondered whether we did. Yeah, I think the only thing, and we've talked about this in some other contexts too, if we have an IRB member on the committee, we can ask the IRB member at any point during this time to sort of do a little presentation, or if you, Rachel, since it's gonna be you, feel at any point it would be helpful to have input from the board along the way. Absolutely. Yeah, so yeah, I think this is good. I sort of, you know, agree that I don't think this is like a heavy spending plan to get done. There are some changes, I think, in the heights since that plan was done five years ago, and when I was reading it a couple months ago, I was like, oh, those things happened, even without the plan. So I think there's a little bit of a need to think about that and sort of how to fit those pieces together in what will be 2025 and 2026, yeah. Great, thank you. Steve. Yeah, one question. Any word, or in terms of gauging interest, did you get any feedback or, I'm thinking about the owners of the significant industrial properties in the heights, like the gym site. Any feedback, was it positive? Very positive feedback from owners of larger industrial sites that I have spoken with. Okay, very good, thank you. Great, any other questions for Claire?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 175</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * 9:00pm The Board will discuss and comment on the proposed warrant article for Special Town Meeting.  All right, so let us close agenda item number three and move to agenda item number four, which is the special town meeting discussion. So I will turn this one over to Claire to discuss the proposed one article that will be submitted tomorrow, pending any potential changes from the board this evening. This is not a public hearing. This is purely to discuss the warrant article language for tomorrow. A full hearing will be held on April 28th. 29th. 29th, thank you very much. April 29th, and prior to that time, the final main motion may be altered. So at this point, we can certainly discuss the main motion, but the discussion this evening is primarily around the language of the, the warrant article language, which will be submitted during the, during the time that the warrant is, the special town meeting warrant is open tomorrow. So Claire, any clarifications?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Claire Ricker - 226</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. This warrant article is an extension of the, the conversation that I've had with this board about procedural flaw in warrant article 12 of the last fall town meeting. The AG's office working with town council has determined that the town meeting needs to, would, should revote on the map and the parcel list that are attached to the MBTA community zoning. And so town council has really taken the lead on this warrant article and on what is required from the attorney general's office. He drafted the warrant article as well as the draft amendment language. I believe in consultation with the attorney general's office to make sure that it is correct. And it is indeed exactly what the attorney general's office is looking for in a, in a revote of town meeting. We spoke about how quickly and what the board's involvement needs to be in progressing this warrant article. Again, this is not the public hearing this evening. It is really a discussion on article language and the draft amendment. If the board has any comments on that, the warrant will open and close tomorrow is what I believe. And, you know, we will be able to get any comments or thoughts to town council tomorrow before the warrant opens and closes and should be able to move forward from there.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 48</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the warrant language itself, actually no, all of my comments were related to the draft amendment motion. I'm okay with the warrant language. Okay, great. And we can come back to the draft, to the main motion language after we review the warrant article language.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 394</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene. So I called town council this afternoon and had a conversation with him about this. And so what I'm going to mention just in the warrant article language itself is based on that conversation with him. The first thing I'll point out is this says not inserted at the request of the redevelopment board, but inserted at the request of the department of planning and community development, the town manager, which is pretty unusual for a zoning article. And I had a conversation with town council about that and why that was. And he ended up thinking it would be better if it was the ARB warrant article rather than the department of planning community development and the town manager warrant article. And so that's for our consideration, but it seems to me that's the way zoning articles other than resident articles are presented and it would make more sense. So that's one. Number two, his use of the term in quotation mark MBTA communities, which was not used and is not in the text that town meeting adopted in October and he said he just got this from some other towns that did it and it was perfectly okay to leave out quote MBTA communities close quote from both the title of the article and then from the wording of the article itself where it says quote MBTA communities close quote. So I'd recommend leaving that out and also he got the words backwards. It's not multifamily overlay housing district, it's multifamily housing overlay and it's districts with plural because there are two when you look at what was adopted by town meeting in the text, it's districts. So we would need to change that wherever it says multifamily overlay housing to housing overlay and then districts. So there are a couple places where that would have to be fixed and since we're taking out MBTA communities, my suggestion in the sentence for the bylaw where it says to see if the town will vote to amend its zoning map and zoning bylaw, my amending section 6.1.2, it's 4.1.2, 4.2 of the zoning bylaw, I would add consistent with the MBTA communities law and then I'd say to add and then the rest with the changes I suggest. So that's what I would have for the article title and the article itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, however we usually do it, we're the ones who put in a warrant article. I forgot what the exact wording is, submitted by, filed by, whatever the exact wording is when we do it. Insert, I think it's inserted. Do we have to vote on that then? If it's our... Yeah, we do. Will we have time for that? Yes, that is what the hearing on April 29th is for. We will hold the hearing and vote. Typically we do them separately because we need multiple nights to do so, but there is no issue with us doing so in one evening.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 108</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. One item I would look at, and I did not have a chance to review this with town council. Let me just get back to this item here. Because I do wanna make sure that we're consistent with the way that the district was described in the Warren article from special town meeting 2023. The procedural item references that this map... I'm looking at the words as approved by the town special town meeting on October 25th, 2023. I want to make sure that the way that others are reading that is that that is relative to the zoning change and not to the map as approved.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 37</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I say something? Please. Yeah, I think you raised an important point because it's a problem in the wording below when we get to that also, because what's in this article is what they haven't approved.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Various - 608</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct. Yes. So without making the changes that you've suggested, I would suggest in alignment with the, and then restate the MBTA or excuse me, the so you would keep the first two sentences and then note as reviewed and in alignment with the approved multifamily housing. Overlay districts or in alignment with the multifamily housing overlay districts as approved by the town special town meeting on October 25th, 2023. So separate. Consistent with. Correct. Consistent with. Correct. Yeah, so after the semi-code would say consistent with. The multifamily housing overlay districts as approved by the town special town meeting on October 25th, 2023. Yeah. Or you could say, well, yeah. As consistent with the multifamily housing overlay districts. Yes. And there's a similar problem in the amendment. Down here. Oh, I know we haven't gotten to that yet. Yes. Yes. So this is largely for Mr. Benson, but would it be worth reference just making mention of chapter 48, section 3A? As opposed to consistent with the MBTA communities? Yeah. That would be. There's, I mean, if we can cite a chapter in first, I think it would make sense to do that. Yeah, I agree. Okay, so this would read, to see if the town will vote to amend its zoning map and zoning bylaw by amending section 4.1.2 and section 4.2 of the zoning bylaw to add the multifamily housing overlay districts. Multifamily housing overlay districts. Yes, I had that plural. Yep. Okay. Consistent with the multifamily housing overlay districts approved by the town's special town meeting on October 25th, 2023, or take any action related thereto. The only other thing would be after the phrase section 4.2 of the zoning bylaw, it could say consistent with Mass General Laws, chapter 48, what is it, section 48? Yes. And the, so. So it would be. here. I'm sorry, so can you tell me exactly? So you see where it says by amending section 4.1.2 and section 4.2 of the Zoning By-law and consistent with Mass General Law chapter 40A section 3A. In lieu of MBTA. Right, right. Just substituted. Which flows a little better. Right, yeah. And then it goes back to add the multi-family. Yeah, consistent with and then then it goes into again it's another consistent with. That's okay, that's after the semicolon. Correct, after the semicolon. Consistent with the, consistent with the multi-family housing overlay districts approved by the town's special town meeting on October 25th, 2023. May I, by a conjunction, after the first semicolon? Please, please. Oh, I was thinking just a semicolon and. Okay, and and consistent with these. Yes, okay. Do you have that? Shall I read it? Please. To see if the town will vote to amend its zoning map and its zoning by-law by amending section 4.1.2 and section 4.2 of the Zoning By-law consistent with Mass General Law 40A section 3A. Chapter 40A section. In lieu of chapter 40A section 3A to add the multi-family housing overlay districts as approved by a town's special town meeting on October 25th, 2023 and consistent with the multi-family housing overlay districts as approved by a town's special town meeting or take any action thereto. So there's an extra, your first as approved by the town's special town meeting should be struck. There's a semicolon after the citation of Mass General Law chapter and section and the first reference to multi-family housing overlay districts semicolon and consistent with the multi-family housing overlay districts approved by the town's special town meeting. And then it would say inserted at the request of the redevelopment board if that's what we would prefer.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 189</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other comments? Make sure I have the correct language there. Yes, it's inserted at the request of the redevelopment board. That's consistent with our other items. Great and then Claire will you review this updated language with Mike Cunningham tomorrow morning? Okay, great. Great. And if you wouldn't mind either you or Mike before it's submitted just sharing that out to me and perhaps to Jean via email before that's submitted. Thank you. Okay, there was also Jean the suggestion to the title which was amendment of zoning map. Just delete MBTA communities. Designating the multi-family housing overlay districts and amendment of the zoning bylaw. And then again in the article title itself you have to delete MBTA communities and make districts a plural. So it's a zoning bylaw amendment slash amendment of a zoning map designating the multi-family housing overlay districts and amendment of zoning bylaw. So basically in that title just crossing out MBTA communities the article title. Correct. And districts plural. All right any other discussion on the title? All right let's get to the draft amendment. Jean you want to kick us off again?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 149</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot of people had comments. My major comments were in the draft amendment deleting every time there's MBTA communities in quotes. Fixing the one, two, three, four, five places where the words overlay and housing are reversed and adding districts to them. And then we have we have the problem in here where I don't know exactly how we want to say this town meeting approved the text but there's you know the AG's office felt like we had to have town meeting approve the map again. Correct. That's really what it is and so I think a plainer way to say that part of it and then then down in accordance with this vote I think would be fine with again getting rid of MBTA communities and flipping the overlay housing and adding the districts. But I think Steve and Shana had some other issues.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak and Rachel Zsembery - 273</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay let's start with Steve. So the actually I just had one under the proposed change in 412 I was going to ask if we should name the two overlay districts but I think just making the new item enumerated item number three plural would be fine. Yeah they need to write number overlay and housing need to be reversed. Oh yeah. They're reversed on that one too. I forgot that one and adding districts at the end. I agree Steve. I think since it's mentioned multiple times that perhaps naming both of them and then you know in parentheses noting that in the future we'll just refer to them as the plural districts going forward would not be a bad idea. There's no harm in being as specific as possible. Where would you do that? So that the town doesn't hereby amend not amends its zoning map to designate the and then I would name the two districts and then in parentheses call them the multifamily housing overlay districts that were voted and approved by the town's 2023 special town meeting. So name the the business as well as the neighborhood multifamily districts. I would do it reverse I would because I see what you're saying it was yeah the multifamily housing overlay district is consisting of correct those two districts. That makes sense. Steve does that address your concern? Yes one other we say approved by the 2023 special town meeting. I believe we had special town meetings in the spring and fall. Correct. We can say fall special town meeting. Or just to indicate it's the fall. Yep. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gina? Rachel you spoke to my main concern so I'm going to leave that for you to raise again. You were more articulate about it then then I was going to be. That's about naming the two districts? That's right. Okay. That's right but Jean I'd also be interested in hearing you talk a little bit more about the issue you raised speaking in plainer language about what the what the true what the true problem is here. I think that might be useful. How how would you go about doing that?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson and Rachel Zsembery - 137</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think so I don't know I would have to sit down and try to write this out. In terms of like the getting getting back to the true nature of the problem that's I think that might be better material for the discussion in our report rather than the main motion. That makes sense. That's fair. Yeah but I agree this draft amendment could be a lot shorter. That's a result. It could just be amend section whatever and the zoning map to adopt those that are referenced in. This tries to this tries to split the baby. It tries to do an explanation but not a good explanation and maybe just cut it all together. We have a little more time with that right? That doesn't correct. That doesn't have to be right away.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery and Claire Ricker - 243</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct. Claire I think I need you to confirm the date that the main motion needs to be finalized prior. Well it we can review it and change it actually if it's our article up until that evening we can change that because we will be voting on the final text. Up until which? Up until the hearing date on April 29th. Okay. Up in it and through that evening we can make changes to the text of the main motion. So so for tomorrow we just need we just need the title and the motion and the Warren article language. Yeah. I just want to see if we can add somewhere that explains that the zoning map that we're amending put into this has not changed. It's the same zoning map that was that came with the text there. It was is it's just a clerical. Yeah I think when we do that we need to do this. But I want to say that it was not changed. It had not changed. So people don't say are you trying to slide something by or whatever. It has not. Correct. It's potentially also good material for the discussion. Section of a report. That's all. Right. Shana did you have something else? No. Okay. Any other discussion? Okay. Great. So we will work on ensuring that this is submitted tomorrow. Thank you.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move to item number six which is new business. And I will see first if Claire has any new business. Great. Thank you. Kim? No. Shana? No. Gene? Yes. Go for it. So what we just were discussing for MBTA communities made me go back and look at all of the warrant articles we put forth for the regular town meeting and I realized that when we proposed deleting the wet inland wetland district we didn't go into 4.1.2 and delete number two inland wetland district. So we have to figure out how to do that at town meeting if not before town meeting and I'm not sure if there's a way that we can put in an amendment to our warrant article at this point or at town meeting or if one of the town meeting members on this board will need to put in an amendment. Just because all we really need to do is the map change. That was to delete this line right here which we failed to do when we agreed you know when we voted to delete the inland wetland district. We didn't look back at 4.1. So I don't you know if there's a way to do that? I don't know if there's a way to do that before town meeting. So we can, Claire do you want me to talk to Mike Cunningham and Greg the moderator about that? What I would do is I would then pull that from the request to be included on the consent agenda the that particular warrant article I included that on the We'll get voted off the consent agenda. It is an administrative change so I can ask that that be pulled and then at the same time we can have a conversation with the two of them to determine how how best to address that. If we can't address it ahead of time, Steve or I can. I would offer to file an amendment. If it can't be done ahead of time. It's just cleaning up a little piece that we didn't do. And that's which letter in 4.1? 4.1.22. Thank you. We should have proposed deleting that along with everything else. Thank you. Sorry, Sheena? And is that, do we need to, do we need to delete it elsewhere? For example, maps? Great. No map exists in the inland wetland district. Yeah, it's a good question though, right? We so rarely make a map change like this. It's important to review that. There should have been a map. There should be a map of the floodplain. Anything else, Gene? No. Steve? I do have something. Yes. So over things I amuse myself with on lunch breaks, Kate, this week it was looking through the results of the 2023 Envision Arlington Town Survey. So there were 1,944 responses, which was a significant increase over last year. But two things I thought were sort of noteworthy. Three things I thought were sort of noteworthy. The largest group of respondents by tenure, how long they've lived in town, were people who've lived in Arlington 0-5 years. That was 23%. The next largest group was 11-20. And then 6-10 years. So between those three that's about 60% of the respondents. So we continue to turn people over at a fairly good clip. The report mentioned 79% answered that they own their own home rather than rent, which is a higher percentage than the census figures indicate. This could be just in terms of a difference in who answered is different than our census. Or it could be that things have changed that much since 2020. And finally, 32% of respondents reported having incomes over $200,000. That's the largest group. And it was up 3% from last year. Thank you for the summary. That is my summary. Much appreciated, Steve. And thank you for pouring through that in such detail. Steve, household incomes or personal incomes? I don't remember the way they asked it. I think there was a point in the past where one copy of the survey was mailed on paper to every household. And now I think they've sort of switched to individual. So I think it may, I am not 100% sure, but I think it may be individual. Great. Thank you very much. Any other new business?</blockquote>
