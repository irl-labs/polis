<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * 7:30pm The Board will review and vote to approve meeting minutes.  Good evening everyone. Welcome to the Town of Arlington Redevelopment Board. I'd like to call this meeting to order. My name is Rachel Zemberry. I'm the Chair of the Redevelopment Board and I'd like the other members to please introduce themselves. Steve Roblot, good evening. Eugene Benson. Shaina Corman, Houston. Ken Lau. Thank you. And we have from the Department of Planning and Community Development, Director Claire Ricker and Assistant Director Sarah Suarez joining us this evening. So without further ado, let's move to our first agenda item, which is a review of the meeting minutes. The meeting minutes that we have to review today are loading. I'll describe them in a minute, are from February 26, 2024 and we'll see if there are any additions or corrections from the Board, starting with Ken.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is one on page three. Near the bottom of the page it says Mr. Lau proposed on that paragraph. I just want to insert a word at the last sentence. It says accurately show the surrounding buildings. I want to add the word massing, accurately show the massing of the surrounding buildings. Earlier I was talking about details not required, just the massing.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 34</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      * 7:35pm The Board will hear the proposed zoning amendments. The public hearing will include time both for public comment and for deliberation and discussion by the Board.</blockquote>

All right. That closes agenda item number two and we will now reopen the public hearing for the Warren Articles for 2024 Annual Town Meeting. This is the second of our nights of hearings as published in the schedule. Consistent with the past, the ARB will be hearing from article proponents and public wishing to speak on each of the articles as scheduled. This evening we will be hearing articles 30 through 34. Applicants will have up to five minutes to address the board. The board will then pose any questions to the applicants followed by a period of open public comment. Note that the board will reserve final discussion and voting on each article until the last night of our hearings, which will not be this evening.

<summary>ARTICLE 30 ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT / SHADED PARKING LOTS</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 38</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see if the Town will vote to amend Section 6.1.11.D of the Zoning Bylaw to require that trees or other shade be provided in parking lots with more than 25 spaces; or take any action related thereto.</blockquote>

So with that, what I would like to do is move to article 30. You can give me one minute. I will open our document here. And for each of these articles, what I'd first like to do is turn it over to Director Claire Ricker to see if there are any items of introduction starting with article 30.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Claire Ricker - 34</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you. So we are moving into our five citizen petition articles this evening, beginning with article 30, which is shaded parking lots. This was proposed by Susan Stamps and 10 community members.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you very much. If you could sit right here, that would be fantastic. And again, we'll try and reserve the front seating for the applicants and people speaking so that they can be picked up by the microphone for ACMI. So what I'd like to do, if you could please introduce yourself, name, address, and please go ahead and introduce the article. If there are any slides you'd like us to show, please just let Claire know and we can advance them. Right. So you can advance for me. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Elizabeth Carr-Jones - 594</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. All right. I'm Elizabeth Carr-Jones. I live at 1 Lehigh Street here in Arlington, and I'm here representing Green Streets, Arlington. I'm here to present article 30, shaded parking lots, which would require that shade in the form of trees and or photovoltaic canopies be provided in Arlington's parking lots with more than 25 spaces. As the board knows, we originally championed this idea last year during the MBTA communities process. Oh, you already advanced it. Thank you. There, that one. Okay, thank you. As a community, we recognize the benefits of a more livable environment with green shady streets, great quality of life, and welcoming local businesses. We also recognize the importance of climate change resilience and seek out ways to reduce excess heat and flooding and improve our air quality. Arlington was designated one of the first green communities in Massachusetts way back in 2010. We've been weaving sustainability into the fabric of our community for a long time. Next slide, please. Now let me stress the urgency of now. Global temperatures are rising at an alarming rate, as illustrated in this graph from 1880 to 2020, and this ground level temperature map of Arlington from Mystic River Watershed Association's Wicked Hot Mystic project shows a pattern of higher temperatures in red in areas with more pavement and fewer trees and the lowest temperatures in our few areas of forest. Next slide, please. We're proposing that the town amend the zoning bylaw that pertains to parking lots of more than 25 spaces. This section currently requires landscape areas of at least eight percent of the park paved area that are at least four feet wide. Our proposal adds that shade be provided by one or both of two methods. A is one shade tree for every eight parking spaces, each space within 20 or excuse me 30 feet of the tree, or B solar canopies over parked cars to cover at least 50 percent of the paved parking lot. We found each of these amendments surprisingly close to home. The tree regulations are from Lexington's zoning bylaws. One tree for every eight spaces is a simple way to balance the area of the tree canopy with the pavement, and the 30 foot distance requirement distributes the trees on the lot. Provisions are also included to provide for the success of the tree and preserve existing ones. The solar panel or photovoltaic canopy language is taken from Arlington's zoning bylaws. It appears in the heat mitigation requirements for parking lots in our industrial zones, where solar panel canopies with 50 percent coverage are an available mitigation method. Both of these requirements are set up to provide for design flexibility and simple compliance calculations. All right, that's the next one. Thank you, Claire. As an example, let's use the Whole Foods parking lot. On the left is an aerial view of what we have with our current zoning. 81 parking spaces, zero shade trees, and zero solar panels. I'll note that the perimeter trees you see are growing on adjacent properties. On the right is a visual simulation of what we could have had with this bylaw amendment. In this case, we've used a 50-50 combination of trees and solar canopy to get 80 parking spaces, five shade trees, and 192 solar panels. Next slide, please. We're grateful for the board's substantial guidance in getting us to this point, where we believe this bylaw amendment would be beneficial and easily executed, and we respectfully ask for your support. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you very much. Anything else before we open this up to the board, since I know you just arrived? I was going to talk a little bit more about the specifics, in case you want to go in more. She's given us five minutes, and I think I may have taken it. You still have about a minute and a half left. So I sent you the memorandum, which explained that we switched out the tree to be proposed to plan a parking lot to be cared for under a USDA Forestry Service standard versus what you had in a couple of other sections. And then I sent a copy of the main motion. And since that time, did you mention about Steve's changes? No. Okay. So we have consulted with, Gene's been very useful. Steve has been great to work with, and they've helped us shape something that we hope the whole board will, or at least the majority will, vote for. We have lots of questions. Steve had some technical amendments that he felt were necessary. I'm not sure Gene agreed. You guys can talk about that. But we did, did you bring that memo? We did have a memo of, there were like five technical changes to like the use, the use tables that if you want to put in this, the solar panels are allowed. Great. And is this one of the documents that was submitted? No. We just did this because we just talked to Steve this week. Yeah. And we can provide it. Okay. If you could please provide it. Electronically. Yes. Yes. And we'd like to, to publish that with the meeting materials. Yes. Yes. Okay. And great. And we are at time. Yeah.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, great. Thank you so much. So what I, I know that you joined us just recently. What I had mentioned was the board will, I'll ask each of the board members for any questions or clarifications, final deliberation and voting will be at our, at our next hearing night, not this evening, but we will certainly make sure that all of the board members ask any clarifying questions. And if there's any discussion to be had after public comment, we will do so. Okay. So Ken, actually, why don't we start with Steve since it sounds like you have had some questions around some of the technical items. So Steve, if you could start us off with any questions or points of discussion.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 283</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. So I'll start off with a technical point for discussion. Okay. Back when the industrial district regulations were rewritten, one of the things that we, that was added to the bylaw was the definition for a, a ground mounted solar voltage, solar voltage system. If you go to the second slide, there's a picture of one. Right. Great. Yeah. And along with the definition was a, an entry in the use table that said this, this use is allowed in the industrial districts. Now there is a different section in the bylaw that basically, I'm sure my colleagues on the board, this is 522C that basically says anything in the use table that's not designated with a Y or a special permit is prohibited unless otherwise authorized by this bylaw. So my, you know, in order to make this more generally applicable, you know, my, my sort of technical feeling was that there should be use table entries declaring that the use is allowed in the districts where, you know, it's feasible and they've proposed R5, R6, R7, B2A, B4, and B5. Or there needs to be some language, you know, that satisfies the, unless otherwise authorized by this bylaw. But I didn't see anything in sort of like the 611, 6.1.11 tree that where these changes are proposed that would, you know, expand on what's in the use table in an obvious way. So my, my suggestion to the proponents was to add a couple of entries to basically the existing row of the use table. And that was the memo that we brought to you. If you, as a board, decide that, that that's necessary in order to provide.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 34</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. All right. Let's see. Steve, why don't you run through your, your items and I'll, I'll keep a running list here if there's anything else. That's really the main one. Okay. Great. Gene.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 174</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I saw this and I said I thought it was unnecessary because as Steve pointed out, 5.2.2 says anything that's not designated is prohibited unless otherwise authorized. And what the proponents do is basically, is basically authorize the solar canopy panels in parking lots. My concern with changing the use tables by putting the Y everywhere is it goes way beyond parking lots. Exactly. It would be the entire, every one of the zones. And number one, I think that's beyond the scope of this article. What I think may be more important is we haven't talked about whether that's a good idea, whether there should be standards for it, et cetera. So, I think we're better off not having that, the Y in there unless we're going to put in, in parking lots greater than 25 spaces, each one, complicating it. I think it's better not to have it in, rely on 5.2.2 because this authorizes solar panels. So, that's where Steve and I have a difference about how to accomplish this.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 111</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yes. And just as one possible way of, you know, addressing that and, you know, keeping the limitation to parking lots, you know, perhaps, you know, for, you know, for consideration, in the last section of the main motion, 6111B6B, simply adding a, something to the effect that this provision is applicable in the, in part, applicable for parking lots in the business and residential districts. You know, to me, that would, that would satisfy the, you know, unless offer, would be the, would satisfy the unless authorized by this by-law. Well, it's like built in suspension. Yeah, exactly. So, I don't think it's necessary. Yeah. That's all. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Shaina Korman-Houston - 539</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Gene, any other questions? No. Great. Shana. So, I just want to make sure that I'm reading the interplay between trees and solar properly because I know originally there was conversation about 50% shade from one or the other. And with that taken out from, on behalf of, or from the perspective of trees, could you, could you speak a little bit to the interplay of the combination? You know, if you're going to do a combination of solar and trees, how does that work? What are you, you know, are you trying to get to 50% shade coverage or what are you trying to do? So, we, it requires planting of trees every eight parking spaces, which we graphed out, and it looked like if you take any given area of parking spaces, that is about 50% shade coverage. The thought with having solar panels being, do the same thing, I have the same questions, like how does that work? But it seems that if it's a whole parking lot, that's easy, 50%. But it's going to be, but if it's a part of a parking lot, it's going to be some part of the parking lot. So, whatever part of the parking lot it is, if it's a quarter of a parking lot, then 12.5% of that quarter of the parking lot would be shaded. I think it's actually, I think that works. So, the notion, for example, and then the trees every eight spaces and the rest of it. So, the notion is essentially, if you can, if you are not achieving it all with solar, then you go do the trees. It, I don't know, to me didn't quite read clearly that way, but I follow you entirely with the idea. I don't know if it needs to be reworded a little bit for clarity, but I'm with you on concept. The one other piece I had a little, so I had a little concern about the 30 foot requirement. I think a tree for every eight parking spaces is a fine standard for argument's sake. I tried to sketch out where a tree could go to be within 30 feet of eight parking spaces, and there's really only one location that a tree can be. It would be essentially, if you have four parking spaces and then another, if you have parking spaces like this, the tree would have to be right there, which doesn't allow for a lot of flexibility in the layout of your parking spaces. So, it might be something to consider that 30 foot. Increasing that, if that makes sense. Increasing it or just looking at it, see what you think, to allow flexibility for the location. Or possibly in the discretion of the idea behind it, though, is to distribute the trees on the lot so they're not all planted in one place. Yes. So, that's the thought behind it. That's right, and my concern is not, again, the concept behind it. It's the actual technical, based on the size of parking spaces, I think it may end up limiting the layout of parking lots in a way that is not intended. So, that was all I had.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay great Ken yeah I'll go back to my original question when you first came up here and present this idea to us I had last time asked how many properties with this zoning effect you're saying only the large properties with 25 or more parking spaces I find it hard to count it on my hands how many spaces there are in Arlington that has 25 parking spaces I actually did a rough count perfect and it's not precise it's somewhere in the vicinity of 70 parking lots in Arlington that I could count from and we're still 25 spaces it's in that vicinity I won't say it's exactly that number but that I did go business spaces not not just residential I mean this is parking lots with 25 spaces including residential like the schools 70 yeah I didn't think it wouldn't be that much that's existing that's fine well I gave you my feelings earlier about how adding trees to parking lots to add an extreme burden on fostering businesses developing in Arlington I think we're trying to balance between the two and make it a mandate for having all these trees puts an extra burden on it and may stifle businesses I think I said well I said I'm personally I am supporter of the trees but can we find all the areas we can find low-hanging fruit where we can put trees and I did mention that let's look at some street trees or in public areas where we can do that where we can offset parking spaces and have tree islands or having vegetation vegetation at corners for stormwater stream before it goes in the sewer all that stuff is something that if we are really truly concerned about heat islands I think we should start with those first as an agenda as opposed to let's look at new development and let's put a put more criteria on it so so we hinder that that was my opinion and I expressed last time and I still have that okay and that was one thing and then when I look at this illustration right here I count four trees you added not five one in the corner if you look carefully it's down by the hood it's it's um it's in the corner yeah okay yeah I'm sorry it blended in I'm not saying it you didn't have five trees I'm just saying I could find five truths yeah okay when you guys did that I know you guys don't have professionals and all everything else just do it a solar study on this because the way I look at these all those trees surrounding that solar field you got in the parking lot there there might not be enough sunlight coming down on the solar panels to make it feasible I'm not saying it is or isn't but I'm just saying can you think I think that's something you take a look at recently I just had solar panel for my house and the first thing they added is that they asked me was what kind of shade trees you have around your house if there's too much shade trees it doesn't make any sense with solar panels there so if we're gonna do this combination that you talked about we got we gotta look more carefully about that and say hey you know that's the whole food right on Mass Ave and if we put those why I want to see let's say the trees okay I'm not gonna say numbers okay with those then and existing trees shaded for so many hours it doesn't make sense with solar panels there so you so you're making a request on someone to do something that doesn't make any sense that's why there's an option but yeah I'm just these are questions I have right now okay I'm not saying you know I spring this up as that I think that's all I have for now I mean I think yeah I'm supportive of the notion I'm just not supportive of putting an extra burden and also the fact that combination the two that goes there just they come complicates I think there's a lot of low-hanging fruit which you can get for shade shade trees and and get rid of the heat islands that is not focused on this one commercial or residential development here you know I think it's a way of discouraging future growth and I'm sure I'm not that's you're not your goal here I think your goal is good so that's what I have</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? and Kin Lau - 500</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great Thank You Ken the question I have for you is around the selection of the standard that you have set the USDA Forest Service tree owners owners manual standards and I know that we had when you came with this pre proposal several meetings ago we had talked about whether or not we should include a specific standard or refer to other standards that may be set in town through for example the tree warden and the reason I asked the question around this particular selection is that we we do try and not in the in the bylaws specifically cite references because they change and are updated so regularly so my question is whether this was kind of done in concert with the tree warden or if there was any discussion around you know potentially referencing standards which have been set by the town and you know if there is a way to do that without putting a specific standard into the section previously on the new zoning section requiring street trees planted every 25 feet by developers it says there'll be a care for 36 months pursuant to the American standards of nursing stock standards and I thought and so I just carried that language over to ours being okay well that's what the ARB wants to see and that makes sense to me but then I looked it up and I saw that that that citation actually applies to pre-planting choice of stock in locations and things like that and so we talked to the tree warden about a did he agree that that's what this said which he did agree and B did he have suggestions to what we could use instead of that assuming that you would like a standard since you have a standard in this other section and he came up with the the USDA Forest Service tree owner's manual which is an amazing document and it's been around I think I think it's first there's an old version on the website it was 2008 it's been updated I think it was maybe 2015, 2018, 2020 so it seems to be a very he likes it it seems great I'm going to use it in my yard and also we have written in there or other standard as the ARB managed to use we kind of did the best we could there if you want us to take out that specific standard right I mean I it's in multiple places and I think the or other is is cited once and again I'm trying to make this as simple as possible so that's why I asked the question and I had suggested in my memo that it's probably too late but it would be nice to amend that language in the tree every 25 feet to the tree owner's manual standard versus the nursery and again they they change regularly so that this is this is why I asked the question yeah</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank you madam chair crystal ready Adams you know in general I support this I do have a number of questions though and would like some clarification you know before voting on this town meeting number first to mr. allows question about how often this would apply I think the question is over the past 20 years how many parking lots would this apply to how many developments would this you want to know that answer it out I won't take the time to give you know to listen now but I would guess maybe only Sims because this only applies to outdoor parking spaces as I read it and you know the trend now is to build underneath the building whenever possible in related to this since it only applies to 25 as I read the zoning bylaw that means those developments are already going to be before you for farmers design review any reach residential development or more than six units is before you any non-resident residential development of more than 10 units 10 parking spaces is before you why can't you require this now also I'm not sure that's the reason not to pass this but I don't think this imposes really any more additional burden upon the developers unless you're requiring more area for the trees to be in as I again as I read the proposed change you're not requiring more area be set aside from the parking lot area that is currently required it's just a matter of the type of vegetation that goes in there whether it's trees or some other types of vegetation so I think that it covers all my comments I'm a little confused so on the solar aspects of it how the requirements in the parking lots will relate to any requirements on the roof of buildings and I wouldn't want to see the requirements that if they do use the option of putting the solar panels in the parking lot I don't want that to reduce the requirements on the roofs of the buildings I don't think it does but I think that's fair because there was some parathetical comment in the proposed language about referring to the solar requirements in the industrial district but it wasn't clear how those two are related thank you very much all right we had another hand raise please John Leone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm John Leone, I'm here with my sister Suzanne Leone and I'm sorry before you begin referencing the the challenges that some people in the background if you wouldn't mind just speaking up that would be appreciated. John Leone, I'm here with my sister Suzanne Leone Suzanne and I together are the trustees of the AML Realty Trust and also my wife Pauline. AML Realty Trust is a family trust composed of myself and my siblings. My grandparents originally bought this house back in 1956 and it's been in our family ever since and Suzanne actually lives there. So it's not an investment for our family Five to seven winter street is one of the largest parcels in East Arlington being over 18,000 square feet it's right now surrounded by a neighborhood multifamily district As you can see on the chart, it's the house in yellow the dark shaded Parcels are all now in the multifamily district the light blue is the summit house and over to the right kind of a purpley color is the Fox library, which as we all know the town is now exploring to Rebuild with a multi-family multi-story building above it if feasible So our contention is we should have been included in the multifamily district On the first time around I brought this before town meeting last year and it failed by six votes I've spoken to several of the town meeting members who voted against it and they now Can see what our thought process was If we if all of the other buildings around us built to the allowed height of four or five stories and on Mass Ave that row of Stores, which we refer to as basically taxpayers went to six stories. We would be surrounded by multifamily Apartment houses and we would never be able to do anything to the house not that we have any plans to do so, but it would be forever precluded from doing that and if the bottom of the L if the other Property owners on that on winter street or Cleveland approached us and wanted to buy that little portion to increase their lot size It would be of no benefit to them because it's not in the district If we wanted to we recognize the house is on the National Historic District List but so is number 13 and 15 those big parcels down Winter Street That are two houses down from us they're also included I asked both the Arlington Historic Commission and the planning department if they had a Comprehensive list. I don't think we really have one of all the buildings on it. So for all I know For all we know other buildings may be included in the multifamily district I think that might have been the original reason to leave us off But I don't think it's a valid reason just because two other houses on the same street are on So we would we're here to ask that We'd be included within the district Again, not that we have any plans to do anything We like the house. We like the barn out back But we want to preserve our rights for the future and If we ever decide to sell it as a family that whoever buys it would have those rights preserved Great anything else? Well, you talked to one of your neighbors Oh, none of my yeah, I guess the notes went out but no one has approached me to ask about it Okay Cards went out To the neighbors. We haven't heard anything back That would include every all the abutters everybody in the summit house because it's a condo now. I think she said radius of 300 feet.

Mm-hmm. Okay, so There was quite a few properties were we're looking at at the time trying to get this going and Boundaries were going in and out from Mass Ave and a whole bunch of all the things that we're trying to deal with Trying to just address everybody's issues best we could and I'm just let you know what our initial intent was it was not to Select you guys at all, but I'm just letting you guys know what we're trying to do It's like you guys at all by No, we appreciate giving you guys out. Okay, it was not our intent but as far as Giving us ability. I have no issues with that. I think it gives you relief Especially the business districts which are really really shallow there. There's really not much you can do there It actually As a deterrent for doing anything here, but what's there now the way it's doing Front spaces along Mass Ave. So shallow you can't do much bathing there You really need to combine spaces To actually do something which may or may not happen. I'm not saying that right. So I have no No issues with that. It's just You talk to the historic Commission. I spoke to Julian Robinson and what was her comments back on this? She she just made Me aware, which I already knew that there is a anything that happens to that house not the property of the house has to go through them and Yeah, and they would have to approve any changes If anyone in the future ever decided they wanted to knock it down there is a two-year demolition delay That's that sort of thing and being on the National Historic Register. There's Over the overlay of additional Requirements to keep the house nice We have been we actually just put in the roof on it, so we're not going anywhere Could I ask another question? Oh Was it historic it was already historic Registered when you bought the building or no, it became that way while you own the building. So you had the option well to do so or not to so You know, we were they my grandparents bought in 56 and I think it was around the mid 70s I think I provided the Registration materials to the clerical department And I Remember discussing with my dad prior to his passing and he just said when it happened it just happened They were never really told it was going to happen. It's just all of a sudden one day. They were informed. You're now in the historic register There wasn't no public hearing or discussion just got submitted and approved It's on the historic register because it's a classic shingle style Queen Anne Victorian So it's for architectural purposes Any other questions, okay Shana</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I I have no problem with your Proposal I do have some questions about the process So the zoning bylaw requires two types of notice and I just want to make sure They were both done. The first says and we haven't seen this the petition which is what you file Show that copies of the petition have been sent by registered or certified mail To all owners and immediate abutters of the land Referred to in the petition and then the department Sends it out by first-class mail To a wider group what I would need to see to vote favorably on this Is the notice of registered or certified now? To all the owners and immediate abutters of the land referred to in the petition. So that's It's a two-part requirement I mentioned this when you're in a few months ago So I have a question Send the Basically, you want to send the proposed warrant article to the abutters? What what this says is is When a petition for a change in the zoning map is filed, which is what you're doing Such petitions shall show that copies of the petition have been sent By registered or certified mail to all owners and immediate abutters of the land Referred to in the petition One right then before this hearing the department sends out first-class mail To a much larger piece. So I'm feeling like we need to see the Registered and certified mail piece as the first piece of that. So so I just have a question regarding that the summit house We send it to the condo association or to each of the individual owners It says to all owners and immediate abutters of the land and You know someone came in a couple of years ago. Mm-hmm with with a petition to Rezone, I think two or three parcels on Massachusetts Avenue, and he was complained a little about the requirement, but he did that. Oh, no, we have Doing it. I just said So we need to I need to see that we have no problem sending it out to the abutters But the you're looking for the definition that that's something that perhaps we can have Mike Cunningham Clarify for you very quickly to make sure that we get that done Correct anything procedural.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Shelly Dean and I live at 7 Cleveland Street And I have mostly questions And in general I am supportive of Increasing the density of housing options in Arlington Some of my questions have to do with and and just in in terms of comments that I've had from some neighbors They're not familiar Necessarily with what is allowed under the neighborhood multifamily sub-district So some neighbors mentioned to me. Oh, they're getting it approved as a two-family and I said, no I don't think that's right. So just there may be some information that would be helpful to explain to neighbors My question really had to do with the fact that when I went online and I looked at what I thought was the most recent MBTA communities map It differed slightly from the map up here so that on the L-shaped section those two sort of short short parcels, which I don't know how to describe them better exactly those two we're not We're not on the map that I saw we're not designated as neighborhood multifamily Sub-district and Similarly, I think the lot right next to the Fox Library on Cleveland Street is also not on the on this Town's map for MBTA communities is not in in gray so so my question is whether this is whether this is the accurate map or the one on this on the town's website is and Just my concern was that and this is not my personal concern because I'm not immediately abutting the site I'm on the other side of Cleveland Street, but if I was in fact either living at what I'm speculating is 9 and 11 Winter Street and what I'm speculating is maybe 6 or 8 Cleveland Street, I'm not quite sure what the numbers are But that there would be a tall building on one side an allowable neighborhood Multifamily sub-district on the other side, but the property in between So I just want to you know, if you can clarify that that would be really helpful great Thank you very much. This should be the most updated map that we have if there's a map that doesn't that is That does not match this on the website and it's changing. Okay, because the map on the website does say final so so I was like Ha we will we will we will ensure that that is aligned Well, I you know, I just I just feel like the you know Neighbors should should really understand what what's happening and and I guess just the last comment I would make which is neither here nor there is I agree with the comment earlier that That you raised which is the properties on Mass Ave are just so shallow that Those it seems really unlikely that those will be developed as taller buildings unless they're combined With the properties right next to them But in general I think Density makes sense. So I just want to make sure that we're not going to create these valleys in between Taller buildings. Thank you.</blockquote>

Yeah, I just have some procedural questions about this I was one of those town meeting members who didn't know how to vote for it vote on it. And so I voted with the board but the Question and the reason I did that is the is the board At the 11th hour dropped all of Mass Ave in East Arlington community communities District and the rationale was that that was all going to be rezoned To some other For some other purposes and my assumption was that the reason this parcel was dropped is that it would have been included with that rezoning for the rest of East Arlington given the Shallowness of the lots in front of it And yet I haven't heard anyone talk about the rezoning of all of All of that part of Mass Ave, but I'm wondering my questions Is that going to occur and if so should this parcel be part of that rezoning rather than part of the MBTA communities? So that that's one question The other question is everyone's talking about the MBTA communities Bylaw change is a done deal, but it has not been approved by the Attorney General And if I read the legal notice in the advocate recently correctly It may not be approved if anyone objects to the defect in the hearing notice So, I'm wondering is it even possible to amend the zoning bylaw that hasn't yet been changed it's not on the books So I'll leave those questions up to you, but it seems strange to me that when the bylaws not get changed You know we can go through this process of amending it and it doesn't even exist in an approved form yet.

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Caitlin Monaghan - 585</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you. I'm Caitlin Moynihan, 43 Highland. Thanks so much for giving me the chance to talk to you about this today. Can you speak up, please? I'll try. Just in the interest of full transparency, my lot is one of the ones that would be directly impacted by this warrant article in the past. Next slide, please. So the goal of warrant article 32 is just to amend section 5 through 12, which ensures traffic visibility by putting restrictions on the placement and height of buildings, fences and vegetation. It does this in two subsections, one section A, which ensures visibility of the corners, and section B, where it ensures visibility from driveways. In section A, the way it does this is it defines this triangle that's 20 feet by 20 feet, so basically a 200 square foot area in most cases. And it says that nothing above three feet can be there unless it's a shade tree. Next slide, please. For the section 5 through 12B, it has a similar sort of structure in that it has a zone where there are limitations. In this case, the zone is the five feet in front of the property and the limitation is a limitation of two and a half feet in height. However, section 5 through 12B also adds one additional element that's absent in 5 through 12A, which is it includes the possibility of an exception. And it uses the language that this limitation is in place unless it can be shown that the vegetation or structure will not restrict visibility in such a way as to hinder the safe entry of a vehicle from any driveway to the street. And if that's the case, you can go above the height limit. So I think we can all agree that there are a lot of types of fences and vegetation that would be completely unsafe if you put them either next to a corner or next to a driveway. However, there are also many fences that are more than three feet in height but don't really include the view of traffic. And under the current bylaws, you would be allowed to put these next to a driveway, but you're not allowed to put them next to a street corner. Next slide, please. This is a problem, in my opinion, because it discourages the use of fences that are an adequate height to actually protect children and pets. So if we look at what the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care stipulates for child care centers in the state, they require that there be a certain permanently installed barrier, which is at least four feet in height if there's a hazard nearby, such as a busy street. If we look at our own Arlington's own bylaws, there's a requirement that if you have a hazard like a swimming pool, that needs to be surrounded by a fence that's five feet high. Next slide, please. So my proposal, then, is to update Section 5.3.12a with language that's adapted from 5.3.12b in order to just add the words unless it can be shown that the building structure or vegetation will not restrict visibility in such a way as to hinder the safe transit of a vehicle through the intersection. And in doing that, I think we can completely preserve the original intent of the bylaw but also allow fences that are tall enough to protect children and pets. Thank you. That's all I have.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you very much. I will turn it over to Steve to start with any questions or comments. That was a good observation. You're right. There are two sections of the bylaw. Some sections sensibly deal with traffic visibility. And one has a provision that makes exceptions if you can demonstrate maintaining sight lines and the other doesn't. I think your proposal is entirely reasonable. I have no further questions. Great. Thank you. Gene.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 1224</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm just curious. Who makes this decision? I mean, if you're going to put up a fence that's four feet tall or bushes or whatever, who gets to make this decision? Who's in charge of this? I couldn't figure that out. And if we're going to add, and I'm not necessarily opposed to the concept, but if we're going to add something to the zoning bylaw that says, unless it can be shown such and such, I want to know who gets to look at it and say, yeah, you're right. And I think we need to know that. And I don't know, Claire, whether the building department has to approve fences and bushes. Because if they don't, we're in no man's land here as to what to do about this. All right. So the question is, does the building department, it's not planning. That I know. Yeah. So I think it's important to know that because if we don't know the answer, we need to write something that indicates how this is actually going to be processed. Gene, isn't it? If it's a zoning article, it's zoning issues that it's the building commission that's responsible to enforce that? Well, we just need to understand that. We should probably talk to them. So we can follow up with Inspector Ciampa, unless you've already spoken with Inspector Ciampa. No, I figured you all would know much better than I do because whatever it is in Section 5 through 12B, that's what I'm envisioning for 5 through 12A. Fair enough. I think we should talk to Ciampa. Okay. We can do that before our next meeting. And figure out how this would work. Because you don't usually need a permit for a non-structural fence, right? So that would be under six feet. Right. So we need to, and I think Mike needs to understand this is coming and what it would mean for him. That's all I have. Good observation. Thank you. Shana? I guess my only other observation or question is, is there a distinction between fences and vegetation that would need to be, or that should be made just because the visibility with fences and vegetation are by nature very different. And it's very easy for vegetation to get out of hand pretty quickly unintentionally. We've done a lot of talking, I think, about inspectional services and compliance and can we hire someone to do compliance work and come to the conclusion, I think, that someone walking around and looking at the height of bushes is unlikely to happen. Which is probably where it may have originated from, knowing that compliance was a challenge. That's right. Ken? I also just want to add one more thing where you say that, let's prove that the fences impair vision. That's so subjective. Going back to Jesus, who's going to view this? But also, that person may change from time to time. And now all of a sudden, oh, well this worked before and this doesn't work now. So I think, I would suggest tightening up a little bit, saying anything above three feet needs to be 50% viewable or open. I'm not sure what the right word is, but something like that along those lines. I think they have that in the measures. And I also would encourage you I would encourage you to maybe, if you're concerned about safety in the residential corners, to maybe hook up with the tree committee there and look about adding some storm rain gardens at the corners. Are you aware of that? Yeah. That would also help the safety of the corners there, because now you're shortening the crosswalk on the street and now there's a garden up here that's lower that would allow more visibility and more safety. Because now, I'm not saying no to that, but now you have more of that chamfer and the sidewalk and the rain garden. It's that much more. I'm just encouraging, if that's something you're serious about, I would say, look, maybe that's something you also might want to chamfer. I was trying to keep this as completely narrow as possible by changing almost no language and directly copying from one region to another. I agree the likelihood of there being vegetation or a structure that is transparent that seems very unlikely, like a plexiglass shed. What would that even be? But I wanted to just stick to... I assumed that the original language was acceptable to actually... There's a hidden slide at the end. There are a few things... Okay, it's too hidden. I think there are several things we could tighten up in the language of the zoning bylaw. There is the way that the corner is defined. It talks about the intersection of tangents in a way that perhaps I don't remember calculus, but I don't think that means what it seems to think it means. Also, some language about above the plane of the curb rain. There are things that I think could be said a little bit more clearly as well as things defined. I love the idea of 50% transparency because right now with the dragways, it's just completely subjective and enforced by who knows who. You are not wrong. Anything else before we open up for public comment? I'd like to ask you to think about this. It seems like the thing you're interested in is being able to put a fence up and you can have fences that you can see through. Rather than what you've done, and I understand you copied it from somewhere else in the zoning bylaw, you could ask whether that was done very well, but we won't go there. It might be easier if you said except for a see-through fence. Then we wouldn't have anybody having to make a decision or anything like that. You could put up a see-through fence. Or a fence with X percentage or more visibility. That might be a really easy way to fix this. Sorry, Jean. I didn't hear a word you said. Sorry. It might be a lot easier if it just said instead of what is in here now, if it just says except for a fence that you can see through or 50% transparent or something like that, then we don't have to get judgments made or anything like that. And the reason it's helpful is if you look at the zoning bylaw, structure is defined to include a fence among other things. So that's why I'm suggesting just saying except for a transparent fence, we can figure out what the language would be. And that might be the easiest way to accomplish what you want. Any other comments or questions? Like I said, I don't foresee any transparent other structures or vegetation. We can figure out how to do that. Would it be possible for us to also fix 5312B in the same way? Let's look at the language of your motion. You referenced 5.3.12A in your article. So I don't believe that 5.3, not that I don't think it should change, but I don't know that we could. And Gene, you're always a great arbiter of this. I don't know that 5.3.12B would fall within scope is how I'm reading this. Yes. Okay. I appreciate that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Carl Wagner, 30 Edge Hill Road, and a town meeting member. I put a fence up at my house when I moved into it. It is not on a corner, and I learned some of the rules for fences. I would make an observation that these nice fences that may be on the recording or maybe folks here can see, I believe they're all three or very close to three feet or less. So they're not representative of a fence that is high. Certainly not on a corner either. You can see it in some of the cases anyway. So I'd like to make the observation that I believe the rules the town has seem very sensible, and they are quite right at the moment, which is you don't need a permit. You just have to follow the rules. I believe my house was two and a half feet in front of my house to the street. And then on the sides, you can go up to six, but you have to rise up. If you want to go around those rules, I believe you come and see the ZBA or the ARB, and that also seems to be a very logical and appropriate way for an applicant, such as the one who has this article, to make changes, to ask if it's okay. And when one takes the needs of the applicant, which may be measurable about dogs or whatever other reason, that's important. But it's very important that thousands of people who use the streets, the sidewalks, bicyclists, children, pedestrians, other drivers, also have their needs met. And so I hope that you'll consider that we already have good laws for how you put a fence up in Arlington, including on a corner, and that the applicant can come and get a variance potentially if it makes sense for the applicant's needs versus the needs of all the thousands of people who live here and safely have to use the area around our houses. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anyone else who has a comment or question on Article 32?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Chris Loreti - 465</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Madam Chair. Chris Laredi, Adams Union. Claire, could you bring up the slide that shows the triangle for the area that this would apply to? Yeah, so if you look at the slide on the left, I believe the applicant has presented in a way that is not the way that the bylaw is interpreted or at least has been historically interpreted. And the bylaw uses weird language that says, it talks about between the property lines of intersecting streets. Traditionally, that has been, as I understand it, has been the curb line of the street, not the street right-of-way, which is shown there, the inner lines of the sidewalks. And if you go back to the zoning bylaw, before it was re-quantified, there were a lot of illustrations about how it should be interpreted. And if you look at the illustration that corresponds to this, it's pretty clear to me that they were measuring that 20 feet, not from the right-of-way line, but from the curb line. And once you do that, that triangle becomes a lot smaller than what is shown on this illustration. And for that reason alone, I think this change is not necessary. As for the question of enforcement, I've had experience with that, and it has been the building inspector. I objected once when the stockade fence was put right up to the sidewalk next to the driveway, and he went and had the people reduce it in accordance with the bylaw. I don't think the exception to bylaw, to my knowledge, has never been applied. Because once the building inspector gets that objection, he doesn't say, well, maybe you could show that it doesn't affect anything. He just enforces it without even considering the possibility of that inspection. So I don't think the change is proposed would actually do anything anyway. I think the bylaw as it stands, as Mr. Wagner said, is correct as it is. And while I appreciate that the applicant may like their dog, I think the importance of safety to pedestrians far outweighs the minor increase in area that the dog would have to run around in a fenced place. But the other thing I was gonna say is certainly, oh, I don't want this applied to buildings either, and the way that the change is written, you would allow buildings in that area based on the exception. I don't think that's appropriate. Certainly if somebody's just sticking a Plexiglas banner on top of the fence to raise it up another foot or so, it shouldn't be objectionable. But in general, I don't think there's anything wrong with the bylaw as it stands now. And certainly as a town meeting, I would not support this in its current form. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Any other comments? All right. Please. Great. I would, as just a counterpoint to Mr. O'Brady's excellent point that yes, this triangle would almost not even intersect with the yard if it were at the corner. I think that would, in a lot of ways, make a lot more sense because why would the safety margin be dependent upon how big the sidewalks are? That said, I do think there is a need for something along the lines of this Warren Hart cult, regardless, because there are plenty of streets that don't have any sidewalk at all and it would still be necessary to do something to treat those comparably to other properties. I could understand the objection potentially that by putting up a fence, if there is no sidewalk, then this might also be a hazard for pedestrians. I think that if that's the case, we should consider why we currently allow fences up to that line as long as they're less than three feet in height. I don't think if a car's coming that I want to dive into a three-foot hedge, that that would be particularly safer than having the four-foot fence. Thank you. All right, so with that, we will end public comment for Article 32</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see if the Town will vote to amend the Zoning Bylaw Section 5.5.2, Dimensional and Density Regulations, to adjust the rear yard setback requirement for uses of four or more stories in the Business Districts; or take any action related thereto.</blockquote>

and move to our next article, which is Article 33, a zoning bylaw amendment related to rear yard setbacks in the business districts, and I will turn it over to Director Ricker for any initial comments. No comments from the department on this amendment. As a concern of the requester, Andy Greenspun has registered voters. Great, thank you very much. If you could introduce yourself first, last name and address, you'll have up to five minutes to present your proposed article.
</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Andy Greenspon - 720</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, my name is Andy Greenspun. I live at 89 Palmer Street. Here's the board article language just for reference to adjust rear yard setbacks requirements for uses of four or more stories in the business district. Next. This is the actual change. This is, if you recall it, the special fall town meeting last year, we simplified the ways to determine the setbacks that used to be for rear yard setbacks in the business district. It used to be some sort of formula involving length plus height divided by six, among other things, so it was simplified to these sort of definitions here, but at the time, I noticed a little too late that if you go from, with the current existing language, if you go from three stories to four stories, the rear yard setback for all the stories has to go, when the budding residential has to go from 20 feet all the way to 30 feet, so the proposed motion here is just that for the first three stories, the rear yard setback stays at 20 feet, and then for four or higher stories, the rear yard setback has to be 30 feet for those stories. Next. Here's the most basic image to sort of convey the point. This is the current zoning, so if you have a three story business building next to a residential, if you go up to four stories, you have to pull the entire building back. Next. This is what the language, as I understand it, that I'm proposing would change to so that just the higher stories have that setback since for the first three stories, you're already at the 20 feet. Why would you then suddenly shift all those back? Next. The reasoning has to do with economic feasibility of the construction, especially since Arlington has a lot of small lots, especially in the business districts. If a parcel is zoned to allow four or five stories already and there are separate height and story restrictions that are in other parts for different types of business districts, if you're already allowed to go to four stories, if you have to then shrink the entire footprint of the building an extra 10 feet in these small lots, it may prevent the economic feasibility and harm the ability to grow small businesses. So the example here is you have a parcel that has a width, or a building that has a width of 100 feet, a depth of 60 feet. For three stories, that would be 18,000 square feet. With the current zoning, if you wanted a fourth floor, you have to decrease the depth for all the stories so you'd only get 20,000 square feet, so you'd only get a net increase of 2,000 square feet for all the construction costs to go to four stories and that doesn't even include points of egress, maybe elevators, things that would take up more of the space. With the proposed amendment, this would change to allowing, let me see if I read this right, you would be able to get 23,000 square feet totals. So since you can get an extra 3,000 square feet on the top floor, relative to status quo, it could be economically feasible. Next slide. Yeah, I think I stated this basically already, but we want to make it so where extra stories are allowed in the business districts already, we want the floor plate to be useful and economically, financially viable. Existing zoning already sets different story heights for a reason and this change shouldn't have any impacts on shadows since for three story building, you already are allowed to have just a 20 foot setback. If you're adding the extra higher stories that already in the existing zoning are 30 foot back, I don't think it should change shadows towards the adjacent residential. Next. Just for comparison, in Somerville's form zoning code, they do basically the same thing. Mid-Rise is the equivalent to our business district or mixed use districts and their neighborhood residential is similar to our R0, R1, and R2 and they have the same thing where the first, first to third stories abutting neighborhood residential is 20 foot setback, rear setback, and then everything higher is 30 foot setback. I think that's it.</blockquote>

I generally don't have any questions. I'm supportive of this. I should be very much supportive of this. I do have one suggestion. Graphically, would you have your section right there? Yes. See the vertical line? Will you measure off 20 feet and 30 feet? Yes. Can you just rotate some text and say property line? It just makes it easier. It's just minor, it's very minor. Just so people realize that pole is not really a, it's the property line between residential and thing. That was the way you, when I first looked at it, I thought it was just different pictures.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl Wagner, 30 Edge Hill Road. And town meeting member. I'd like to read an email that came from an engineer who reviewed this. If one were to apply the horizontal scale to the height of the supposed buildings, it would lead to the amazing conclusion that a typical story is only five and a half feet high. The blue business district four story buildings should actually be about 50 feet tall, more than twice as high as they are shown. And the unlabeled side yard setback for the house, that's the left to right horizontal side back, is drawn at essentially a generous 13 feet, rather than the five to 10 feet that is typical for East Arlington. I would ask Madam Chair and members of the board that the diagrams and graphics, as well as all information that are supporting the proposal, be given to you in proper scale. That's the first thing that one sees. I would also point out that in this very room, prior to the special town meeting, the major changes that resulted in the status quo that the proponent is hoping to make even larger, those changes didn't have any public input after the spring town meeting before. There was no chance for the public to weigh in. Why is it so important? Well, if you have business district next to business district or business next to business, it's not so important. But the residents pay the taxes. They're the ones who come home from jobs here. And the residents are that red house on the left. They're the people who are going to be incredibly inconvenienced with solar panels and shading if we get this wrong. The application's giving you a deceptive, perhaps unintentionally deceptive graphic. And the situation deserves to be studied better by us and the people who might live in these houses and buildings that are next to business districts. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

I'm going to leave my mask on because- Totally fine, if you could just- I have this head cold going on. Please just project as much as you can. Thank you. Sure, sure. I want to actually echo Mr. Wagner's comments. I, we had quite, I don't know, fraud is the right term, but the town meeting last year, the special town meeting dealing with the MBTA Communities Act was a significant effort. It caused significant consternation in town. It came to a subtle conclusion, unlike Milton, but it did happen. And I'm thinking that continued work of this manner, chipping away at the various current zoning rules relative to height, setbacks, and the pressure between business interests versus residential interests that Mr. Wagner just laid out. I'm thinking that probably this is too quickly re-engaging on issues that were already discussed at last year's town meeting and brought to conclusion with significant discussion. I'm not sure why we're engaging on this again so quickly, these sorts of issues so quickly after just having settled what was a somewhat divisive situation. And I think we need to have a bit of a safe harbor approach to changes for a bit after last year. I'm not, I know that there are certain things we need to continue to do year after year and continue to work on evolving things, but this sounds an awful lot like what I heard last year. And I would recommend that the board perhaps not consider taking a vote of approval of this so quickly after last year's special town meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments? Please. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Wynelle Evans - 174</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnell Evans, Orchard Place. I think one thing about zoning changes in Arlington is so much of Arlington is non-conforming. And I question this in areas where the rear setbacks of the abutting residential property are not the required 20 feet. For instance, my backyard, which does not abut the potential fee district, but my backyard is about 14 or 15 feet deep on a very, very small lot. And there are many, many lots, many parcels like this in town, particularly in East Arlington. And to point out the scale on that is a little bit off because a four-story building, business building, would probably be closer to 50 feet. And for a residence with a short, less deep backyard, that's gonna be really a looming presence. That's gonna be all you see when you look out of some of your windows. So I think that without taking non-conforming lots into consideration, this needs quite a bit more thought. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any other comments? Please.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Madam Chair. Again, Chris Laredi, 66 Adams Street. Just a few comments on this. One, I thought when we adopted this change in time, meaning last fall, it was the Somerville regulations, you know, verbatim. And I'm not sure for which zoning district it was in Somerville before. I'm not sure why they need to change. Not that they've changed in Somerville, but that's my first question. If they were good enough last fall, aren't they good enough now? Second is, you know, I appreciate Mr. Wagner's comments on the scale. If you're going to do a drawing, you need to put dimensions on it. You need to make them scalable in the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The other thing I would add is that typically the backyard, rear yard in the business district, is the side yard in the residential district. And typically the side yard setbacks for existing homes is more like five feet. And that's way smaller than what is shown on this drawing. And I think the buildings themselves in the business district should be shown at their maximum height, not some artificially lowered height. Another thing this introduces is inconsistency in the terminology in the bylaw. What is now being referred to as the upper-story setback is what you call a step-back in other contexts. And I think you need to deal with that issue as well. And you get two different, you know, you get setbacks and step-backs, and you're going to cause a lot of confusion as this is written. You're going to cause a lot of confusion as this is written. And then finally, my final comment is the same as I had on for the MBTA Communities Act bylaw change. And that again, as far as I understand it, this bylaw change from last fall has not yet been approved by the Attorney General. Again, there was a defect in the notice for the hearing on it. And if I understand the procedure correctly, if anyone objects to the town clerk within a couple weeks, she can't approve it. So again, can we approve a bylaw change for the bylaw that hasn't yet been changed? So I'll leave it at that. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just a few things. I consulted with— checked with members of ARB about the language regarding setback and stepback. I'm pretty sure it's consistent. There's just different terminology because there's no stepback for rear yard. So it's a setback. So it's consistent as far as I know. Regarding the question of relative size, I can change that for the diagram. But at the end of the day, currently you can build to the 20 feet with three stories already. So whether it's looming or not, that exists in these areas in the status quo. So this is just letting you have the higher part of the building be step back to what I think is good for being near residential. I think I'll leave it at that. Great. Thank you for the clarifications. All right. At this point—Gene, did you have anything else? Okay. At this point, we will end comment on Article 33. Thank you so much. Can you take up that for me?

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Lewicke  - 724</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Thank you very much. I have quite a lot of prepared material. So hopefully we won't necessarily get to all of it right here. First of all, I'd like to thank the board for their guidance when we went through last time. I think that's helped us refine our proposal. I very much appreciate that. Again, for the benefit of everyone, we're proposing to allow both two-family and three-family dwellings by right throughout Arlington. And to do that while keeping all the existing dimensional requirements in place. So existing setbacks, et cetera, et cetera. If you could actually go to the next slide. One more. So we were a little unsure on our approach last time. There's kind of been a question on the quantum of both for town meeting and we found your comments very persuasive that it wouldn't make sense to go ahead with three-family without allowing two-family in those districts. So that's, we're going to list the effect with quantum of both. We're going to keep that in there. Okay. Also, we found your comments on site plan review likewise persuasive. We would like to incorporate it. However, at the point when the current draft language of the article was submitted, we didn't have a proposed set of language for that. But if you go to the next slide, we were considering going with approach like this where there'd be kind of an asterisk or something in the use table and there'd be a note that site plan review would be required. I know there was some discussion in some of your earlier meetings about kind of what the rules and regulations for site plan review should be. And to kind of allow that to be used in other circumstances in the zoning bylaw. We think this would be a good approach, but we very much would like to be guided by you and what language you'd like to see. And kind of in our opinion, it's something that makes sense to include for kind of new two-family development in R0 and R1 and new three-family development in all three districts. Unfortunately, the biggest question by far for this has been the question of wanting to vote. The state's housing choice law is intended to kind of make it easier to have three-family by right rolled out throughout the state. It's been a little bit unclear to us whether that applies to also allowing two-family town council is consulting with the attorney general's office on it. And it's so far it's going to be our intent to withdraw it if it comes back as a two-thirds requirement. And we'll be the first to let you know when we hear. So, I can go more in depth on the projections, but basically I tried to do an exercise similar to what Steve put together for MBTA communities last fall to kind of go through at the parcel level and simulate development. Kind of most trying to use similar assumptions around the basic development rate would be twice the rate for existing teardowns, complete redevelopments with a variety of other modifiers. It's kind of a little bit of a I got it all working, but the difference between Steve's projections and these projections is that there are so many fewer parcels for the MBTA communities district that the randomness of the draw really actually provides a spread in outcomes. So there's a slide a little bit later on showing kind of the expected developments by year and it's just a straight line and that's just a product of the fact that you've got so many thousands of units to draw from. In reality, we expect it to be a noisier basis and also that the you basically get very close to the original assumptions that I think it was like 0.46 percent chance that as the base assumption and after all the modifiers and after everything else you get like a 0.48 percent chance. So it's kind of I thought it was interesting. I was kind of assuming probably more would be so basically when I was going through the projections we were assuming Do you want us to show the results slide? Would that be? Yeah, probably. Yeah, let's give the results. If you have questions, we can get into that.</blockquote>

You get 560 parcels total redeveloped over those that 10-year period. 726 new dwelling units, etc. I think the important takeaway from this is that if you want to have a different assumption on the pace of redevelopment, if you think okay, hey that twice the if that's too conservative, this is a small enough fraction then redeveloped that you can actually just multiply by whatever rate you think applies. So if you think okay, well you want to go full 10 times or whatever that you can just kind of extrapolate from here. Yeah, I think we could, I'm glad to answer any more questions on the projections later on, but probably better take detail ones. Annie, talk a little bit about the...</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I had a conversation with Dana Van in the assessor's office and similar to the conversation I had with him about multi-family housing in general last year, it's really clear that if there are more units in the building, the valuation goes up and the tax revenue goes up. So a three-family of the same size is going to have more value and therefore going to produce more tax revenue than a single family. What he can't predict, what the town manager can't predict, what nobody can really predict is what will the effect be on expenses? Most of our expenses don't increase as headcount increases, but there are notable exceptions and those notable exceptions are schools and trash collection and both of those are expensive items. So that is the best answer anybody can give you similar to MBTAC, is that there's going to be some effect but there's no way to calculate whether or not we're going to be at a tax advantage or we're going to be neutral or we're going to be at a tax disadvantage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. And then Ken had expressed an interest in seeing how this would work. I think first of all the fact that we're allowing two family throughout Arlington. If you have a lot where floor plans and such wouldn't work for three-family. I think that there was a certain amount more flexibility but we did try to find kind of some examples of existing three-family units as well as kind of potentially how a larger single family could be adapted. I just have a couple pictures on the next few slides. But yeah, so 16 Water Street is an existing three-family unit. So I think it's eight bedrooms kind of can be done in keeping. And again, you'll note this with the two and a half story. Like third floor is just a half story. So it's kind of possible to do it without a full third story. The next one, 9 Russell Terrace. Yeah, I mean I guess one of the questions with all these is sort of whether you can do it within the existing setback. I mean this is a little bit short, but again, it's very much in keeping with the neighborhood. I biked by it a million times without realizing it was a three-family house. And finally, 5 Old Ham Terrace, Old Ham Road. That this is a larger single family that it would be possible in a kind of a larger lot and with a larger building to to do three separate dwelling units in a harmonious manner that matches the neighborhood. So yes, then we have a plan for public engagement that we've been trying to wait to get the guidance at the bottom of the vote before we go and tell everyone this is happening for sure. But as soon as we get the word, we'll be doing early outreach to all town meeting members. We're trying to send a newspaper coordinating an event that's open to the public. We'll also make sure that we've got coverage for attending all the different precinct meetings to hear resident concerns and to represent what the article is about. And I mean, I guess I would just say overall, too, like we would love to hear your concerns with the article and how it should be drafted. And even if it's not something that you kind of support currently, we would love to hear either what changes the language or what kind of process around this would make it something you can support in the future.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate you showing some examples of what you think the buildings will look like following stay within the setbacks. So the examples you've shown meet all the setback requirements. They're not existing non-conforming. So those buildings are meeting all the setbacks and all all size ramifications and those are three families right now. That's much appreciated. With the exception of 5 Oldham, which is just an 8,000 square foot single family, I think you just showed that example as this could easily be modified. This one here? Yeah, this one without really noticing that it was a three-family structure. Because it certainly has a floor plate to do it and already has a three-car garage that's around the side. It's a big mansion, basically. Yeah, well, it's one of, I could have pulled 10 of these, but it seemed like pulling real three families was a better idea. No, I agree with you. To be honest, I'm a little hesitant right now, okay, just because MBA communities just passed or will pass Christmas. But I just want to see how that develops. And the fact that there has not been very much public engagement and I realize you acknowledge the fact that you're waiting. I think we should have that because when you're doing MBTA communities, there was quite a bit of public engagement. Heated, yes, but there was a lot of it, okay? And I think that will help craft this thing. And so that's my little reservation saying that if there was, I would just wait and if you guys could wait because you guys only have a decision. Is this going to be a super majority or just a majority right now, right? And I would just wait, see what that decision is and then start your public engagement and see how that, with the public engagement, how that alters what you plan here. And it may enrich it. I think it will. Thank you, Ken.</blockquote>

Um so so one of the things that I noticed was the description of R0 and R1 talked about discouraging intensive land use and um I'm hearing the ear, uh, and so I'm wondering, I'm wondering if uh, that is that is something that would need to be revised with this, if going to a three-family house would be considered an intensive land use. Um another question I had was where the physical overlap with MBTA communities neighborhood districts are. I think that might have an interesting impact on on unit count. on magnitude of unit count, are we talking about the 50 units a year that MBTA communities estimated plus 72 units, or is it 50 plus 20? And then I would echo, can the public outreach or lack thereof, I think, is going to be very important. So those are my three thoughts. Thank you, Shana. Gene.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks. And thanks for bringing this to us so we can discuss it. I'm going to ask a couple questions about your analysis of the results, then go through some pieces of your draft and ask some questions about it, and then give an overall thought about it. So on the results, you indicate that if nothing happens in 10 years, 560 parcels will get redeveloped. But if this goes into effect, there will be 726 additional. So can you go to the results page? Next. Back one. Sorry. Back one. Back one. Back one? The summary of the results. That one. Thank you. 726 units. That's unclear wording, basically. So in all of the stuff, so this slide and the previous slide, I'm referring to additional incremental units. The stuff where it's saying additional per year. On top of the 506. No. So if you actually go back to the, these figures are just taken from the previous one. So the first line, total redeveloped parcels, that means parcels that were redeveloped due to this change and that we're assuming move from R0 or R1 to, or that move from single family to two or three. Okay, so if these are just those, even if the 560 all became two families, help me with the math, 1,120, so how do you get to 726? So if a single family becomes a three family, for example, then one parcel could become two dwelling units in that sense. In the vein of MBTA communities. This is the new units only created. So a single family is one. So, you know, 560, if they were all two families, the number would be 560 new dwelling units, and you're assuming that a certain amount are three families, so they're adding two instead of one. So this is on top of? The single family that already exists. Okay, thank you. I found this confusing. And that just might be me and not you. It's helpful to talk through it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate it. It's interesting. There was a report that came out I think the end of last year looking at Minneapolis. And, as you know, Minneapolis got rid of single family zoning. And the report basically said getting rid of single family zoning had almost no impact in Minneapolis. And all of the increased housing was sort of exactly what we did with MBTA communities on the main thoroughfare larger and not just getting rid of single family zoning. So, on the one hand, your numbers may be too high if we are similar to Minneapolis. On the other hand, if we're similar to Minneapolis, this may not really be necessary to do at all. So I'm mixed about what to do about that. I agree with Shana. If you're going to do this, you need to rewrite the R0, R1, and R2 definitions as opposed to just crossing out a few little things about them.</blockquote>

And pretty similar with R2. So I'd say you could do better in rewriting these three.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go to the next one. I like the idea if this is going to go forward with site plan review. My suggestion is rather than put an asterisk because there are too many asterisks already, just create a new thing, SPR, and then you put SPR in and then add SPR to the table where it says what each of these things are. Then you don't have to have one asterisk, two asterisks, or five asterisks. It's just, I think, a cleaner way of dealing with that. One of the things when you came a few weeks ago that I mentioned, and I'm still interested in it, I spoke to a couple of people and said, what do you think about this idea that you're proposing? And they said, I'd feel better about it if they all looked like single family homes. So I wonder about the utility of putting something in here that says they have to resemble single family homes. So I'd like you to think about that also. And now we're getting to where Ken was, which is what I said last time. I just wonder whether this is premature, in that we haven't even implemented MBTA communities yet. We're not going to see what that looks like for another year or two. Maybe it makes sense to wait and see what is the development in the neighborhood district. Would that influence what this looks like? So I think it might be worth not saying no, never to this, but making some changes and waiting to see what happens in the next couple of years with MBTA communities and whether this makes sense under those circumstances. So that's where I am at the moment. Thank you, Gene. Steve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I'd like to express some appreciation for what I felt was a good effort towards answering all of the questions that we asked you the last time. I appreciate that. Just as a note regarding the variability between the runs, I see why you ended up that way because there's a lot less variability in what this would allow versus what the range of parcels under MBTA communities would allow. So that totally makes sense. The one substantive suggestion I would make is that site plan review would not be required for Two-Family. And I believe if I remember the discussion, the previous discussion, it went something to the effect of, well, we're requiring site plan review for Multi-Family in the MBTA district, so it would make sense for Three-Family, so it would make sense for Multi-Family elsewhere. So I would ask you to consider removing the requirement for Two but keeping the one for Three. I agree. I forgot to mention that. One other thing I forgot. Please, go for it. This is your big opportunity to change Three-Family dwelling to a Y in the R3 district, and you didn't do it. Well, we totally would have made that change. We appreciated that input.

The one thing I think might be helpful in terms of giving people an idea of how much it would change things is if there were some way to analyze how many houses, how many current Single-Family or Two-Family houses actually go all the way to the limit they're allowed to according to the setbacks versus how many they actually have some logo room. Because I think depending on what those numbers are, that might give us a better idea of whether there's likely to be a bunch of development or if it will be more of a Minneapolis situation. Great.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Carl Wagner - 398</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl Wagner, 30 Edge Hill Road, and a town meeting member. This article looks similar to the article that proposed getting rid of Single-Family zoning a couple of years ago. I'm distressed to see that it's back so soon. At the time, the proposal to get rid of Single-Family, and this would get rid of Two-Family zoning by adding three in both cases, was saying ostensibly that it would improve affordability, it would help our green efforts, our climate resiliency, and it would add to diversity. In town meeting, it was shown that it would do none of those things, and this would probably do none of those things also. Green, trees, open permeable spaces are lost to a desperate effort to get cars or vehicles any place they can be, front yard, side yard, back yard. We would see the loss in affordability. As you probably know, in all cases when Single-Families were turned into Two-Families, where they were allowed in Arlington, the individual unit price of the two units was more individually than the Single-Family that was knocked down to do that. We care about affordability for diverse people, for people who are coming in and looking for the affordable solution for them. And diverse people are not looking to pay more for one of a three-decker than they would for a Single-Family. Let's also talk about choice. Housing choice was the name of a recent bill that the old governor put in place. They should have a choice, we should have a choice to stay in Arlington as we move from multi-units, big buildings, to two units like condos, and then to Single-Families potentially. People want two and one-family units, and they want to keep their kids in the same town if they can. As they change their income or as they get married, they might be able to afford two-family or a one-family. They might be able to just move directly to those. We owe it to Arlington not to put radical choices out so quickly after MBTA Communities. We owe it to at least have a vote on such a major change, and especially before we get rid of the diversity of housing stock, the affordability, and the green efforts that we're already making to keep our open spaces open. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else wishing to speak on this item? Please.</blockquote>

No, I just want to echo what he has just said, much like I did on the last article. I thought it was just last year we discussed the removal of the R1 zone in town, and not a couple of years ago, and as the board has already mentioned a number of times, this is falling very quickly on the heels of that before we have the chance to even see what happens with what we did last year, which was radical change for the town. A lot of people think it went the right way. A lot of people think it went the wrong way, but be that as it may, I think this is premature. I think it's tone deaf considering the discourse that we had last year so recently to come back and do this so quickly. Again, I'm not sure why that's occurring. Again, I use the term safe harbor. I think we need hands-off for this for a couple years to see what happens, and I think the board should consider that in any position they take. Thank you.</blockquote>

I do agree with the idea that, well, we just did MBTA communities, so maybe we'll want to wait a year or two. But I do love the idea of being able to make these regular-sized houses into two and three families. We're already tearing down small houses and building big mansions in Arlington, and it's maddening to see that this is for one family. It's happening anyway. We don't seem to be able to stop it. And so we might as well give developers the opportunity to make a home for three families in one of these monstrosity, well, I'm not going to say monstrosity, but large homes rather than one. So I think it's a great idea. I do worry about is this going to mean more paving over for driveways, but there may be something that can be done about that. Maybe there's permeable pavement. Maybe there's a limitation on pavement. I don't know. I think it's definitely worth it. Or maybe just have dirt driveways. How about that for an idea of gravel? So I think it's definitely an exciting idea. I don't think it can happen too soon. This is a very different attitude than I had when the two-family buy-write came up a few years ago. I was like, oh, no, it's paved over and everything. But I see what's happening, and I think it's a great solution to providing more housing. Yeah. So thank you. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant Cook, Precinct 16. You mentioned the Minneapolis situation of eliminating single-family zoning, and you were right. They said that single-family change wasn't that much of the impact. What was an impact was eliminating parking minimums, which was something you all fought to keep in the MBTA discussion. And I think at some point you said you would deal with it. So I guess I'm looking forward to you actually dealing with it. I mean, I assume not this year, but it is something that had a great impact in Minneapolis, and I hope that's something you guys take seriously when you said you would address it as a consideration. The larger buildings. Yeah. So, I mean, yeah. I don't know the details of Minneapolis, but the impact for eliminating parking minimums was the biggest thing we felt. And, yeah, I mean, we have to argue with this change versus the status quo. There was a small house that went on sale in the center, single-family on a postage-sized piece of land. I think half the house didn't have heat, and it priced at $800,000. I mean, that's for a single family that's going to need significant work. That's the status quo. Now, do we change this now? I don't know. But the status quo is pretty bad. So I hope we act steadily to improve things. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments?</blockquote>

I would just like to say that I would feel way better about this if there was a safe way to present this that would garner a two-thirds majority. If you could make a persuasive enough case, if a case could be made for a two-thirds majority that would convince a two-thirds majority, I would feel, like, way better about something like this than if the system is sort of kind of being gamed to play the 50% majority thing. That's all. Thank you. Yes. Wendy Richter, Brattle Place. I am an affordable housing advocate, and I feel that this particular proposal will not feed into increased affordability. I see that from a couple of different angles. I think that perhaps if existing houses were allowed to be turned into multifamily and there was a process to do that, that would be not what this proposal is. But if there were a process for that, I could see that providing some affordability. I'm an architect, and I know what developers do in terms of you take a property. Land is very expensive here, and you maximize it, and you make the biggest units you can. And I see that as building out lots. And if you go to the R1 and 2, building out those lots for three families, you're going to end up with very expensive three-family units. I think the idea of being able to have the houses still appear as single families, but that doesn't usually happen when it comes down to design because people want their own front door. They want their own house. I think that if you're converting an existing single family that's large, it's going to look really different than a new building That is built on a lot that maximizes the footprint and minimizes the open space.

I'd like to differ from some of the members of the board that this is too soon to the MBTA communities Because I think we don't need to limit ourselves and give a quota of only one change or one bylaw change every five years or so if that benefits the town We don't need to limit ourselves from doing something that will benefit the town And two, more importantly, I think we need to use all levers possible. MBTA community was one level. We need to use all levers possible to A, resolve the housing crunch, but B, more importantly, to better the town's finances. This is very, very good for town's finances Three units of 1,000 square feet produce more property taxes than one unit of 3,000 square feet. So we need to remember that So three units of 1,000 square feet produce more property taxes than one unit of 3,000 square feet Two, renovations and changes obviously will not be subject to prop 2.5 and that will be added to new growth So this is very beneficial for town's finances, which by the way have been struggling The town was paying 4% of the median household income 15 years ago as property taxes Now we pay 7% of the median household income as property taxes The reason why we ended up there is because we don't have new growth So this is very, very beneficial for the town's finances So we shouldn't stop ourselves from using all levers to improve town's finances and also resolve housing crunch Another reason why this is important, why we should do this, is because this actually opens up housing choice rather than curtailing housing choice Another number I would like to give is the average household size in Arlington in the last 50 years has reduced from 3.3 to 2.2 or so So just back in 1970 U.S. Census, an average household in Arlington had around 3.2 members Now it's only 2.2, so household sizes have reduced Which means we need more households to house the same amount of people, which we haven't been doing So people out there in the market want, for the reduced household, they want more units, multifamily units And we need to respond to that as well And as a result of that, the town's population has reduced from 54,000 in 1970 to just 46,000 now That's a 13% decrease in the town's population While the commonwealth's population has increased 24% So we haven't produced enough houses, and as a result our population has reduced, and the town's finances have also reduced So what I'm saying as a summary is that just because we did something last year in MBTA communities Shouldn't stop us from doing something else that will be beneficial for this town, for all of the current residents And town finances, and in the process, help house prices Thank you</blockquote>

Well, okay, I'm going to stand up because I don't talk very loud unless I stand up So I would like to say That in terms of the question of it being too soon to bring an article You know, we're fully aware that it can be bruising on town meeting We're both town meeting members We went through that bruising Well, I am, and we're going to be soon, JP So get used to it And so hence our concern about fighting for a two-thirds vote And I think from the feedback that we've heard from the board tonight It feels like maybe we need to do some more cooking And maybe we need to do some more public engagements and so forth So I'm not going to be surprised when you take your vote One way or the other And I'm not going to be upset about it But what I would like to add is Some thoughts about this question of community impact and affordability Okay, so no, this is not an article about affordable housing I worked for YouthBuild for four years I worked for the Housing Partnership Network for four years I've built with Habitat for Humanity for 20 years And I have many, many clients in my current information systems practice That are affordable housing organizations I know what affordable housing is That's not what this is about This is about production and filtering Yes, somebody can buy a little house across the street from me For $800,000 They're not going to do that The next house across the street from me that gets bought A nice little six room ranch Is going to be bought by a developer for $800,000 And they're going to build another 5,000 square foot house That's going to house one family And going to sell for more than $2 million Instead of two or three units That might sell for $800,000 or $1 million a piece That is more affordable Than what is being produced in my neighborhood People talk about the changing the character of the town If you lived in my neighborhood You would have seen what changing the character of a neighborhood means In the last 10 years My neighborhood doesn't look anything like the neighborhood I moved into Because there are conforming locks all around me And every time a house turns over It gets knocked down and turned into Four 5,000 square foot houses And that's fine They're just saying there should be an option For more units and therefore more families And the families that can afford a million dollar house That can't buy in Arlington Because the price is $2 million They're looking for where they can afford And in some of the places they're buying They're buying houses that are more affordable And maybe they're renovating themselves But those are houses in neighborhoods Where somebody's being displaced So the idea is That if we produce more housing here Yes, expensive housing, but more housing here And less displacement happens in other places Where housing is naturally affordable It's a regional system So that's the effect on equity In terms of the environmental effect Claire, if you would back up the picture of 5 Old Ham Road If you'll indulge me Rachel, I appreciate your Let me go back to the slides That house was built on a woodlot And it was built on a woodlot And next to it was a small house That at the same time, same developer Was turned into two large colonials And then there's the colonial that had always been there And then up the hill from that Are two more large houses built on woodlots So this doesn't preserve the environment What preserves the environment What makes this look lovely And means it has green space around it And trees and so on and so forth Is the thing we're not changing Which is the dimensional requirements And the setbacks I fail to understand Why it's more of an environmental impact If there are three families living in that building Instead of one And I hope I'm not being insulting to the folks Who live at 5 Old Ham Road I'm sure they're lovely people So that is the point Is give more people more choices Allow for a greater variety of housing stock in town And make it easier for people Who currently couldn't buy a house here To buy a house here So they're not buying a decrepit single family In Mattapan And renovating it And gentrifying yet another neighborhood That's displacing people who've lived there for generations But have never been able to afford to buy a house Thank you</blockquote>
