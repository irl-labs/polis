> We'll now move to agenda item number two, the third night of the hearing for the Warren Articles for Fall 2023 Special Town Meeting. This evening is reserved for the deliberation of the Board and a vote on whether to recommend action or no action on the articles which are before us as per the agenda. We will move first to Article 12, the MBTA Communities Overlay District. And I will hand it over to Claire to run through the revisions that have been incorporated into the documents that have been posted and the additional study items that were prepared by UTL.

<details><summary>Article 12 - MBTA Communitiess Overlay District</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 1327</summary>

> Great. Thank you. The Department of Planning and Community Development, the MBTA Communities Working Group, and UTL, our consultant, are returning tonight with the information requested by the Board at their meeting on September the 11th. What you will see tonight are nine different scenarios and two alternatives for the district, most of which are related to maximum height and parking requirements, although there are three alternatives that would change the overall shape of the district, two of which are alternatives for Arlington Heights, and two in East Arlington that were proposed for study by this Board on 9-11. So I'm going to run through the various scenarios and then look at and discuss the decision points for this Board this evening. Alternative 1 stretches from East Arlington to the Lexington town line. This alternative avoids the future zoning study area for an Arlington Heights business district. Alternative 1 and Alternative 2 avoid all commercial and industrial parcels and limit the depth of the neighborhood multifamily district to approximately 150 feet from the main thoroughfares on Mass Ave and Broadway in East Arlington, allowing for a one-to-two parcel transitional height area of four stories into the R1 and R2 districts. While Arlington Heights, in order to maintain the future zoning study area for the business district, the overall depth of the neighborhood multifamily district from the center line of Mass Ave is 350 feet. The model outputs for Alternative 1 are the district area is approximately 109 acres with a capacity for 7,268 units at a density of 67 dwelling units per acre with a parking maximum of one space per unit. Alternative 2 in East Arlington is the same as Alternative 1. However, in Arlington Heights, we don't zone to the town line. Rather, we extend the neighborhood multifamily district to the north of Mass Ave. We include Grove Street and the Forest Clark Pierce Street area. This is a more granular and zoomed-in look. The model outputs for Alternative 2 are slightly different from Alternative 1 with a district area of about 115 acres at a capacity of 7,391 units and a density of 65 dwelling units per acre, again, with a parking maximum of one space per unit. Here is a comparison of those two alternatives for compliance with the MBTA communities. October 2nd, this evening's scenario for discussion and deliberation. Again, at the meeting on 9-11, this board asked the Department of Planning and Community Development and the working group to go back and model the following alternatives as on the slide. Model the neighborhood multifamily zone with a three-story height maximum instead of four. Model a minimum parking requirement of one space per unit instead of a parking maximum requirement of one space per unit. Model a zone that eliminates the proposed overlay east of Orvis Road directly on Mass Ave., but retrains the neighborhood multifamily area to maintain contiguity. Model a zone that eliminated all proposed overlay parcels east of Orvis Road along Mass Ave., including the neighborhood multifamily area. Scenario 1, three stories in the neighborhood multifamily district. This simply changes the height maximum from four to three stories in the overlay area, and we end up with a district area, again, of 115 acres with a capacity for 6,330 units at a density of roughly 55 units per acre. The next scenario is three stories across the neighborhood multifamily zone with one parking space, one minimum parking space per unit. So we stay at three stories, and we add the minimum of one space per unit. We model the district, again, at 115 acres with a capacity of 3,351 units at a density of roughly 29 units an acre. In this scenario, we are modeling four stories with the one space parking minimum. With four stories across the neighborhood multifamily and a parking minimum of one space per unit, again, the district area is 115 acres with a capacity of 3,939 units at a density of roughly 34 units per acre. All right. Scenario 3A, to remove all the parcels on Mass Ave. east of Orvis Road while keeping neighborhood multifamily with a maximum height of four stories. By removing the parcels along Mass Ave. east of Orvis Road in anticipation of a future ARB zoning study and leaving enough of the neighborhood multifamily zone to maintain We model a district acre, about 130, excuse me, 113 acres with a capacity of 7,137 units at a density of roughly 64 units per acre. This scenario models moving from four stories to three in the neighborhood multifamily zone with removing the parcels from Mass Ave. east of Orvis. By removing these parcels, we end up, oh, to maintain contiguity and requiring a maximum height of three stories instead of four, we model a district area of 113 acres at a capacity of 6,012 units and a density of roughly 54 units an acre. Scenario 3, we move from four stories to three in the neighborhood multifamily, remove Mass Ave. parcels and add one space, one parking space per unit minimum. By removing the parcels along Mass Ave. east of Orvis Road in anticipation of a future ARB zoning study and leaving enough of the neighborhood multifamily zone to maintain contiguity and requiring a maximum height of three stories instead of four and requiring a minimum of one parking space per unit, we model a district of roughly 113 acres at a capacity of 3,184 units and a density of 28.5 units per acre. Scenario B is to remove all parcels proposed east of Orvis Road. All right. We remove all parcels east of Orvis Road. The height maximum stays at four stories in the neighborhood multifamily area. By removing these parcels along Mass Ave. east of Orvis Road in anticipation of a future ARB zoning study, we model this district total at roughly 104 acres with a capacity of 6,570 units at 64.1 units per acre density. Scenario 3B2, remove all parcels east of Orvis Road with a height maximum moves from four stories to three stories. By removing the parcels along Mass Ave. east of Orvis Road in anticipation of a future ARB zoning study, we model a district area of 104 acres with a capacity of 5,594 units at 54.6 units per acre. Scenario 3B3, remove all parcels east of Orvis Road. Height maximum is at three stories instead of four with one parking space per unit minimum. The district area totals 104 acres with 2,966 unit capacity and a density of 29 units per acre. Historic properties. This is a map of historic properties in the zone, most of which are currently clustered across Mass Ave. from the high school but are necessary to include as a matter of contiguity as the parcels that front Mass Ave. in this area are commercially zoned. This chart tells us how many historic properties are in the zone and their level of distinction. Remember that some are identified at three different levels, National Register, State, Congress, Inventory, and Local Inventory. This chart tells us how many properties are in the zone and their level of distinction. Remember that historic properties will continue to be subject to design review, demolition delay, and that MBTA communities overlay does not include historic districts. So for our compliance check, we can leave this slide up for reference. It's basically a summary of everything I just went over. District size, capacity, and district density. Decision points for this evening. Three or four stories in the neighborhood multifamily. Orvis Road eliminates some or all parcels to the east in preparation for future study. Alternative one, which zones neighborhood multifamily to the Lexington town line along Paul Revere Road. Alternative two, which flips that neighborhood multifamily to the north of Mass Ave along Grove Street and Forest Clark and Pierce area. Also for consideration tonight are parking requirements and inclusion or disinclusion of historic properties. Thank you.

> Thank you. Sure. I'm happy to leave that slide up for discussion. Okay. So thank you, Claire. You're welcome. Gene, if you could, at this point, run through the alterations that you were able to make to the draft amendment, that would be helpful. And then we'll open it up for the board discussion. Yeah. As a result of our last... Yes, please. Sean, would you... Just one second. Sean, would you please be able to raise the volume on the microphones? Thank you. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 429</summary>

> As a result of our previous meeting, I did amendments to the Warrant Article 12 main motion. I'll just go through them briefly. I added four definitions, a definition of as of right development, which I pretty much took directly from the MBTA community's guidance, a definition of multifamily housing, which I took pretty much directly from the MBTA community's guidance, a definition of overlay district, which is an amalgam of a few different definitions in various places that is consistent with what's proposed for the MBTA overlay district, and a definition of site plan review, which is a combination of the definition in the compliance guidance plus the additional discussion in the compliance guidance about site plan review. I removed the definition of executive office of living and whatever it's called these days as unnecessary. In the district regulations part, I did some rewording. One substantive change I added is at the end of 5.9.1B, the sentence that says, I'm sorry, 5.9.1C, which says if a proposed development is located on a parcel or parcels only partially within the MBMF or MNF overlay districts, the provisions of the existing underlining zoning shall apply. For example, if there was a parcel in the neighborhood district and somebody added two other parcels to it, so it went all the way down the street, the question is, should it then be subject to the overlay district or should it be subject to the underlying district? We can change that. I figured I needed to put something in for the discussion, and I thought the better way to look at it was it should be subject to the underlying zoning, not the overlay district. And there were some other wording changes I made, 5.9.1, but no substantive change. In 5.9.3, I rewrote and made some editorial changes to site plan review, but no substantive changes. I didn't make any changes to the development standards other than some slight rewording. In the bonuses area, I did not make any changes either. And I rewrote the affordable housing section completely to do what I thought the board intended to do or the working group intended to do, which would be have the requirements the same as currently exist in the bylaw with the proviso that until they are approved by EOHLC, the EOHLC standard applies, which is required by the guidance. I didn't change the part in the bonuses about the bonuses for more units. I just clarified what the percentages were. So those are the changes to the previous version to this version.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 115</summary>

> Great. Thank you, Gene. So we have a number of items that we had identified that we need to run through this evening to ensure that we come to consensus from the board on the open items from the September 11th hearing. And so I'd like to start by, Gene, having you run through the items that you would like to put on the table for discussion this evening. I'll run through each of the board members, and then we will take those one by one. Actually printed. So we will read this out to ensure that this is part of the record. Gene, your intent is to read through this, correct? Perfect. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 1182</summary>

> Okay. I have so many that I thought it made sense to print them out so everybody could see them with me. Let's get going. So Article 12, the three issues that Rachel and I had discussed previously were reducing the neighborhood district maximum height to three stories, applying the current off-street parking requirements of Section 6.1 to the MBTA overlay rather than the proposed no minimum, one max, and the other proposed changes. And Gene, just before you go, that includes the potential for parking reduction for those correct?  Right. Okay. Great. And so we could reduce them with the Transportation Demand Management Plan. For 6.1.5. Right. And excluding Mass Ave. from Orvis to Ellewife Brook Parkway from the overlay, as is one of the scenarios which were discussed. There are the other suggestions. Adding a street trees requirement, which we said would be in this but isn't currently in it. I think the easiest way to do that is to make it subject to the Zoning By-law Section 6.3, which we intend to ask the town meeting to amend to include residences. Including the solar roof requirements, I think only for the Massachusetts Avenue and Broadway Multifamily District. Make those subject to the Zoning By-law Section 6.4. We need to do something with signs because the sign by-law applies to either business districts or residential districts. And the way this overlay is written, it's neither a business district nor a residential district. So, we, therefore, have to apply the sign by-law, and my suggestion is for the neighborhood multifamily district to apply the residential sign district requirements. For residential in the Massachusetts and Broadway multifamily district to apply the residential slash business sign district. And for those buildings that use the bonus to create mixed use, they would get the business sign district requirements. Next, which we discussed a few weeks ago, is changing what's currently site certifiable to sites gold or better certified or other standard the ARB may adopt in its rules and regulations. David Morgan, in his memo, suggested gold certifiable, but I think some of us think certifiable is too loose to work with and not enough to get an extra floor. To the purpose statements, adding one other purpose, to encourage environmental and climate protection sensitive development. I removed some duplicate requirements. I would remove some duplicate requirements and those that don't seem to make a lot of sense in context. For example, in 5.9.5E, E5, sorry, E4, it talks about height with bonuses cannot exceed four stories in the NMF district, but there are no bonuses in the MMS district. So it really doesn't make sense to keep that in there. Another change is if you look at 5.9.410, it's almost exactly the same as the chart in 12 and the bonuses. So I would get rid of it except to move the sentence that says minimum required front setback areas shall be available for uses such as trees, landscaping, benches, tables, chairs, play areas, or similar features to a note on the district chart. Next, adding some additional requirements for ground floor first level to qualify for no front yard setback and extra stories height. Some of you may have seen the letter we got late today from the Chamber of Commerce suggesting that 68% is too low, a percentage. 60%? Yeah. Thank you. And they didn't suggest a percentage and I don't know what it could be. The other ones I would suggest in order to get the front yard, no front yard setback and extra stories height is no residences on the first floor. And the other is it must be retail, restaurant, not because I don't see why we would give away a setback for offices, for example. So when you think about how we want to activate the streetscape and the pedestrians, they're for retail, they're for restaurant, maybe for some service businesses, but not for office. So I think we need to do something about that. I think we need to rethink what to do with a parcel, partially in the MBMF and partially in the NMF. Right now it says when it's in both, the MBMF applies, but you can think of a scenario where there's a parcel in, let's say on Mass Ave., and they combine it for a few parcels going down the side street, and under this they could then build six story buildings going down the side street. And I don't think that was the intention. So I would flip this around and say if it's partially in the MBMF and partially in the NMF, the NMF rather than the MBMF applies. Then there are some wording changes. So for example, in the chart for height, front setback, rear setback, yard setback, we need to add minimum to the setback numbers, because right now it's not clear if they're max minimum or whatever. We should probably put the word yard in. And then there was a suggestion we got from one of the comments that said for the side setbacks, maybe what we want to do instead is say one side minimum 5 feet and two sides minimum 20 feet to give a little bit more flexibility for that. On stepbacks, which is now in 5.9.4D7, I would remove that and just do a subject to the setbacks that now exist. We're going to make some changes to those, but I think it doesn't make any sense to me to have different setbacks for those within and outside the overlay since the buildings might be right next to each other on Mass Ave. or Broadway. 5.9.4D5, which is the traffic visibility across street corners, right now it does not apply in the MB. It does not apply at all if you read the details because it's in residential districts, and there are no residential districts in the overlay if you rely on the overlay. So I would rewrite it instead to say traffic visibility across street corners applies in the NMF districts rather than how it's written. Then in 5.9.3, we just need to capitalize the word section and add 5.9. I forgot to do that when I rewrote that part. The height buffer area, so right now we don't technically need this here because the height buffer area does not apply to anything in the overlay district because the height buffer area only applies when you look at the tables and there are two different heights, but there are no two different heights in the tables in the overlay district. So it doesn't apply. However, I think it should apply. I think it should apply until we decide what we want to do with the height buffer area and go to town meeting and see if they agree because it does serve a purpose. I think all of us think it needs to be amended, but I don't want to do away with it at all. What else do I have? That's it. That's a lot, but that's what I have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 104</summary>

> Great. Thank you, Jean. Before we go further, I would just like some clarification from Claire and perhaps the working group. Jean made a couple of references to the fact that the business and residential districts are replaced by this overlay district. My understanding from reading this is that it doesn't replace it, but these are superimposed over it and the business and residential requirements still remain. So some of the items that you were just referring to as needing to add back in, my understanding would still apply because they are still in the underlying zoning. Am I misinterpreting what you're saying, Jean?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 126</summary>

> That's not how I read this. The way I read it was this overlay district goes over the residential and business, and you have a choice of either complying with the rules of the underlying residential or zoning district or complying with the rules of the overlay. That's what this said initially. So when I made some minor wording changes, I did not change the substance, so it still says you can comply with either. So that means that if you choose to comply with the overlay, you don't comply with anything that's specifically for the residential and business. So for example, a lot of 5.3.1, I think, says in any district. So those apply to any district. So if you look at the zoning by-law...
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 32</summary>

> Before we go too deep, can I ask the members of the working group, was that the intent or was the intent that the underlying zoning applies unless altered by the overlay?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak and Rachel Zsembery - 314</summary>

> My recollection, Madam Chair, was that the underlying, it was a pick one or the other. So where the overlay is silent, we need to make sure that the overlay is not silent on any of these items. So I can say, so there are some parts of the by-law currently that apply to everything. So for example, 5.2.1 says all districts, this is how it works. But then there are other parts that only apply to residential, other parts that only apply to business. I was too simple in my answer. So I think in members of the working group, if I'll look at you, was that in the case of where the overlay had one set of rules and the underlying district had a different set of rules, dimensional tables, for example, then it would be picking one or the other. But you know- It would be if you are, it would be the overlay district, again, if you are looking to create multifamily housing. Correct. But for example, if for things that, you know, for things that are not- There would- For things like signage, for example. For things like signage, yeah. We would not need to specifically apply that because again, this does not replace the existing zoning. Right. It is superimposed over top of it. Correct. So that was the intent. That's not, well, that might have been the intent, but that's not how it reads. We should talk about that. I'm going to put that on the list because I read that, I'm reading that it reads that way right now. And let's say that that's the way it reads. Let's use Saansen as an example. The underlying district in all of these is residential. So if you put a six-story multi-use, I don't think you want to use the residential sign rules. Understood. Right?  So, yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau? - 154</summary>

> Can I say something? Yes. I agree with Steve and probably Rachel that the intent of the working group was that this is just simply makes it as a right and not as a special permit to build these projects. And so it just made it easier to build more residential. If this overlay is silent, example signage and whatever, then underlying rules still apply. And that's, we never was there to enforce or change signage or egress or anything like that. It just made it more convenient in encouraged housing that way there. You know, we got into this other affordable stuff and this other stuff is a byproduct of what people wanted in town. But the underlying thing when we first started was to make it easier to develop housing in this community. And that's how I interpret it. So I think I'm saying the same thing that we just said, Steve.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 200</summary>

> Yeah. I mean, I think in terms of drafting, the goal was to be very specific about what did not apply. Right. And most of the things in development standards that you say did not apply with one or two exceptions are the ones that apply regardless of the districts it's in. So it remains, I don't think it's ambiguous, but apparently it is ambiguous as to whether the underlying applies unless it's changed by this or whether if you choose the overlay, you don't deal with the underlying at all. And it does present some of the problems because there are some things that we want to apply such as I'd say street trees, solar, things like that, that aren't necessarily in those districts but only happen or parking where we can change it when it's subject to environmental design review. So it becomes pretty complicated to figure out what to do if the underlying applies unless it's modified by the overlay. It's a lot easier if you say if it's in the overlay, the underlying doesn't apply. And then we just add in the things that we want to apply. I see somebody shaking his head over here.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 92</summary>

> Yeah. So that's not how I was reading and that's not how I've been looking at this and I think it's pretty clear in Section 5.9.1B where it talks about it not replacing the underlying districts but it's superimposing that these items, again, where it's silent, we need to apply the standards that are currently in the bylaws. We can run through and see how many of those. We can certainly put something in 5.9.1 to clarify. I think we need to. If we're confused, then we absolutely need to do that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 63</summary>

> Right. Okay. All right. So that's Gene's list. But what we put in is saying that the underlying regulations stay unless it is changed. That's what we need to talk about. So I'm just making a list of all the different things. Yes, you're right. That's what we need to discuss this evening. So Ken, did you have other items on your list?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 157</summary>

> I did talk, I wanted to talk about one thing, which is how we turn the corner on the setbacks. Not necessarily the, no, sorry. How we turn the corner on the stepbacks, not the setbacks. Okay. All right. And something we had talked about before, so I'd like to put that on the table to talk about how that, when you, Sorry, setbacks or stepbacks?  Step? Step. Stepbacks. Okay. Stepbacks. Yep. So when you turn the corner, you might have a six-story building, and as you turn the corner into a more residential street, it would step back to blend in more with, on side streets. I'd like to put that on, and then a couple of things that I'd like to talk about with Gene, but you want a table that's going over some of this? Yes. We'll go through each one of these point by point. Okay. That's all I wanted to add.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 25</summary>

> Okay. Gene had a pretty good list here. Great. Thank you. Steve, any other points that you'd like to put on the table for discussion?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 72</summary>

> I'd like to say, yes, for bonuses, subsection E1, we, an earlier version of this, I believe, set the, it said that the allowed, set of allowed commercial uses for ground floor commercial would be B2, and I'm not seeing any, I'm not seeing that mentioned in this revision, so I think we have to say which commercial uses are allowed on the ground floor. Which is sort of what I said.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 50</summary>

> Okay. Yeah, that's similar to what Gene was suggesting, that we should be explicit as to preferred commercial uses. Right. Yeah, because if, Steve, if you look at it, it says business uses, and that was the exact language in the previous version, which I felt was too loosey goosey.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 118</summary>

> Yeah, I was thinking, there was an earlier revision that was, I think it was uses allowed in B2, but, you know, we can come back to that. In E2, I believe there's a word missing, so second to last line, second additional may be added. I think the word story should be after additional. Right. I'm sorry, which, E2? E2, correct. And in section F, this is going to hinge upon parking, but I think F1 and F4, it doesn't make sense to have, those should be one or the other and not both. Right. And we'll have to iron that out. And that is, everything else, I believe, has been mentioned, so I'll wrap up there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 190</summary>

> Great. So we talked about parking reductions. Question I had under purposes, whether B and D were the same intent, and we should combine those together. B and E. B and D. B and D. Under 5.9.2. Should put that on the list, and let's see. You talked about 6.4 in the zoning by-law, ensuring that the solar by-law applies. And I have some suggested wording for adding more teeth to the green development bonus. Any others before we start running through these? Let's start with the top of the list. I think we're going to go from large concepts down to more details, which is great. That's probably a great place to start. So let's start with reducing the neighborhood multifamily requirements max height from four to three stories. That was put on the table by Gene. I'm personally in favor of reducing the height from four to three stories. I'm interested in what you think, architecturally, in terms of the context of the existing communities, and what I think, again, what we've been hearing from the public. But Steve and Ken, interested in your thoughts. You first, Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 216</summary>

> Thank you. I think when we had talked about this a lot in our working group, a lot of the neighborhoods are two and a half stories right now. So introducing a maximum height of three stories is not enough of an incentive to increase the housing. So I think having the fourth story is what makes the difference. Otherwise, this will just become a non-starter, saying if someone's going to buy a property that already has two and a half stories, they're just going to renovate it. The cost of adding that half story is not enough to develop it into a full increased number of units. They're just going to renovate it. They're not going to add units. And so I think we settled on four stories as a requirement. And if you do look at there's some areas, there are four-story buildings adjacent to in the neighborhoods. I'm not saying a lot because the zoning over the last few years has actually discouraged that, and we're trying to change it. That's what we're doing here now. And so I think it can be done. And I'm not saying let's put a six-story building there, but a four-story to two and a half-story building I think is reasonable. That's what the working group felt.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 169</summary>

> Okay? Steve?  Yeah, I went back and forth on this one for a while. I've been thinking about this one a lot. Originally my thought was, you know, it would be nice to have more buildings with elevators. And I see that now that it's a little more complicated than we originally assumed and there are a whole bunch of factors in play. I get my personal feeling is that although I like the idea of four-story buildings, I think there would be more people who would feel comfortable with this if it were three. And in terms of recalling my days on the Zoning Board of Appeals, there are a lot, I think the utility of going, there is utility in giving people the option to go from a two and a half to a three. There's, you know, we certainly have enough dormer requests, and, you know, they do what they can short of a third story. I'm okay with a three-story in the neighborhood multifamily.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 97</summary>

> Great. Thanks, Steve. Can I certainly hear what you're saying? I think my feeling is that there is, to Steve's point in terms of the adaption of a two and a half story to a three-story building and giving that an incentive to renovate from a two-family into a three or, you know, potentially four-family. But most likely a three-family is part of the intent of this is to have multifamily at many different scales. And three-family certainly seems to fit into the existing fabric of many of those neighborhoods very seamlessly. That's where I'm coming from.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 349</summary>

> Yeah. I mean, I agree with Steve and Rachel. I'll just add a couple of points. The compliance guideline itself says that the district should encourage a development of multifamily housing projects of a scale, density, and aesthetic that are compatible with existing surrounding uses. And, you know, I walked some of the streets, not all of them, but quite a few of the streets that just go off Mass Ave. and Broadway to see what they look like and what's there. And, you know, mostly it's two, two and a half, and three-story buildings. And I think the three-story, which if the overlay district doesn't replace everything else really allows three and a half story just the way two allows two and a half story, you get something that's in line with, you know, the scale, density, aesthetic that's there already. I'll point out that there was some discussion a while ago about whether four-story would be much preferable because it requires an elevator. And I did a lot of research, and my research turned up that the rules for elevators are the same for three-story buildings as four-story buildings, which basically is if you can have all the accessible pieces, you know, apartment, entrance, things like that, on the accessible ground floor, you don't need an elevator. Realistically, as buildings get taller, people are going to want to put in elevators because, you know, people don't want to walk up a lot of stairs. But the rules are the same for three- and four-story buildings as far as elevators. So I think that for the reasons you stated and also for many, many, many of the comments that we've gotten about this and the consideration of the changes in elevation, not in East Arlington so much as the center and west of the center. I just think three is a much better place to be than four. So in terms of coming to a consensus on this, it looks like, you know, three of us are leaning towards three. Is that something that you can get behind?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 313</summary>

> At this point in time, I want to ask, does this affect the one-story bonus for affordable? So you're saying three stories with the standard and then that's the maximum height you can go? The bonus isn't available in the neighborhood district, so it has no impact. I'm just asking right now because we're reducing it from four to three. Only in the neighborhood district. I realize that, but now we're saying, I'm asking if we were to do a more affordable unit, would the four-story come back? Would you guys get behind that? I'm just trying to get a compromise here. But there's no four-story building, there's no bonus in the neighborhood. No, Jean, Jean, I said, if I were to say, if I ever get behind reducing it to three stories on the neighborhood communities, okay, can we introduce then a bonus for having more affordable units by adding the four-story in that neighborhood, in the neighborhood business, just like we've done elsewhere. And would you guys get behind that? I'm just trying to reach a compromise here because I really think reducing down three stories, you're not going to induce or encourage that much more growth. And if it's not about encouraging growth, then I think you've got the mark there. That's what I'm trying to say. I personally think that, again, from what we've seen in terms of properties that are in a two-family district that are not two families, when they are available for redevelopment, the new owner taking the opportunity to add the additional unit, that I feel confident based on that history that we will see additional units and number of units created by allowing for multifamily and three stories in this district. That's my point of view, Jean. I agree. I agree as well. I'm not going to get behind this. That's okay. That's fine.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 48</summary>

> Okay. So right now we are looking towards reducing the max height to three stories. Apply the current off-street parking requirements of 6.1, including parking reductions as 6.1.5 instead of parking maximums. So that was put forth by Jean. Ken, do you want to respond to that one?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 16</summary>

> Essentially this is just changing a maximum to a minimum. Is that what you're saying, Jean?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 39</summary>

> Yes. And applying the other requirements of parking. So, you know, in site plan review, they could ask for a reduction based on a transportation demand management plan. Which is currently allowable for multifamily in addition to business districts.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 14</summary>

> Right. But now you're going back to almost like a special permit then, right?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 100</summary>

> No. Because it wasn't the whole thing. It was to eliminate that extra stress so it would encourage someone to openly develop something, more housing as opposed to, I don't know now. I have to not . . . It's still as of right development if they want, the same way they can get bonuses for more affordability and for, you know, first floor commercial, they can get less parking if they put in a transportation demand management plan that is appropriate. So it remains as of right development. It just gives them choices about what they want to do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 302</summary>

> I'm not sure. I just see that we're pushing for environmental and we're pushing solar, pushing trees. We want to help the environment. And then we turn around and say, no, we need more cars parking here. We want more traffic. I just see that both of these things are contradictory to the two things. And I'd rather not . . . I'd rather go all in and say, hey, we do care about the environment. And we're going to minimize the amount of parking so there will be less cars on the road. People say there's too many traffic now. So by having more cars on the road, you get that. But if you're saying the maximum you get, I think, you know . . . I mean, I think this is . . . That's what I'm thinking. If a developer or someone buying a piece of property says, okay, if we have no parking, we're not going to be able to sell units. They're not going to build the units. They're just going to . . . They're only going to build it if it makes sense, physical sense. So if we have . . . If they need one space parking per unit, then they'll build that one space. But if they don't, I think we should give them the ability to say, hey, you know, we're for the environment. The town's for the environment. Let's not build it. And it's near a MBTA bus stop or whatever. And we're doing all this green stuff. Let's do it. That's how I saw it. And that's how I believe how the working group saw it. Okay? And I'm just expressing that's what we . . . That was our opinion. Okay? And it is my opinion right now, too.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 222</summary>

> Great. Steve? This is another one where I've spent a lot of time going back and forth with myself. As far as policy goes, we cater a lot to single occupancy vehicles. We encourage them a lot. And it's one of the most unsustainable practices we partake in as a society. So I think the . . . My recollection of sort of where the working group was is that we would prefer people not build any more parking than absolutely necessary. And that's, you know, where the minimum of zero and the maximum of one came out from. In terms of going with a minimum of one and allowing for TDM reductions, I mean, that is consistent with the rest of the bylaw. It fits in. We kind of have a process for that. I think we might want to provide more residential-specific TDM options. A number of them are, you know, very much geared toward mixed use. But, you know, we should . . . I'd like to see TDM that, you know, doesn't leave the applicant asking, well, what's the third thing that I can do? You know, I could . . . I don't love the idea, but I could go along with it. I would also be happy with, you know, reducing the minimum to a half.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 238</summary>

> Understood. I agree with you, Steve. I've gone back and forth on this one a number of times in terms of the requirement. We . . . One of the things that I think is important to keep in mind is that we have not identified that there's any requirement for the parking to be specifically deeded or leased with the property. So with the minimum as of 1 . . . I mean, what we've seen come in front of us is typically no more than 1 and often for a reduction. So I think naturally we're seeing that occur. So by introducing a more progressive, to your point, Ken, policy with regard to supporting a lot of the climate-friendly policies that we have in town, that accepting a . . . I could probably go along with it with accepting . . . You know, the more I think about it, I could probably go along with accepting the parking, one-spot parking maximum, knowing that, again, it's not deeded or associated with any one unit, and there will be units that don't need parking and some that may need more than one, and that is not unlike the situations that we are regularly reviewing today when it comes to the mixed-use properties that come in front of us. So I've been really thinking about this one and trying to evolve my thinking on this one. Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 450</summary>

> Well, one other option to just toss it out. If we were to kind of keep the existing minimum of one space per dwelling, just basically keep existing what we have and then just go back and revisit parking generally, I think that is also a decent path forward. At Springtown meeting? Yeah, at Springtown meeting. So I'll mention a couple of things. MAPC did a report, Metro Boston Perfect Fit Parking Initiative, February 2017, and they did a survey in five communities, Arlington one, and in Arlington they looked at six apartment buildings and parking lots, and what they found was there was an excess of spaces compared to the number of cars. And partially as a result of that, we recommended and town meeting reduced the parking number to where it is now, which is a minimum of one. And if you look at the chart, which I have from that report, it says the average parking demand per unit in Arlington is 1.04. So just over one space per car. And they also did some data searching. Is the average number of vehicles per household? Now, this is 2017, so keep that in mind. But in owner occupied, 1.7 vehicles per household. Renters, one vehicle per household. That's all consistent with keeping it at one. I'll just add a couple of other things. They did a recent report in a lot of the Metro West communities, not Arlington, and they came up with one space per unit seems to be the appropriate number. Now, that included a lot of places that allow on-street overnight parking, which we do not. So I think compounding the need to have at least one space, I'd say one is the appropriate number per unit, is there is no overnight parking. I will just add that, you know, there's now a pilot going on piloting it. Why is the pilot going on? Because people want to have overnight parking because they don't have enough parking. And we got at least one very compelling letter, email from a couple, and they both need to drive to work, and they live in an apartment, and they drive in the opposite direction, and they're having a hard time. with two cars. And I think if we want to make sure that the units that get built are available to everyone, that also includes people who need cars. Whether they're older people who need cars, people with disabilities who need cars, or people who work places where they just can't hop on the bus or hop on a bike and get to work very often. I think we've been working with the one space per unit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 217</summary>

> I agree with Steve completely. We should write in some more transportation demand management plan ideas for residential property. We have talked about and allowed separating the units from the rental so people would have to pay more. Those sort of things. So I would keep it at one, not, you know. Minimum of one, is what you're saying. A maximum of one. A minimum of one, I'm sorry. A minimum of one. And allow us through site plan review to reduce that if they want to have it reduced. They don't have to have it reduced. And then we'll put in some transportation demand management pieces for that. Oh, sorry. Sorry, just a question for Gene. Are you suggesting that we, so we will need, that would need to be another item that is added to this section or a proposed change to the bylaw if we do want to add in more transportation demand options or per, you know, we'd have to work through those this evening, option one. Or option two, we would need to, we could decide to look at parking as a whole in either spring town meeting or depending on the time and availability for the studies that are needed, look at that either in fall or in spring of 2025.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 44</summary>

> I'd suggest saving it and amending the parking. Parking in general. Or at least amending the transportation demand management in general. In the spring. Rather than trying to figure out how to do that tonight. I agree. Or in the next day or two.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 257</summary>

> I'm gonna strongly disagree with that. Just because parking is the number one issue when it comes to developing multifamily housing. It takes up the most amount of square footage on the ground floor. It affects retail, affects just the housing in general. So by putting another burden on developing housing, you're essentially saying you're not encouraging housing by putting this thing on here, okay? I feel strongly that if one is a requirement, then they're gonna build one. If it's not required, then they're not gonna build it. And so we're following the, what we're trying to do is encourage housing. We're not trying to stagment it and control it. We're trying to encourage it. And I don't want to add all this extra rules and regulations or we'll look at this later. We're here to increase the ability to put more housing on because that's what is in crisis now. Now if we said, okay, let's, I think we're just delaying it. Kicking a can down the road. So I'd rather not delay it. I'd rather put it on there. I'm willing to compromise a little bit and say, let's say a half, which Steve said earlier. And I mean, this is all about compromise. I will go that way. A minimum of half and see where that goes. Because they're gonna build what they need to sell the units. They're not gonna say just because we said half, they're just gonna say, okay, well, we'll just build it that way. That's my counter. Steve.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 89</summary>

> Well, as I agree that we shouldn't try to amend TDM tonight. Like I said, I'm happy to go either with, I'm okay with going with a minimum of one or one half. I think the advantage of one is if some of these builders wanna come in and do less, we get a transportation demand. That is true. And I think that's a really valuable thing to get from them and to have them implement. And we lose that if we go with a lesser number or zero.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 436</summary>

> Can I offer another suggestion? Thanks. Perhaps. If we remain with the minimum of half of one, can we pair that with item four, rather than saying developments under this section may provide, developments under this section are encouraged to explore providing fewer parking spaces under the provisions of section 6.1.5. So that's F4. Yeah, and go after the. So we really, we push them through the wording of, we maintain the existing requirement of minimum of one space but pair it with developments are encouraged to explore providing fewer parking spaces under the provisions of 6.1.5. And if Jean or Steve, you have a better wording. I'm trying to, I totally understand what you're saying. And I'm trying to ensure that there is a way that we. But 6.1.5 is transportation management plan, right? I think we'd say encouraged to. That's geared for mixed use. It's not geared for all residential. There's not enough. Let me pull that up now. 6.1.5 includes shared parking. Which is peak demand. Offsite parking, transportation demand. At least three of these, charge for parking. So charging for parking onsite is one. Stipend for workers, preferential. Perhaps we add, I'm going to propose, a section D, which is to ensure that the spaces, we've often asked them to ensure that the parking is not associated with specific units. Again, whether that's deeded or associated with the lease. We could put in, we could amend this section to include D or add that here to the overlay to allow for them to meet the transportation demand as one of the options. To give them another option here. That has to do with separating it from the lease. I think giving them more options is good. It's just that most of the options there are meant for mixed use. I mean, shared is one that's shared between commercial and residential. Understood. Charging, yeah, okay, so you charge more money. But that's to decrease the number. Right. I think that the wording, developments under this section are encouraged to provide fewer parking spaces than required by section 6.1 makes sense. I think if we start saying, you know, putting other requirements on it here, it sort of raises the issue about whether we're going beyond what's in the underlying bylaw and raises some problem. So I like the idea of encouraged and revisiting the entire parking thing, including beefing up the transportation demand management in the spring. All right, because we do have nine, option C9 under 6.1.5, which is other means acceptable to the acceptable or to the applicable permit granting authority.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 121</summary>

> Well, you guys have the vote right now, so I'm just gonna, let's move on. I don't think we're gonna get to a mutual agreement here just because, I do feel strongly that, you know, we're trying to put in capture and put regulations on something that we're saying we're not doing regulations for. And I just, I think this is just one extra burden that as they come in, say, oh, well, these guys want to encourage housing, but now they got all these other rules. Then we just change one rules to another set of rules. And it's not like, here's what you can do and have at it. I don't know. I'm sorry. That's how I feel, okay?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 17</summary>

> No, I appreciate it. And I respect your feelings too, okay? I'm gonna leave it at that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 71</summary>

> Okay. So that I am clear between Steve and Jean, what we would look to amend this to look like, which would be applying the current off-street parking requirements of 6.1, including and combining under F one and four. So we'd have to fix F. Yeah. So that we edit that to include that developments under this section are encouraged to provide fewer parking spaces under the provisions of section 6.1.5.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 36</summary>

> And Madam Chair, because I don't think we've mentioned it specifically, the last sentence of F one states for business uses, no off-street parking is required for the non-residential space. I would like to keep that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 11</summary>

> Yes. Okay, good. Say that, I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 36</summary>

> So I am advocating that we retain the last section, the last sentence in F one that eliminates a off-street parking requirement for non-residential spaces. Which typically applies when the business is under 3,000 square feet.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 61</summary>

> Right. So I'm in agreement with keeping that. Are we limiting it to 3,000 or are we just doing no matter what this is? No matter what the business use is. I would agree, Steve, with that suggestion to keep that in. Me too. Okay. Gene, are you okay with keeping that one in? Sure. Okay. All right, that covers parking.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Overlay District Parcels</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 77</summary>

> The next is the, I'm looking at parts, we'll need an out of this. It's Orvis. Yes, we can go to that one next. Sorry, there was another one that I was gonna take for that, but that's okay, let's do Orvis and we'll come to the other one next. So excluding Mass Ave, the parcels that touch Mass Ave from Orvis to Alewife Brook Parkway. You wanna talk to that, why don't you take this one?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 213</summary>

> Sure. So in this proposal, again, much like Arlington Heights, we've spoken as a board about reviewing the East Arlington, business district to create some more continuity where currently there is discontinuity in the zoning. And one of the things that we discussed was identifying what we thought, much like we did in the Heights, what we thought the boundaries of that space that we would look at would be. And from Orvis Street to Alewife Brook appeared to be the majority of the business district in East Arlington. My feeling is that rezoning those parcels potentially twice in two years is a burden to the folks who own those parcels. And I'd prefer to do so at once. And when we look at this after the, you know, we've committed to doing that after we do the Arlington Heights business district overlay, that we incorporate that at that time. I'm appreciative of moving, again, the neighborhood parcels had been removed by the working group, I think, in order to spread out the impact across multiple parts of town. So I appreciate the study that included reintroducing those when the parcels along Mass Ave were eliminated in this study. So that's really the impetus for this particular request. And I'll go to Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 7</summary>

> I have no problems with this. Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 104</summary>

> So of the two options available, my preference would be scenario 3B. Let me pull those up. Scenario 3A, while I think it is a fine proposal, I don't know if, I'm not sure, I would at least like to want to talk about having a provision to allow for deeper business districts. And here it's, option A basically just removes everything fronting. Which means that we're, in a number of places, we're left with narrow parcels with no ability to aggregate behind. So whereas B gives us, I think, more flexibility to approach this in the future. So 3B would be my preference.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 102</summary>

> Gene? My preference is 3A3, which retains the parcels just off Mass Ave in the east. I hear what you're saying, Steve, but I think this is the area that's closest, you know, it's on the 77 bus line, and if they ever put in the so-called Better Bus Project, there'll be another bus going down that part of Mass Ave to Elle White Brook Parkway. And so I think keeping those in is consistent with walkable neighborhoods, and I just think it's a better way to do it. I think it spreads out the district more appropriately, more appropriately across town.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 140</summary>

> Sorry. Yeah, I mean, my thought was that looking at the business districts at a later point in time would also preclude, you know, changing the shape of the MBTA communities district at a later point in time as well. So I think it's still possible to do, I think you could do both without, you know, necessarily having to commit to one specific shape of the NMF in that area right now. Yeah, I mean, I think it's possible that we can, you know, suggest superimposing an overlay on Mass Ave after we're done with the rezoning, or we may not need to depending how we do the rezoning. But I don't know, I guess I just think it's a mistake to remove all the parcels east of Orvis from the zone. The neighborhood parcels. The neighborhood parcels, yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 17</summary>

> Kim? Do you have a preference between 3A and 3B, the neighborhood parcels being removed versus retained?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 167</summary>

> My first initial look at that was I was supporting 3B, removing all of it, just because if you can make tweaks and changes, just look at it holistically. If we just leave chunks here and there, you're gonna essentially handcuff yourself in making whatever you want along Mass Ave. And we agreed that we're gonna look at that and just look at it as a whole. But if we look at it now with this kind of zigzaggy thing there, you're handcuffing ourselves in the future to make whatever you want to make changes to. We still meet criteria by eliminating all of that. So I don't think the intent is still there. We're still trying to provide, encourage housing. It's just that we're just doing it in a smart way as opposed to saying let's have it here just because we want to. I'd rather look at it in a holistic way and say that's the way we should look at it. Sorry for rambling.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 81</summary>

> No, thank you. I will point out that there is a similar condition in the heights where we have bordering the boundaries of the business district, a neighborhood district. I think that that is slightly different because of the grade change in that area. But I do want to recognize that there is a similar condition in that section of Arlington along Mass Ave that we would be treating differently. I'd like to address that later when it comes up, yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 114</summary>

> Yes, and I think that would probably be a good, the next one that we should, because I don't think we had that one when Gene ran through his list. So I'll address that one next. But, and it's not just Paul Revere. It's actually the areas to the east of Park Ave directly behind the business district, where there is a similar condition to what we're looking at here in the east. The Gene, continuing the discussion around the parcels, the neighborhood district parcels, any response to what Ken and Steve just suggested in terms of their reasoning for one. to remove all of the neighborhood parcels at this time in the east?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 266</summary>

> I would have to think about that because I did not envision we were going to start zoning businesses off Mass Ave. into the residential neighborhoods. And I didn't envision that we would think about when we talked about rezoning the east part of Mass Ave. that we would think about extending the business districts into the residential neighborhoods. I feel like if we can get some more height on the buildings in along Mass Ave. and Broadway and more business things, we really don't need to go into the residential districts to add more businesses than we do now. And, you know, if you're going to do anywhere, you'd probably do it on Lake Street. And Lake Street already has businesses extending down a little bit off Mass Ave. So, you know, if we want to encourage more housing development, I'd prefer to keep the residential units in the overlay in East Arlington. So the, for me, the concern was mostly about the narrowness of the number of the parcels fronting Mass Ave. in East Arlington. Yeah, they are. You know, you can, of course, get a, you have at least the potential for a, you know, a higher value commercial building if you can go a little deeper. So could I suggest that that is only evident in a couple of parcels? Knowing that we need to agree on moving a plan forward tonight, would we be able to identify those which we might want to remove and deepen the parcels in other areas this evening? I think that for this small, please, Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 21</summary>

> I like your suggestion. Let's look at the heights and look at both of these in tandem. So let's table this?
</details></details>
<details><summary>Height Parcels - Paul Revere Road</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 65</summary>

> Yes. Yeah, that's fine. Let's do that. And we'll talk about East Arlington here along Mass Ave. and also the heights along Mass Ave. So we can look at it in both ways. Let's do that. At the same time. Okay, great. So let's now look at the two options that were presented for the heights. And Ken, did you want to speak to these?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 285</summary>

> I know that you had been discussing this as part of the working group. I think that, I think we were talking about scenario one and two at 2A, right? I think introducing three or four stories along that area there where there's quite a bit of elevation there where I would say the ground floor is almost a story and half higher in some areas to almost a story that it just makes it an unequal way of laying out the project. And I think that just makes it a non-starter. I mean, if you want to have some sort of business down there, you're going to have to chip away at that granite. If not, you're going to have to then just put residential there. And that's extremely difficult to do residential right on top of a big rock essentially that's along that side there. So I was thinking that we should find all the areas that would be easier to put this housing in. And I think the group found something on the other side of Mass Ave. I think that was good. So that was just it, just the locations for that. This doesn't make sense. That's all. Great. Ken, can I ask you one question before we go to the others for comment? Does the majority of these in Option and Alternative 1, the majority of these sites in the Heights Extension area are in the neighborhood multifamily district? Does the reduction down to a maximum of three stories change your concerns at all in that area? No. Okay. Just wanted to ask the question. Just it makes it very impossible to drive way up there. That's fine. So. Understood.

> Steve. In terms of the two maps, I don't have particularly strong feelings. I could go either way.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 186</summary>

> Gene. Yeah, I looked at both areas. I don't have strong feelings except that if you go down Poll Revere Road, there are houses there now. So I don't see how they couldn't be converted to three-story buildings. Or that's my only question about that. So I too walked the topography of both of these areas. And my concern, like Ken's, is that it's challenging for many of these that are single family at this point to deal with the grade because of the, again, the driveways, et cetera. Once you start adding multifamily in this particular area without the, I believe that some of them have on-street parking waivers currently, but without that as a official town policy, this becomes a challenging area, to Ken's point, to actually create multifamily housing within. So at this time, to me, it looks like the topography is extremely challenging in this area to achieve the goal of the MBTA communities. And I think alternative, too, has the one nice part about it is it does get close to the bikeway. And that is a transportation resource in Arlington.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 18</summary>

> So do we, are we seeing a consensus towards, can you are in favor of alternative two? Yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 68</summary>

> Steve? Yeah, I think I'm settling on alternative two. I'd prefer alternative two. Gene? I'd be fine with either, so two is fine. I just wonder whether, is it actually up against the bikeway?  If it is, do we need to have some special rules for the buildings that are up against the bikeway? Can you give me an example? I don't know. That's what I'm asking.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 71</summary>

> Yeah, I'm saying, do we have special, I'm not sure we have special rules. There's a special permit requirement. There are not, other than it is currently a special permit requirement that would eliminate that for these parcels if they are included as part of the MBTA communities overlay district. I'm fine with that. I am as well. Same here. OK. OK. All right, so alternative two will be the recommendation.

<details><summary>Orvis Road Parcels</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 288</summary>

> Back to Orvis. Back to Orvis. So again, I think just looking at what we looked at there in the heights, one of the things I actually liked is that there are a couple of districts that are deeper. And I really do feel that it's appropriate for that in this particular section in East Arlington. I was actually surprised when I received the map that they are as shallow as they are in the neighborhood districts that were added in to the east of Orvis. So interested in what people think about looking at deepening those parcels, particularly where there is a shallow parcel that is adjacent to Mass Ave. I think the north side of Mass Ave after Orvis has some deep sites. I think the south side is deep site challenged if we look at that. And I don't want to use that. I agree with Steve that that is a consideration, but I'd rather look at it and go back to the original comments. Let's take a look at this as a whole instead of just looking at it and getting a piecemeal in it for now. I think we made a commitment that we're going to look at East Arlington along Mass Ave. We're going to make a look at Mass Ave along the heights. And let's do that in the spring where we can see the whole thing. And that's fine, because I don't think including that in and jamming it in with the Mass Ave is just one extra thing. It could be a consequence that came out of something that we didn't know about. Let's just take a little time to look at that area there. That's all. OK. Gene?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 151</summary>

> Is it possible to just eliminate the parcels behind the shallow parcels on Mass Ave and keep the others in?  Because if you look, let's say, between Orvis and Lake, there's just one shallow parcel. And then they're not too shallow until you get to between Edgerton and Melrose. And then there are a couple parcels along Milton. And then the rest are the way down. So maybe the way to do it is to be a little more discerning about which ones stay in and which ones leave. I don't know if we can do that and still have a contiguous district. I think that's the challenge with moving them around is maintaining contiguity. So my understanding, and Claire, perhaps you can answer this for us, is the rough rule of thumb that was used, that you went 150 feet in East Arlington and 350 feet in the heights?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 1</summary>

> Correct.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 111</summary>

> OK. So could I suggest that we go back to 250 feet deep in East Arlington east of Orvis Road to maintain the continuity?  So basically, essentially taking what's scenario 3A and just moving it basically north of Mass Ave and south of Mass Ave. Yes. I think that's fine. I'm uncomfortable making a decision like tonight on this. When we looked at this originally, we did spend some time looking at this. And I don't want to just decide that big of a swath change tonight here like this. I'd rather take some time to look at this and study it a little bit more. That's my opinion. Gene?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 16</summary>

> Did we give notice to the owners 250 feet deep on both sides of Mass Ave?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 25</summary>

> We gave notice. There is a 300 foot buffer required for notification. So those folks would have been noticed as part of the buffer accommodation.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 38</summary>

> So if we do what Rachel suggested and extend the zone 250 feet on each side of Mass Ave in East Arlington and remove some of the parcels that are on shallow, would we have given enough notice?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker ? - 40</summary>

> So those property owners were notified of the September 11th meeting. I think I would have to go back and spot check to make sure. But I do think the board can be relatively comfortable with, yes, they've been noticed.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson and Others - 309</summary>

> Well, I think considering that they were once on the map and then they were taken off when the zone was moved, the wider zone was moved west, I'm comfortable putting them back on because my understanding was they were removed not because they were inappropriate, but just to move things around a bit. So balance the two sides. Yes, so I'm comfortable with what Rachel suggested and then removing the parcels that are behind the shallow lots. Because that's what that is. That's what I'm suggesting. So we would need to be specific as to which of these parcels we would want to remove if we did want to remove any at this time, or rather simply by extending this allows us to ensure that if any changes are made in the future that we still have a contiguous neighborhood zone. My preference would be to basically redraw it along the 250-foot line and maintain our contiguity at that distance from the street. At the back line. And Steve, are you saying then to keep the current parcels with the extension or to remove some of the parcels? No, to move them. So if the, if like, just. Between Winter and Cleveland, for example. Yeah. Or for, I was thinking more along the lines of if you took the area between say Melrose and Fairmont. Those are probably, the southern edge of that line of parcels is probably 100 feet off the road, or 150 feet. I'm suggesting move that back to 250 feet. So it wouldn't be, in fact, adding. Yeah, basically move, take what's there and shift it away from the road. On both sides of Mesa? On both sides. Wouldn't be my preference, but I could live with that. Well, it wouldn't be my preference, but I could live with it, too. You suggested it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 167</summary>

> It's not my preference, and I don't want to live with it. I really do think that it should be deeper in this area. I don't disagree with you there. But I just don't want to rush because we want to get this out tonight. I'm not suggesting, I don't feel like it's rushed because I feel like I've seen enough, sorry, I want to make sure I'm speaking. I feel like I've seen enough iterations of this, and this was a concern that Gene and I raised several times, was that this area was not deep enough, you know, relative to the way that we're exploring this in other areas. So I'm perfectly comfortable extending this to 250 feet east of Orvis off of the center line of Mass Ave. Yeah, and again, the expectation is that we would look at the business districts and, you know, perhaps doing infill with multifamily districts at the same time, you know, taking it, you know, as one whole.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 699</summary>

> Okay. So what it sounds like we're centering around is accepting option scenario 3A with the caveat of extending the neighborhood districts to 250 feet, the neighborhood district zone to 250 feet from the center line of Mass Ave. from east of Orvis to the AY Brook Parkway. Or at least to the streets here, which are Fairmont and Henderson. You're correct. Thank you very much. I'm going to have to pull that up. Fairmont? Thank you. And I still need some clarity. Are we keeping the current parcels in that zone or are we removing them all or some of them? I believe we are likely removing them and adding different ones in their place. All right. So all of these are going to disappear and be replaced. I'm not in alignment with that. Okay. That's what I'm trying to understand. Sorry. Let me just take notes. If you two want to keep discussing. No. No. Okay. So we're accepting option 3A. Okay. Can I ask an interruption? Okay. So there's probably two things so far that I'm not in agreement with. So are we going to vote on these individually or vote on the whole thing as one, to pass or not pass?  And. That's a great question. Because I don't want just to fail because of the two things that I have feelings for. So I've been taking more or less informal votes by asking for people's opinions. I am more than happy to take a formal vote once we go through all of these on each one of these items or if there are specific ones that we want to for record ensure that we have individual votes for and then pass the overall. We need to take a singular vote on this Warren article at the end of the day. So we can continue if the board feels comfortable. We can continue in the way that we have been working through this. And again, this is a public working session. The where we informally identify what we are planning on accepting as the amended version of this to move forward into town meeting or we can take, we can identify which we would like to take a formal vote for. record on knowing that at the end of the day, we need to vote on a singular Warren article to provide favorable action or to vote action or no action on. Okay. So, would you prefer to take a formal vote on several of these for record leading up to the vote of action or no action? No. We do this all at the end. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, going back to the depth of this district, so we, this would be extending from Orvis Road to Fairmont on the south side of Mass Ave. and Henderson Street on the northern side of Mass Ave. to 250 feet from the center line. Okay. Residential only properties. Right. Residential zone properties. Okay. And I apologize, I don't have the map pulled up while I'm typing. It's Henderson. And Fairmont. Fairmont. Henderson Street and Fairmont Street. Thank you. And the reason it stops there is because of flood plain. Thank you. Okay. The next item is. Wait. Wait. I need clarity on are we removing the current parcels or are we just adding more depth to the current parcels? My preference is to just add more depth. Well, that's my preference, too. Okay. Mine is not. Well, actually, no. Adding more depth, that means, so, if I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly, that means we're not really addressing the shallow parcel phenomenon. Again, if there are specific parcels that you would like us, we need to then be specific about which parcels. I think, overall, the district is too narrow in this area, again, my request was to. Well, if I would, my preference, all right, I'll throw an alternative out. Please. So, widen to 250 feet on either side of Mass Ave. Yes. And remove everything between, everything less than 150 feet from Mass Ave. So, think of drawing a thick band and then hollowing out the middle. Where'd 150 feet come from, Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak and Others - 877</summary>

> That is my opening offer. I'm trying to think of a parcel that we would consider deep enough and what, how deep it is. Well, I would like to leave 100 feet on either side of Mass Ave. 150? At least 100 feet of parcel depth for future business district expansion. All right, that makes more sense to me than 150 feet. Okay, then I will change my offer to 100. 100 feet from the center line? I think it's too arbitrary. Really? I think we should leave it as it is now. And I personally, I think we need to extend the, I would not be comfortable setting an arbitrary number. I know that 250 feet is what we originally started with looking at for the depth of this district. For some reason, I don't understand it was narrowed. I think it's too shallow now to provide any real continuity. And I'd prefer to see what we have now for the neighborhood districts deep into 250. Okay, I'll agree with that. My preference would still be to go with three with the other option and clear everything off of Orvis Road and come back to it. But if Madam Chair, if you and Mr. Benson agree, I'll go along with it. Nope. Fair enough. Now, just a clarification. 250 feet, some of the parcels may be part in and part out. Are they therefore in or out of the district?  What have we done up to this point? What was the working group? It's where they fall off. You go to sort of the nearest parcel line. That makes sense. That's why the area is narrowed. I'm sorry to press my point again, but that's where we took time and looked at things. I understand, but this was requested to be looked at and it was missed. And so I don't feel comfortable moving forward with this until we address it. So perhaps we identify that we go one parcel deeper on each of the both north and south of Mass Avenue. That would be fine. It's too shallow. Can somebody explain? I think that may be fine, but it would be helpful if somebody who is on the working group, Steve or Ken, can explain what led to the shrinking of the depth and how this was determined to be the proposal. Basically, the feeling of the working group at the time was that it was too heavy in East Arlington because there were districts along two corridors, Mass Ave and Broadway. And with the heights, because of the way the business districts come out, there are a lot of areas where you don't have anything on the business. You have commercial parcels on the north side. And we basically had a skinny strip on the south. So now that we, if we remove the Mass Ave parcels, that changes the scale and we would therefore need to add back. Is that a fair way to look at it?  That's how I'm looking at it, Gene, yes. I'm fine with that. So one more parcel deep. So I would propose to extend the neighborhood district by one additional parcel. Let's be very clear on this. Between Lake Street and Fairmont. Right? Lake Street, Fairmont and Henderson. On the south side. Right. And? Windsor and Henderson on the north side. Which one are you suggesting? Windsor and Henderson. Winter? Winter, I'm sorry, and Henderson on the north side. Winter and Henderson on the north side. Right. May I suggest a few specific parcels for removal? Please. Please. Okay. Let me just update that. North side. Gene, can you just read off the streets for me? It was on north side from Winter to Henderson. And on the south side from Lake to Fairmont. What about those two blocks between Orville and Winter? What happens there? They have deep parcels. No. Yes. Yes, Gene. They have deep parcels. Right. But what are we doing there? Are we saying leave it alone? Or are we leaving it as a neighborhood community and leaving the front side open? Because I just want to know what we're doing there. As proposed in the current map. Okay. And that would be the same between Orville and Lake Street?  That would be as proposed? Yes. So current map as in 3A? Yes. Okay. So I'm going to work from east, sorry, from west to east, left to right. Starting on the north side of Mass Ave. Remove, you know, widen the row between Winter Street and Cleveland. And also between Cleveland and Marathon. So you're adding additional parcels to the neighborhood community? I'm suggesting removing parcels from the neighborhood. Actually, may I go up to the map and point? That might be easier. Sure. Okay. Just wanted to get on stage. So I'm suggesting knock out this little narrow strip. So a row of parcels here. One row here. This tooth. This tooth. These teeth. This, this, this. And that's it. Just one parcel deep. Yeah, basically. I don't feel like we have enough detail shown on this map to see the parcel size to be able to make that call of removing them. Gene, what are your thoughts?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson and Others - 315</summary>

> Yeah, I agree. I'd prefer to keep them in, again, without the information. Unless somebody from the working group has the underlying lot configuration here. Yeah, look at scenario 3B. Perfect, thank you. That shows the parcels. So I don't have both printed out in front of me. Here. 3B, what's the other one you want? 3B and 3A side by side. I've got chicken scratches all over it, though. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, C. So you were suggesting, so you were suggesting which parcels? So start with winter. We'll start with between winter and Cleveland. Yes. So there's kind of, behind the commercial section there, there's that big L-shaped one. I think we're going to leave that one in. Leave that one, yep. But we can go back one more along Cleveland Street. We could also go back one more between Cleveland and Marathon. And at the corner of Windsor and Mass Ave, one more deep there. Between Windsor. So the corner of. Yep, I see what you're saying. Yep. And so let me take a look at Amsden. Yep, go one in on the northeast corner of Amsden. Jumping back and forth between these. And then, so let's go around Milton Street. Yep, those two small. Yep, those two little ones. Yep. Let's go over between Varnum and Magnolia. I think that can stay as is. Yep. And then Thorndike. There's that, you know, you've got two little ones on the corner there. The southeast corner of Thorndike and Mass Ave. Perfect. Did you want us to look at the. Yep. I was looking on. Okay, you're good. I think that's all fine if anybody. That's acceptable to me. Yeah, if anybody can actually commit it to paper or something. I will read that out. I will read that out when we make the motion. Okay. I'm just going to update my notes.

<details><summary>Aligned Zoning with Overlay District</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 108</summary>

> Okay, so the next item on our agenda or on our list was confirm that we are aligned on zoning when looking at parcels in and out of the overlay district. Gene, this was one that you added. This was section 5.9.1C where Gene wanted to confirm that the board was aligned with the text that he added And therefore, if a proposed development is located on a parcel or parcels only partially within the Mass Ave. and Broadway multifamily district or the multifamily neighborhood districts, the provisions for the existing underlying zoning shall apply and not that of the overlay districts. Because that was missing from this.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 20</summary>

> I agree. I could see a situation where that happened and things would creep down some of the side streets.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 200</summary>

> I understand that, Gene. But when you, now you changed the area which you're allowed to do as of right. I would propose that if a new parcel straddles two different parcels, one MBTA overlay and one that does not straddle that, then each parcel that's in its respective area would have to follow that area's regulations. Because what you're saying is now the area that was MBTA area is now, because you're combining lots, you're making it more restrictive. Because now you have to go through special permit. You have to do all this other stuff. So you're actually decreasing the number of lots or areas that do that. No, I think you're misunderstanding what I'm doing. I'm not changing something so if a parcel is in the mass Broadway multifamily district, it complies with those rules. But how about a parcel that's partially within that district. The parcel's all in that district. Then somebody buys. And combines the properties. The adjacent property. So you had a parcel that was in the district, in the overlay. And you had a parcel that was not in the overlay. They've now combined them. The question is, which of the rules apply?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson and Others - 300</summary>

> I think the rule that should apply is the underlying rule. Or else somebody could buy three or four parcels, combine them, and all of a sudden you'd have, you know, a tall building way into the neighborhood, which was not the intention. I would agree with you there. But if I were to look at it the other way, if I had one parcel that was not in the overlay, one parcel that was in the overlay, now you're saying if I combine those two pieces of property because it makes a bigger lot, then that bigger lot has to fall not within the MBTA community, it has to fall within the original underlining. Right. So that means you're carving into that portion that was in MBTA, now no longer becomes that because you combined the lots. Only if you combine the lots. You don't have to combine the lots. You could do it the other way. This was silent. It didn't say, and I decided we needed to know which way we were going to go, and one of the comments that I read from someone, I don't remember who it was, said, you know, these things are going to proliferate, that's not the word that the person used, proliferate all the way down the street. And I agree with you, but what if we just said that the lot that was on MBTA stays with that, and that portion of that project can fall within the height requirements and everything else that goes with the MBTA, but the lot that was not cannot assume those rights. They have to stay with the underlaying lot, so it doesn't continue down the street. But what was existing before maintains the rights of the MBTA overlay. How would that work?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 267</summary>

> So you own a parcel in the overlay. You buy the parcel next door, which is not in the overlay. You combine them. You want to put something on both parcels. So one is two and a half stories high, and the other one is four stories high or three stories high. So for the building, you have to get a special permit for half the building? No. You follow what's required for, yeah, you could get a special permit if you want to make it all the way across the same way, and we have the chance to review it. But let's say the parcel that was not in the overlay, and as a right, is two and a half stories, and it's just a house. And then once you step onto the overlay, they can go to a three-story or four-story, wherever we decide, okay? And so now it could be a row of townhouses in those two combined lots, because you've got rid of the side yard setbacks, and it makes it more efficient. The portion that was existing in MBTA would get the benefit of MBTA, and the portion that was not has to be following the underlay requirements unless they go for a special permit. That's all I'm saying, is maintaining the rights of the MBTA, instead of just, if you combine lots, now you're encroaching on the other side. You're doing the direct opposite of what you're saying trying to prevent, which is marching down the road. You're just marching down the road with non-MBTA requirements, if you combine lots. Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 180</summary>

> I think I'm going to agree with Mr. Lau. So how would you reword this? Because I am struggling to see how you would have your foot in both spaces. I actually agree with Gene in that we need to pick a lane here and either decide that one governs or the other. I'm really struggling with how a site plan review versus a special permit process coexist. We are drawing a line down the middle of a building to identify that half of it meets one set of rules and the other half meets the other. In terms of applying a special permit or applying site plan review to a partial project, this is something the Zoning Board of Appeals does all the time. You have someone who's rebuilding something, but they want to go forward a little bit with a porch. So you have a special permit hearing, which is focused on just the porch and only the porch. Understood. Much like we do for signs and other items. Exactly. If the proposed development is ... Go ahead.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 239</summary>

> The portion of the building that is not in the MBTA communities, if it still falls within its underlying zoning, you don't need a special permit. So you would build a ... Depending on the ... I mean, there's a lot of if, then, buts. Yeah, but it's the same with everything else we're doing here. So if we had a project that they want to combine properties, the portion of the property that was on MBTA would have all its rights, and the portion of the property that does not have it, does not. So let's say ... So one half of it has to maintain its underlying zoning things. So it achieves what Gene's trying to say. You don't buy property to combine and carry that all the way down the street. It stops where we had it stopped. But it doesn't go the other way, just because you combine properties. Now you have to fall within the older scheme. So you can have townhomes, three, four story, three, four family units, then when you step over the MBTA, it goes down to two, and that's maybe you have some ... Townhomes are a whole other ... But that's what ... Well, you asked me how would you build one building that would straddle both properties, and I just gave you an example, that's all. Yes, there's another, but I'm just ... It's an example. Okay. Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 27</summary>

> Well, in terms of wording, I'll ... Here's an idea. So 591C, so the last ... Sort of the ending of it, starting with the word B.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery and Others - 454</summary>

> Yes. Okay. The provisions of the existing underlying zoning shall apply to parcels outside the overlay district. So if Ken and you, as a partnership, have combined these two parcels, they're now one parcel. They're not two parcels anymore. So you can't say one parcel is in, and one parcel is out. Okay. But the rules are saying that when you combine the parcels, the original zoning for each parcel still carries forth on the MBTA overlay. So that's all I'm saying, because otherwise you're decreasing what you already established as square footage. If your point is to decrease it, then let's decrease it. Let's not use this as a ... I don't think anyone's looking to decrease it. It's, again, to deal with over ... And I agree with you. Let's not do over and then march down the street. That's not the issue here. Right. And again, I don't think Gene is at all looking for ways to decrease ... Right. So there are a whole bunch of requirements that will exist in the underlying district that will not exist in the overlay district. Not only whether you need a special permit or not, the height, the number of units, the dimensional requirements for various sorts of things. I just think it's going to be crazy to try to take, whether they're two or three townhomes or a six-unit multi-building, and figure out what to do with part of it in what had been a parcel in the overlay district and part of it that had been a parcel that was not in the overlay district. And two sets of rules, two different procedures to follow, it just makes it a lot worse for the developer. The developer will be better off not combining the parcels, building one building on one and one building on the other, or figuring out whether it wants to go with the underlying zoning and do it, rather than, oh, I've got to go for a special permit for this part of the building. And for site plan review for this part, I have one set of dimensional rules for one part of the building, another set of dimensional rules for the other part of the building. It just seems to me it's a way to make a lot of trouble. I would actually agree. I think, again, we're trying to simplify and make things easier to develop. If you're interested in creating a project where you combine parcels creatively in that way, treating them as separate projects seems to be the appropriate way to approach this. I appreciate. I point taken about simplification. So it sounds like three of us are in agreement on this one.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Street Trees</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 216</summary>

> Okay. The next is around adding street tree requirements subject to zoning bylaw 6.3. Yes. There's another part, which Ken will disagree with me again, I predict. Okay. I missed that. I apologize. Okay. It's the first part of that sentence. So right now the rules are if you're part in the MBMF and part in the NMF, the provision of the MBMF can apply. Okay. So let's take one of these parcels that is on Mass Ave. So it's in the MBMF. And then there are six parcels down the side street, or five, whatever the number turns out to be, that's in the NMF. You combine them all because you've bought up those parcels. You now have a large parcel, part in the MBMF, part in the neighborhood multifamily district. If you apply the rules of the MNFFs, you can build a six-story building that is not only on Mass Ave., but goes five or six parcels down one of the side streets, and you can put commercial on the ground floor in what otherwise would be a residential district. Is that the intention of the working group, to allow that? Or was it just, well, if there just happens to be a parcel right around the corner, it makes sense to allow it?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 33</summary>

> I believe we were considering the case where it was, you know, something along, you know, with frontage on Mass Ave. and a parcel behind it. Yeah. But not necessarily a whole string.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 66</summary>

> Yeah. This is a problem with how it's written, unless you want to say, one parcel deep off Mass Ave. or Broadway, is, I think, a way to ameliorate the potential problem. So perhaps we could, if I could make a suggestion, the provisions of the MBMF district shall apply for a maximum of one parcel depth. Yeah. Yes. Into the NMF? Yep. That's good. Ken?

> Okay. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Moving on, adding the street tree requirement subject to ZBL 6.3. So if we're going to bring a street tree amendment to town meeting, the street tree amendment, if town meeting approves it, would say they're in residential districts, too, then all we would have to do here is add something to the regulations that say all of these are subject to Section 6.3. No, I believe that was the . . . That was the intention?  Yeah, that was the intent. Ken?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 226</summary>

> The intent of the MBTA community zoning overlay was to make it easy to build housing. So there are bonuses that are added to encourage affordable housing, site changes, solar, whatever. So I think in the spirit of it, I think since we're already covering street trees as part of something we want to put as a zoning ordinance that would just go and stand on its own, but not tie this in with the MBTA communities, because we're not giving it a bonus, we're making it a requirement. We are making it a requirement. As part of the MBTA communities. And we were asked to do that. And is that part . . . is that legal for a challenge? Because now you're making something that's a requirement, and the issue was not to make it a requirement. I'm not saying . . . I'm not for street trees. I'm just saying, does this stand the test? It stands the test if we amend . . . the town meeting amends the street tree bylaw to . . . right now the street tree bylaw only applies to certain commercial buildings. Our proposal is to have it apply . . . To residential as well. Residential as well. So then if we make it a requirement here, it's a parallel requirement. It's not a problem.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 112</summary>

> Dan, can we make it a saying that if the town passes this ordinance, then this would become part of it. If the town does not pass it, this is not a requirement as part of the MBTA. Again, I think this goes back to the question of . . . are all of the items from the underlying zoning requirements unless otherwise amended or addressed in this here? And I see Sanjay raising his hand. Yes, there's a microphone right over . . . and a chair right over by Claire. So in terms of . . . Sanjay, sorry. If you could just introduce yourself for the record. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sanjay Newton - 653</summary>

> Sanjay Newton. I was chair of the MBTA Human Use Working Group. I think this question of what applies from underlying zoning versus what . . . I think what the working group was going for and the intention was that where there are things that are specific to the underlying zone, those don't apply to the overlay, right? Where there are things that apply to zoning in general, those do apply unless specifically noted. So if the underlying zone is . . . I'm going to pick R4 or R5, right? Things that are specific to R5 don't apply, right? If there are things that apply to all residential zones, right, then those would apply. Or all zones. Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. All zones. Excuse me. All zones. Yes, yes, yes. That's not true. So he's interpreting it the way I have interpreted it. Correct. Which is this is not a business zone. This is not a residential zone. So the business zoning requirements, the residential zoning requirements don't apply. But the part of the zoning bylaw that applies to all zones . . . Yes. . . . would apply to it. So you and I agree on that. So then we wouldn't need to add anything in, Gene, if town meeting passes . . . No, no. We . . . Can I just finish my thought? Okay. Go ahead. Article 10. Because the way that we currently have it written in Article 10 is that it should be administered . . . it is subject to be administered by Section 3.3, Special Permit 3.4, Environmental Design Review, and Section 9.X, which is what this will be, which would then allow this to apply to both residential as well as . . . No. No. Because not . . . unfortunately not the way I wrote it. We'd have to amend it. Because what it says . . . We could amend it when we get to that one, yep. Right. In the business and residential districts . . . Can we change it to all districts? When we get to . . . when we get to Article 10, I will have some wording . . . some wording changes to propose. Because the article is written as all developments, not specific to . . . the Article 10, the way it's written is require a street tree to be planted for every 25 feet of street frontage for all developments. All new developments, yeah. So we have some latitude to edit that. The problem with that is that we have a different street tree requirement in the industrial zone already, and specific to the industrial zone. But that is an exception to this. So we would have to . . . But it's already an exception in the industrial . . . No. But if we say in all districts, then we have a contradiction in the bylaw. Then perhaps we write all districts except the industrial district. Yes. We would have to do that. Okay. And that would allow us to not have to add it to this one, and we will take care of editing that when we get to Article 10. With that . . . I have to think about which one's better. Okay. Other thoughts? Nope. I'm happy with that. Okay. Thank you, Sanjay. Okay. So we will review altering the wording of Article 10 to include the overlay district. Yeah. I guess we could say just to . . . Please. Let's finish the thought out. Yep. Just to think this through for a second, we could say in the business, residential, and MBTA overlay districts. We could be as specific as we want to get. Right. Yes. So we could do that. Yes. Multifamily housing overlay districts. Okay. Yes.  In this article, we'll do that in Article 10.

<details><summary>Solar Roof Requirement</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 23</summary>

> Okay. The next item is solar roof requirements for the Massachusetts and Broadway Multifamily District. Gene, your thoughts on where to add this?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 131</summary>

> Yes. So, let me pull up the solar bylaw for a second. So, right now. Section 6.4. Right now, the solar energy system only requires is for a project requiring environmental design review. Correct. And those projects, as we know, are generally projects along Mass Ave. and Broadway that require a special permit. My thought is that we should apply it only in the Mass and Broadway Multifamily District, not in the neighborhood district. Because there we're dealing with a lot of three-family homes and we're not, we haven't imposed that requirement there. So, I would just impose it on the two streets where we have it now for EDR review. You know, the alternative, well, we can't do that because it's too late. So, we can't amend the solar bylaw.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 20</summary>

> So, Gene, are you suggesting that we add, for example, a section 13 or fold it into the development standards?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 7</summary>

> Either that or put a separate section.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 32</summary>

> Yeah, one or the other. We might put it in the development standards. I feel like it belongs in the development standards. Sure. Steve, what are your thoughts? No, that's fine. Ken?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 268</summary>

> Development standards in the MBTA overlay or separate ordinance? Much like in section 5.9.4 development standards, we reference other sections that apply and do not apply to identify that section 6.4, the solar energy systems requirements are required in the Mass Ave and Broadway Multifamily District. That would be a line item under the development standards. So, it would be no longer 6.4. 6.4 stays in, you know, that is in the zoning bylaw. We're referencing here that, for example, 6.4, unfortunately because of the way 6.4 is written, it requires, so we could do it one of two ways. We could either say a project requiring environmental design review per 3.4.2 or. Except we can't do that because we don't have a solar bylaw article going to town meeting. So, we have to put it in the development standards. Right. So, that is one way to do. So, right, there's two ways. We could either do that, but you're right, we don't have that one currently in or, again, we add before number 12 or. Somewhere in there. In here we add the, or section 6.4.1 applies to all projects in the MBMF. I don't know. It seems like we're getting away from the spirit of this overlay and we're burdening it with all these other criteria's when clearly it says that we're giving it relief from all these other extra burdens. And if you want to do other things, you get a bonus for it. But I don't see a bonus for this. This seems like you have to do this or you don't get it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 44</summary>

> That's exactly right because the town has identified that for these large developments that this solar bylaw is important to the town. So, leave it as the town zoning is underlaying and that still applies. And just take it off of the MBTA requirement.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 48</summary>

> It doesn't because the way that that is written is it requires environmental design review, so we need to, like these other things, make the provision that it also applies for this process, which is site plan review. Because they're not coming in front of environmental design review.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 9</summary>

> So, it's a requirement for site plan review only?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 58</summary>

> It is a requirement for the multifamily business, excuse me, the Massachusetts and Broadway multifamily district within this process, which again is not specified in that particular section because it is specific to environmental design review. But again, because it's only the Mass Ave. and Broadway, these are the larger projects, again, that are aligned with the requirements.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 32</summary>

> Oh, I'm all for this requirement. I'm just not sure how we do this now. And I mean, it would, ideally we would handle this in the same way we handle trees.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 199</summary>

> Yes. Except we don't have a solar bylaw going to town meeting. So, we can handle it this way. Because this is how you've done it with affordable housing. You could have amended the affordable housing part of the zoning bylaw to include this district, but you didn't. And there's nothing wrong with not having done it. Either way, I think is perfectly acceptable. Instead, what the working group decided to do was to say the affordable housing requirements apply to these. Similarly, we say the solar bylaw requirements apply in the, you know, MBMF district. So, Claire, I have a question for you before we discuss this further. Much like we have amended multiple sections, section two definitions and section five district regulations, because of the way that the Warren article is written relative to amending the zoning bylaw to adopt the MBTA community overlay district or take any action relative there to. We're defining site plan review as part of the MBTA community's overlay district. Would it be reasonable to assume that the scope of this Warren article would also allow us to amend section 6.4 to include site plan review in addition to environmental design review?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 62</summary>

> Yes, it would be correct to assume that. I would want to get a ruling from the moderator. Of course, if he says the other way, then we're sunk. And I don't think we need to do it. I think it's just as acceptable to put it into this new section 5.9. My concern about, I understand where you're going, Madam Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 242</summary>

> My concern is that might put us into the two-thirds territory. I mean, I'm fine with putting it into development standards. I'm just trying to find a way that's clean to do this. So I'm fine with adding another section saying that 6.4 is applicable in the MBMF district. Okay. Signs. Signs. So since Sanjay and I agree about what the intention was in this, and if you look at the sign bylaws, for each one of the signs, they say what the rules are for residential, residential slash business, business districts. But there's no rule for the overlay district. And we don't want to put this in the residential district because some of them may be multi-use, some of them might be tall apartment buildings on Mass Ave and Broadway. And if you look at those, the higher R district numbers have different sign rules than the lower R district numbers. So my thought about how to do this is similar to what I'm proposing for the solar bylaw, which is to say it's subject to the sign bylaw and in the NMF, it's subject to the requirements of the residential sign district. In the MBMF for residential buildings, it's subject to the residential slash business sign district. And for mixed use in the MBMF, it's subject to the business sign district because that most correctly corresponds to how we deal with those things now. That makes sense to me. Kim?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 15</summary>

> I'll be fine with that for now. Yeah. I'm also fine with it, Madam Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 53</summary>

> OK, can you, so that I can put that in for record, so that I can read it out, can you, is that written on? Yeah. Thank you. Let's skip that. I'll come back to the next one. While I'm typing this out, Gene, if you want to go to the duplicate requirements.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 220</summary>

> OK. So if you look at 5, 9, 4, 10, it says the minimum front setback is 15 feet, except in the MBMF district where the ground floor facade facing public way, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, is zero. But then if you look at the next page, it tells you it's 15 feet in the chart. And in the bonus right below that, it tells you that there's no front yard setback. It's reduced to zero. So you have the exact same information in the chart in 12 and in bonuses as you have in 10. So my suggestion would be to delete 10 from 5.9.4D10, except take the sentence that says, minimum required front setback area shall be available for uses such as trees, landscaping, benches, tables, chairs, play areas, public art, or similar features, and move it to a note under the chart on the next page, which is really where it belongs, I think. The only thing is you can't say public art, because it's not technically public art. It's art. It's not the public art. So we would have to remove the word public, but we could otherwise take it and move it to an explanation of what we expect in the front setback. So that's how I think we get rid of that duplicate.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 115</summary>

> Oh, Gene, the intent was to have a 15-yard setback along Mass Ave and Broadway. Right, not changing that. And then if you did a mixed-use project along Mass Ave and Broadway, the lower floors, or you delete that setback. I'm not changing that. I'm just saying it appears twice in here. I just want to get rid of one of the two times it says it. OK. Yeah. So I just want to make sure that I'm writing this properly. We're eliminating the first sentence, and we're moving the second sentence to the chart in 12. Well, the second and the third sentence, the parking spaces, are not permitted. We're moving both of those.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 85</summary>

> Thank you. Rachel? Yes. Can we go back to site certifiable?  Yes, absolutely. I have those highlighted to go back to. While I was taking notes, I just couldn't do both of those at the same time. Thank you. Sorry. I'm trying to let you finish. I wish we had somebody to take notes for me here. OK. Second and third. I have to read this all back to us at the end. All right. I'm going to highlight that one and that one.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 16</summary>

> OK, let's go back to the sites. Sites. Certifiable. So can I take this one, Gene?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 294</summary>

> Please do. OK. My feeling is that for an additional floor, certifiable is not a high enough standard. I've seen the LEED certifiable checklists that come in front of us, and they are barely checking a box. They typically have no understanding of what it is they are actually filling out. And for us to allow for additional floors, I feel like they actually need to be doing something to make the projects more sustainable. I also question whether sites is the right standard. I work in the green building space, and I rarely, if ever, see any sites certifiable or site standards in terms of the rating system come in front of me. So my suggestion would be to reword this to perhaps use LEED gold certified or equivalent level of alternate green building standard as reviewed and approved by the Department of Planning and Community Development or the Redevelopment Board. So give them an option to use passive house, well, sites if they want to, but set a standard that is more regularly seen and adopted within the green building community, and set a certified rather than certifiable standard to achieve the additional story. So LEED gold certified. Certified or equivalent level of alternative or alternate, green building standard as reviewed and approved by the Department of Planning and Community Development and or the Redevelopment Board. So it would be through the town's environmental planner or through the review process for site plan review. I like that. My suggestion would be approved by the Redevelopment Board, because then we could have either Claire or David Morgan or whoever go to us and explain why. And so it's an appropriate one to use in this situation, and then we could make the call.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 35</summary>

> I'm OK with that, but I agree. I think that I would want to involve the experts in our town planning department in that process. I agree. Ken, what are your thoughts on that one?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 55</summary>

> Thinking. Understood. The other thing that we could do is if there are two or three other standards, would we want to adopt them in our rules and regulations rather than? Sorry, if there are other standards, do we want to adopt them in our rules and regulations rather than a case by case basis?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery and Others - 325</summary>

> That's a great question. My feeling is that the standards continue to evolve, which I think is great. And our rules and regulations, to your point, are easier to revise and adopt in a minute. Thank you, adopt in a minute. But I think this approach would be similar to what we just adopted with regard to the stormwater treatment, where we identified a standard or alternative path as opposed to naming all of the alternatives. So in my mind, it's consistent with what town meeting approved previously. I think I agree with you that certifiable is not correct to get an extra floor bonus. And the buildings won't get any taller. They're just going to have to choose. Do they want to go with a green building or buildings with affordable units in it? Or mixed use. Or mixed use. Right. To get that bonus. Yes. And so if that's a choice they have, I think I'm OK with that. Yes, it wouldn't change the fact that they have a choice of compliance paths for the bonus. Because they're not going to just build on it. It's not going to be, I get two here, I get two here, here. Correct. It's not cumulative. It's four. That was the intent of the working group, that all these bonuses were not cumulative, and they can choose. Do we want to say LEED gold certified or better? Or at least LEED gold certified?  We can say minimum LEED gold certified. It does say that, right? Is it gold or better, right? Minimum. Well, I'm kind of changing the whole thing. If we say that it's minimum LEED gold certified or equivalent level of alternative green building standard. Fine. That is a question that just came up in my mind. Under bonuses, where are we explicit that these are not cumulative? I just want to make sure. We had something there. Shall not exceed six stories.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 29</summary>

> OK, thank you. As long as you're there. I just wanted to double check. As long as you're on that paragraph. Sanjay, did you want to make a clarification?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sanjay Newton - 37</summary>

> I think they are not cumulative past six stories. Yes. So you could do one story of affordable and one story of, well, whatever you've just decided on. So that is cumulative, but not beyond six. Correct.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 247</summary>

> Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciate that clarification because I did not state that properly before. Thank you, Sanjay. As long as you're looking at that sentence, we should delete and four stories, 46 feet in the NMF because there are no bonuses in the NMF. So we don't need that part of that sentence. We haven't gotten there yet. No, no. But as long as we're on this... No, but you guys brought it down to three stories. We never got the discussion about bonuses on that to add another floor. So you're assuming that three fours is the maximum and we haven't talked about that yet. So I'd like to make sure... I didn't have that on my list, but I will add it, Ken, to talk about the bonuses. Okay. Sorry. Okay. So I will add in, discuss bonuses for NMF. Okay. So we'll come back to that one. The next one I had was adding to the purpose statement, encourage environmental and climate protection sensitive development. Any concerns with that in section 5.9.2? I looked at it and there was nothing about environment or climate, and yet this has solar, it has trees, it has legal certified or similar. So I thought it would be nice to put in that one of the purposes are not to require, but to encourage environmental and climate protection sensitive development. A lot of these are encouraged already. No concerns, Madam Chair. Ken? No. Okay. All right.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Front Yard Setbacks</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 91</summary>

> The next is about front yard setbacks and extra stories relative to the multifamily. Should we restrict... This is where we were going to discuss restaurant and retail or defining the types of businesses that we would accept in the first floor of these, excuse me, require in the first floor of these multifamily or these mixed use buildings, perhaps restrict residences on the first floor in mixed use buildings and whether or not 60% was a high enough requirement for the business use. So I'll open it up to Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 263</summary>

> Well, when we do no residence on the first floor in a mixed use building, that automatically makes that building an elevator building, because you no longer can put a handicapped unit on the first floor and say that this meets ADA. So if we exclude residents on the first floor, now you include elevators in the building, no matter what size. So when we do say that, that comes back to elevated buildings again, where we say that elevators are not a code requirement, it's just an industry standard for four stories and up. Could I suggest that perhaps we identify no residences on the first floor for buildings over four stories? And this is... If they take the bonus. And this is only for mixed use buildings, right? Correct. So this is only to get the bonus. You can't get the bonus for commercial on the ground floor if you have a residential unit on the ground floor. That's true. We're already only talking about buildings over four stories. This is only related to mixed use. Well, at least four stories. Right. Right. So if you're going to get the bonus, you can't have a residence on the ground floor because we're trying to reserve as much of the ground floor as possible for some sort of commercial yet to be defined space. So I don't... What we don't want is somebody to put a residence on the ground floor, unless they're just going to do like a three or four story building without the bonuses, then they can do it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 49</summary>

> Okay. Okay. So we're aligned with no residence. Again, this is for the extra stories for mixed use. No residences on the first floor. Question around restricting the business uses. Steve, you had mentioned that there was originally some language that the working group was looking at for this?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 605</summary>

> So yes. Allowing that mixed use in theMass Ave. Broadway multifamily district would allow commercial uses,would allow the commercial uses allowed in the B2 district. Okay. Goto the table of uses. I don't think I ever saw a draft with that init, so we'll need to take a look at what that is. No, there was neverin the draft. Okay. So that's, that includes offices allowed byspecial permit or allowed by right? Well, they're all, well, there'ssome. I mean, I would imagine this is one detail that was not naileddown, but I think B2 allowed by right. So that would be things likesmaller restaurants under 3,000 square feet, fast food under 1,500square feet, under 3,000 square feet of retail, under 1,000 squarefeet of manufacturing, and so on. And it does include, it does includeoffices. Yes, it does. But Steve, what happens if it's a restaurantgreater than 3,000 square feet? Right, that's where it's, that's achallenging reference. That would be, it would basically mean you'renot going to put it there. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense to me. Infact, a lot of the things in B2 I think that are as of right are notthings where we would necessarily say, oh yeah, there's no need for asetback because of those. I'm looking for things where the advantageof pulling it up to the street and not having the setback is sort ofthe pedestrian experience. So that's clearly going to be, you know,things like retail stores and restaurants and maybe some servicebusinesses. I'm not sure. But if it's just an office, there's noreason an office can't be set back 15 feet. If it's a bank, I think abank can be set back 15 feet, you know. So I'm not quite sure where todraw the line other than retail and restaurants. I know which side ofthe line retail and restaurants go on in my view of this. I don't knowwhat else goes on that side of the line. Business services was onethat you had originally identified. Yeah, but how would we definebusiness services? In the table of uses, that's defined as copycenters, print shops, banks, hair, laundry, dry cleaning, veterinaryand animal care. I'm actually fine with having those come up all theway to the street. Same here. I would agree. It adds to the streetlife there. You know, having it pulled back, now you're holding backbusinesses because... I think it's really a trade between having somegreen space in front of a building and the advantage of pullingbuildings up to the sidewalk for pedestrians being right there. And Ican see it for retail stores. I can see it for restaurants. I can'tsee it for offices. I can't see it for banks particularly. But if youall think banks fit in there... I think business services do and banksare part of that category. So we could say... Restaurant... I'm goingto be consistent with the way that they're defined. Eating anddrinking establishments, retail and business services. Okay. The otheruse that we should consider, and again, it would be a benefit to... Wehave daycare uses that are important to the residents of thesebuildings and which we know we're underserved of in Arlington. I haveto see what category those fall under. But that's something we shoulddiscuss as well. Thoughts? I'm fine with the categories that youproposed and I do agree with daycare. Family child care, that's underaccessory uses. Say that again? Accessory... No, family child care,that's the home care, correct? Claire, do you... Based on thefootnote, it is home child care. Home care, yep, yep. Well, I can findwhere it is, but do we agree that that's one that we should allow aswell? Yes. Gene?

> The ARB does not enforce the site plan review. Yes, site plan review is binding. It's binding.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 131</summary>

> So what we say, the site plan review is binding? Yes. So if we say that you need to change this and they change this, it's binding? Yes. I didn't believe that was the interpretation we had at the working group. I thought it was just a recommendation and it was not binding. It's binding unless it goes beyond what we're allowed to do under the zoning bylaw. Correct. Okay. Is that a site? Okay. So if they chose one site as a primary and they do a setback, a stepback, sorry, a stepback, so the other site does not require a stepback. It could just be flush. Right. They can include one, but it is not required. If the amendment to town meeting passes, currently it is required. Okay. Steve.

<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 141</summary>

> Since we're on the topic of corners, this is a little bit of a jumping back to bonuses in section E1. One of the conditions for a ground floor commercial is that 80% of the frontage be occupied by business uses? Yes. On a corner lot, would that be, is that principal facade only or both facades? Principal facade. Principal. Wouldn't you agree? That's how we've been enforcing that currently. Okay. We haven't discussed yet whether 60% is the right number, though. We have not. Do you have something to, do you have an alternate to propose, Gene, as to 60%? No, just that we have discussed whether 60% is the right number and then we got the letter today from the Chamber of Commerce suggesting 60% was not enough. Madam Chair, I was wondering if Mr. Littell had any insight?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 112</summary>

> Please. Thank you. I think you can adjust it, but our thinking was that it works on both big parcels and smaller parcels. If you had a 10,000 square foot building, that's 6,000 square foot of retail. That's a lot. There's very few establishments that can even fill that. If you have a smaller parcel, let's say your footprint is 3,000 square feet, right, or 2,000 square feet, it would still give you 1,200, but you need space for two means of egress, elevators, lobbies, package room, mechanical. I still think within the 60% on big projects you're getting a lot and on smaller projects you're still, it's still realistic. Maximizing, yeah.

> Thank you. I appreciate it. I also want to add in that bicycle parking on the ground floor is also important. And, you know, if we're trying to enforce or encourage bicycle having it stuffed down the basement or somewhere else is not the way to go. Right, right. So I think we want to have ample room on the ground floor. I'm not taking away from the retail, but I think I'm comfortable with 60%. Okay. I'm also comfortable with 60%. All right. All right, let's leave it there. Let's move on. Next is, see, we were just starting to talk about Section E1. Steve, was that? We just finished that one. We just finished that one, yes.

> Thank you. Section 5.9.4D5, Traffic Visibility Across Street Corners. So this has to do with Sanjay and my interpretation of the draft of the bylaw as opposed to everyone else. So if you look at 5.3.12A, which I'll have to find. Thank you. In more way than one. What number were we on? 5.9.4D5, Traffic Visibility on Street Corners Does Not Apply. Gene had a question about this. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Gene had a question about this. Do you want us to move on while you find that one?

> No. So here's what it says. Across street corners. Between the property lines of intersecting streets in a line joining points on the property lines 20 feet distant from their point of intersection, or in the case of a rounded corner, the point of intersection, or of their tansits, no building or structure in any R district may be erected and no blah, blah, blah, blah. Well, these are not R districts. This is the overlay district. So where the way this is written now for this does not apply in the MBF district. Well, it doesn't apply in either of the districts now because they're not residential districts. So I think what you meant to say, but maybe I'm presuming too much, is the traffic visibility across street corners applies in the NMF overlay district, right? Because you just wanted to apply to that district and not the MBMF district. So I would just flip around what this says to meet what I think was your intention.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various - 247</summary>

> So you would suggest that, Gene, that traffic visibility across street corners, section 5.9.4D5, applies only in the NM. I don't believe so, Gene. I think when we talked about that, we did not say in the surrounding neighborhood districts. We just said that because it is a multi-use . . . It's not a residential house. It's not R1 or R . . . or something like that. R0. This is multi-use and we didn't . . . And so we may talk about that and you may want to change that, but that's not what we talked about. But that's what it says right here in your section. It says it does not apply in the MBMF district, implying that it applies in the neighborhood multi-family district. We didn't talk about that. That's what I'm telling you. It looks like Sanjay has a clarification. This wasn't a big point of discussion in the working group. I'm not sure how much we talked about it, but my understanding of the intention there is what Gene is saying, that the visibility would apply in the neighborhood, right, because that's where we continue to have the setback, right? The corner visibility makes sense. It does not make sense to have it apply in the business districts because we don't have it apply in the business districts. And so the same is true for MN, whatever, Mass Ave, because of the possibility of commercial. That makes sense. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 1122</summary>

> So what I said was what the intention was. Yes. It was not a huge. Change MBMF to NB. Yes. NMF. Yes. Steve, any? Applies in N, saying that it applies in the N neighborhood multi-family district is fine with me. Okay. Ken? No, nothing. Okay. The next one is Gene 5.9.4D8. This says the height buffer area shall not apply. So we have a height buffer area. It only applies under the rules where you look at the chart and the chart has two heights. We don't have a chart in the overlay district with two heights. So technically we don't need this in here because it doesn't apply. I think it should apply, though. I think it should apply because we could end up with a six-story high building backing on, you know, a one-story high or a two-story high building with very little space, 20, 25 feet between them. And we intend to change the height buffer. Either this town meeting or next town meeting. I don't think we can do it this town meeting, but we'll get to that. We'll get to that. So I would prefer to keep, to instead say the height buffer area does apply to six-story buildings in the overlay district. So it would, if written out in conventional two-height form, it would be six and five. Or five and six, yeah. That's fine. So you're saying it only applies to six-story buildings? Well, Steve suggested five and six. Well, no, so the height buffer would apply to the sixth floor but not the fifth floor. Sixth floor, yeah. So essentially a six-story building. Yeah. Now, I know that could be a little bit of a disincentive for somebody to build a sixth floor, and I'm concerned about that. But for me, the overriding thing is we have this height buffer in the regs, in the bylaw already, that affects a lot of the buildings along Mass Avenue and Broadway, or theoretically could, once they get above four stories. Because that's usually the code of four-story or six-story. And I would prefer that we figure out what to do with the height buffer regulate bylaw rather than jerry-rig something here. That's my feeling anyhow. And I think, Ken, this also addresses, I know you wanted to circle back to the way that buildings address, excuse me, let me speak into the mic. I know that you wanted to address the way that buildings interact with a residential parcel behind them. So this would be one vehicle for doing that. So a six-story building, it applies for a six-story building adjacent to a residential building, a residential zone, which right now. That's in essence what the. Essentially, that doesn't happen. Because we only allow six-story buildings on primary quarters here, and adjacent neighborhoods are max now of what? Four stories now or three stories? I don't know what. Three stories. So this thing will never happen. No, it could happen on Mass Ave. There are some that do not have. So that's what I'm saying. If there is a residential house on Mass Ave. This one, this one. Look at all of these that don't have any neighborhood parcel behind them. Those are on Broadway, and those are no longer six-story buildings. And Mass Ave. Here, here, here, here. That's just in East Arlington. So in effect, a question for Mr. Benson, you would be keeping the buffer areas that are in the bylaw, so 200-foot. Until we fix them. Yeah, 200-foot northerly, 100-foot southerly, and 150 feet on the other two sides. Do you have a suggestion? Before your suggestion, and we'll get to this later, the problem I have with going from 200 to something else is we don't have any . . . how do you get to something else? Yeah, we can talk about that when we get to whatever article that is. Right, right. Okay. Okay. The next was the underlying district versus the . . . We already talked about that, the overlay district. Ken, you wanted to talk about how we turn the corner on stepbacks. Yep. What would you like to discuss there? Well, on a corner lot, two sides are considered fronts. One's primary, one's secondary. And then the other two sides of our property are considered side yard setbacks. On a corner lot, there are no rear setback. So when you turn the corner from primary to a secondary front yard, and then that goes along, the setback on that side at the end of that road is only five feet. And let's say if it's residential, I mean, sorry, if it's commercial and it happens to be retail or whatever that fits into your category there, there's a zero lot setback there. So that comes out all the way to the front there, and then it's a five-yard setback. Yeah, setback. And then there might be a residential house or a two-family house or a three-family house on the next property over. So that's where the reduced height buffer applies. That's where my question is right now, because if that's the case, then if it's 100 feet, now that pushes that building way up the other side, and now you're pretty far away. Which is why we need to fix the reduced height buffer. Yes, but that's limiting what we're trying to do here on the MBTA. I completely understand. Regarding corner lots, the definition for our bylaw, granted, does not make this easy to understand. Correct. The definition for lot line rear goes on to say that in the case of a corner lot, the owner shall have the option of choosing which of the two lot lines that are not front lot lines is to be considered a rear lot line. So I read it as you have two fronts, you get to pick what the rear is, and then the rest is the side. Now, it's a little messier when you have three fronts. In that case, you have the rear as a side and there is no rear. But I think that's what it says. That's what it says, yes. All right. I thought I interpreted it differently. If I did, then that's. Are you good? Yeah, why don't we just table that?  Okay. All right. Section E-2, there was the, where was the word additional, Steve, that needed to be added? So it was actually after the word additional. Story. The word story. Second additional. One additional story. Yes. All right. I'm sorry. It may just be that I'm tired. Where does it need to be? Show me where this needs to go. Story. Thank you very much.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 414</summary>

> Okay. It's the second additional. I was looking at the first. Thank you. I had story after second additional. Okay. And let me see. F1 and F4 we already addressed. Just to confirm how it came out. So since we settled on a minimum parking of one space and TDM, I think we keep four. I think F4 is the one that we keep. But in F1, the last sentence for business uses, no off street parking is required for the non-residential space. I think we keep that part two. And then we construct the first two lines of F1. That will work. And again, we're editing that to say developments under this section are encouraged to provide fewer parking spaces than what is required under the provisions of section 6.1.5. No, 6.1. 6.1.5 is the parking reduction. And we need both. Because one is the minimum and one is the reduction. We need four and one. You just need to say 6.1. We didn't talk about that. Sorry. No, no, no. When I said removing the first two lines is F1, not removing. F2 is perfectly fine. We should keep that. So we're removing the first two lines of one. We're replacing those with the requirement to follow 6.1. And adding to it the number four. So basically condensing one and four into a single. That's fine. Okay. And then Ken wanted to add in discussing bonuses for the neighborhood multifamily. We're doing that right? It's not in here currently. Unless I missed. It hasn't been in there. The bonuses have only been on Broadway and NASA. So there's no bonus in Broadway right now. No, there's bonus on Broadway and NASA. There's no bonus in the neighborhood multifamily district. Okay. Yep. You're correct. I'm sorry. Okay. We're good. All right. So that brings us anything else on Article 12? Nothing here. Ken? No. So we're going to go and I don't mind approving it in a whole, but there's certain sections that I'm going to object to. I understand. And we'll leave it at that. I understand. Okay. So what I will do is run through the list of changes that I have written down here. If I miss any, please let me know. I will, Ken, identify those which you do not agree with, if that works for you. And again, just raise your hand or let me know if I, if I miss one or if I mischaracterize one, please.

> Okay. Thank you. So the modifications, so I'm going to phrase this in the form of a motion so that I don't have to restate this yet again. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action on Article 12 MBTA communities overlay district with the following amendments? Reduce the NMF max height to three stories, knowing that Ken is not dissents on this one. Three stories and 36 feet. Thank you. 36 feet or 35. What is, what is it? The current regs are 35, 35. Thank you. Apply current off street parking requirements of 6.1, including reductions per 6.15 with Ken in Ken as dissenting. We also discussed, although this will not be in the, um, well, I'll not put that in motion. Um, we will combine, uh, F one and four into a single item under off street parking under height options. We are going to accept, uh, alternate to as proposed for the Arlington Heights section of the map. I thought it was to a or something like that, wasn't it? I think there were only two options. I think it was one. Please correct me if I'm wrong. You could be right. Believe it. Yeah, they're labeled alternative one and alternative to alternative one. Sorry, I got it all. Sheets. That's okay. I'm sorry, Claire. You said there was a two and a two way. No, I'm sorry. Just two. Okay, so we're good on alternative to correct. Okay. Um, we are modifying.

Three a to exclude parcels on Mass Ave from Orvis to Alewife Brook Parkway, with the exception with the additional, um, modification of, uh, including one additional parcel in the NMF district on the north side from Winter to Henderson and on the south side from Lake to Fairmont. And I'm rejecting that. Okay. And with the removal of, um, can I see that map that I marked up? Just count the number of parcels. Oh, uh, with the removal of 345678. Um, eight small parcels identified on the map exhibit. Keep that.

> Thank you. Okay, I'm gonna know that, too. I've got, you know, on the whole thing. Okay. Okay. Uh, let's see. So the next item is, um, we are accepting Gene's recommendation for modifications to Section 5.9.1C with regard to, um, how to deal with projects in and out of the overlay district. And adding for the, that was for the second sentence. Right. In the first sentence, we are adding, um, for a maximum of one parcel depth into the NMF. Yep. And Ken, you were not in agreement on that one either, correct? No, I wasn't. I changed my mind when you said that one parcel. Okay. Is allowed to go one parcel. Okay. Okay, great. Um, the next item we are doing is, um, we are not going to be adding the street trees. That's going, we're going to be addressing that in Article 10. And, and, yeah, we can come back if we can come back and amend this vote if we need to. The next item is we are adding Section 6.4 to apply to the MBMF for the solar roof requirements. And Ken, you are in support or not in support of that one? I'm not in support of that one. Okay. Just because it's the same as the trees. Solar roof requirement in the MBMF. Yes, that's what I have.

> Thank you. And then the MBMF residential is the residential slash business sign district. The MBMF mixed use is the business sign district. Okay. Thumbs up. Uh, for the, we're modifying the bonus relative to, uh, green building requirements to read that a minimum of LEED gold certified or equivalent level of alternate green building standard as reviewed and approved by the redevelopment board is the, uh, bonus requirement related to green building standards. We are adding the, to the purpose statement 5.9.2 to add, uh, to encourage environmental and climate protection, sensitive development in Section 5.9.4.10. We are removing the first sentence and moving the second and third sentences to the district chart in number 12. We are also removing the word public from the descriptor of art. We are, uh, adding the provision in the, uh, mixed use bonus provision that, uh, for the additional two floors, no residences shall, um, be included on the first floor and that, uh, the, uh, business uses shall be eating and drinking establishments, business services, childcare, and retail. Noting that Ken is in dissent on this one. Yes. Thank you. For the yard and minimums chart on 5.9.4.D12, we are adding minimum, the word minimum to front side and rear setbacks. And did you want to add yard? Yeah, yard. And add the word yard. Thank you. We are also updating the, um, side yard setbacks for the NMF to indicate that where there is one side yard, the minimum is five feet. Um, and with the two side, or excuse me, for, um, the NMF, uh, the total is 20, 20 feet for the, uh, side setbacks with a minimum of five feet on, on one side. Or one side minimum of five feet, two sides minimum 20 feet total. Yes. Yes. Correct. Uh, we are adding some Scrivener's notes with regard to capitalization in sections 5.9 and 5.93. We are, uh, adding the requirement to comply with step back standards in 5.3.17. We are, uh, uh, correcting 5.9.4.D5 traffic visibility to indicate that it applies to the NMF district, not the MBMF district. Applies only to the. Only in the NMFF district, yes. Correct. In section 5.9.4.D8, we are identifying that the height buffer area shall apply, uh, to the sixth floor. And Ken, you are not in agreement with that one, correct? No, I'm okay with the sixth floor.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 233</summary>

> You're okay with that one? Yep. Okay. Um, and in section E2, we are adding story after the additional, or after the second, uh, word additional. Did I miss anything? No, I just want to ask Claire something. Are you okay with that? Steve? Uh, I think you've covered it. Okay. Ken? I'm just asking Claire a question. Sure, of course. We'll hold, and then I will ask for someone to make the motion. That's fine. She said that's fine. Okay. Um, so do I hear, uh, someone to make that motion for, uh, favorable action with the previously stated amendments for Article 12? I'll so move. Is there a second? Second. We'll take a vote, starting with Gene. Yes. Ken?  Yes. Steve? Yes. And I'm a yes as well. So we, Redevelopment Board has recommended favorable action with, uh, stated amendments for Article 12. Okay. Nine more to go. Let's head over to Article 3. By the way, thank you all. I know that that was a lot to get through. Um, I appreciate everybody working so hard to get through all of these this evening. So thank you. You too, Rachel. Thank you. Apologize for my stubbornness. You know, it's, it's important that we feel like we can all express our, um, opinions freely and honestly and respect each other's point of views. So I appreciate you bringing those up.

> Okay. Excuse me one second while I pull this up. You don't want me to go through these? That would be great. It should hopefully be faster. Article 3 was the exact same as last time. It just, um, corrects a reference. Should we vote on these individually? Yes, we're going to vote on them individually. Um, Ken, any questions on Article 3? No. Uh, Steve? No questions. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action for Article 3? So moved. Second? Second. I'll take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Ken? Yes. Steve? Yes. And I'm a yes as well. I have a vote of 4 to 0 for Article 3.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Article 4</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 330</summary>

> Next is Article 4. All right. So when we last saw Article 4, there was a scrivener's error and the wrong warrant article wording was there. So we thought we couldn't do anything. This has the correct warrant article wording, um, that was presented. Um, I didn't make any change in the reduced height buffer area. Um, so that wording is the same as it carried over from last year sometime. Um, my feeling about it is that because the article wording says we'll vote to update to define finding, it's not within the scope to change the height distances here. And I don't know how we would determine what a better height distance is without some discussion and looking at what the options are. So that would be my first thing. I don't think it's within the scope to change the height and we haven't had a discussion about how to change the height. And my second is I don't see how the new wording is particularly better than the old wording. I'd prefer to do no action and go back to town meeting with a complete package that includes new wording if we want any and lower heights. So that's where I am on this. Steve? Yeah. Um, in terms of heights or in terms of the actual buffer areas, the best suggestion I could do is note that, you know, the heights were, maximum heights were larger when this was written and just simply scale the triangle down. I agree that it would be worthwhile to actually spend time looking at it. So I'm inclined not to want to do too much, do anything with it this year. Kim? Same here. Great. And I agree. I think we did take a look at this. We had not yet come to consensus. We had several different options that we were considering, and I think that taking a little bit more time to review those together would be helpful.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 33</summary>

> So is there a motion to recommend no action on Article 4? So moved. Second. Let's take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Kim? Yes. Steve? Yes. And I'm a yes as well.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Article 5</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 5</summary>

> Let's move to Article 5.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 152</summary>

> Article 5, if you look at the definitions, the only thing I changed was the underlying wording that starts with the word except to make it clear that the change only applied in the business districts because that's what we had talked about doing and was in the warrant. Let me see if there was anything else that I changed. You scratched out Section D. Well, I scratched out Section D before. Section D was unnecessary because I slightly rewrote Section C. So it says in all districts except the business district. are calculated on gross floor area for business district, see the note. If you look at the note at the end of B5, you would delete the word and in the second line after the word space. That was an error. And that's the note. So those are the changes since we saw it last time. Great. Any discussion? Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 165</summary>

> Yes, I have one request and one concern. So as far as a request go, for context I would suggest including the definition of open space in addition to the ones for landscaped and usable. My reasoning is that, and I'm saying this as a town meeting member, I don't believe, I feel like town meeting doesn't quite have its head around open space as defined in our bylaw. And we saw some of that in the comments where people would assume it would meant public space or it meant green space and it's a defined term in the bylaw. It means something completely different. So my first suggestion is to include the definition of open space for context. My second, my one concern, my concern is that the topic of balconies and rooftops is especially not well understood by town meeting. And I was wondering how members of the board felt about leaving the definitions as they are and just making the dimensional changes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 177</summary>

> Ken? I don't know. You got me there. I did not know that that was going to come up. I do agree with you. We need to do better explaining what we mean by open space or what open space means, not what we mean. At the last meeting, people were thinking that open space allowed cars to park in a parking yard and so forth like that. And I don't believe that's the case. It was made fairly clear by the building commissioner that parking a car in the back yard has different regulations. It's under the driveways. Zoning ordinance, not this. So I think making it much, much clearer is the way to go. And if we can't do that for this article here, it's going to end up like what happened in the last meeting. So my question is can we get something to better define this or otherwise let's table it for the next meeting. Because we'll be bringing up the same stuff again and I think the result will be the same.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 290</summary>

> Gene? I think it's a good idea to add the definition of open space here. I mean, we're not going to amend it. But just to add, to give some more context, I don't understand what you're proposing, Steve, if we take the except pieces out of the definitions, where would you put them to have the same effect? So in other words, I'm proposing that we not change that part. So I know you, I don't agree with the no more than ten feet above any limited or any, you know, the lowest occupied story for residential use. But my concern is I've seen town meeting get kind of caught up on that or it's been a point of, you know, it's been a point of surprise where, you know, where they'll see this and they'll say why are we allowing it on, why are we allowing open space on balconies? Well, it's been in the bylaw for the last 50 years. But this is not something that's well understood. So if we took those out, the only thing that this would do is change how you calculate the dimensional requirements in the business district to be based on lot area. Yeah. So I believe that, so section D, which is marked as strike out would stay, struck out. And yes, we would be changing the way that the dimensional is calculated. So we keep D struck out, we'd amend C, and then we'd add the note at the end of that. That's been a huge challenge for us, though, dealing with this ten foot. I mean, to me, that's the most important part of this entire process. Well, there is, I'm raising it as a point of concern.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 482</summary>

> I understand. You know, it's not something that we're, I would not oppose the definition changes that are suggested. Gene. I agree. It's a, it's a, it's, it's a challenge. I agree. It's a, it's a, it's something that, well, let me just preface it by saying quite a number of the comments that I got, and I think all of us got on MBTA communities, either said directly or implied that they thought that open space was not open space owned by the owner of the property, but public open space. So, you know, if I have a 15 yard setback on my front yard, it's public space, according to what quite a number of people said. And so, their concern about the setbacks were, well, I won't have access to that space anymore. So, I know that's a problem, and I know it's difficult, and I know this has come up before. I just sort of feel like, and I know this will require two thirds vote to pass down a meeting, I feel like we can make a good case about why this makes a lot of sense. And maybe we can even find for the, for the display about this, pictures of a couple of those buildings you can see in Europe that have greenery all over the front coming off the balconies, you know, because people look at those and say, wow, that's great. Or, you know, look at like the biophilic cities website, and it's full of a lot of that. So, I agree with you, Steve, but I guess I just feel like how long are we going to be gun shy about this?  Okay. No, that's fair. I think we need to have the conversation. As long as, although it's not readily apparent from the draft amendment, you know, but when we do the final report, I hope that it clearly shows that, you know, the text about rooftops and balconies is in the bylaw, because it's there. That it's already there. Yes, that it's already there. Yeah, I mean, if people read this, they would see that, but yeah. I think that the other thing to ensure that it is highlighted is that the percentage of landscaped open space is increasing in the table in terms of what is proposed for open space. Yes, it is. For some, not all. For some. For the mixed use properties. Right. Which makes a lot of sense, because that is actual green space as opposed to usable open space, which has no requirement that it be planted or have any type of greenery whatsoever. So I think it's a net positive specifically in the mixed use properties. It could be a paved tennis court. It could be, yes. That's what the bylaw says. Yes. Okay. Are there any other changes or discussion on this item?
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 173</summary>

> I think Steve highlighted how important it will be for us to get this right as we present it to town meeting. So I can share that I, this weekend, put together a list of potential graphics that I thought would be helpful, and in this one specifically, I think, illustrating how unfortunately with usable open space tied to the building square footage, how that increases as the building height increases as opposed to being tied to the lot line actually reduces the percentage of commercial space that we can have on the, you know, less than 4% of, you know, space that's devoted to business districts in the town, and that, again, by increasing the landscape open space, we're actually, we can visually show that we are increasing the amount of space devoted to that is specifically identified to be devoted to green space as opposed to usable open space, which has no explicit requirement for that. So if you are in agreement that those illustrations are helpful, that's what I'd suggested.

No comments. Steve? Nothing here. Okay.

> Sorry. Let me get to that. Too many windows open. I apologize. So again, because we need to put this into the board report here, this is really around the simplification and the application of the setback, excuse me, based on the distance off of the parcel behind the lot rather than the length of the parallel wall. Right. Both the distance and the height of the building. Correct. So it's much saner than it was before. Exactly. More predictable and to Ken's point, understandable and again, predictable in terms of the distance. I would also add contact sensitive. Contact sensitive. Yes. That's exactly the right phrase.

> Great. Is there a motion to vote favorable action for to recommend favorable action for article 6? So moved. Is there a second? Second. Is there a second? Yes. Gene? Yes. Steve?  Yes. And I'm a yes as well. We will recommend favorable action for article 6. Article 7. 7. All right. So I did make a change in this. When we had the discussion last time, Ken wanted to keep the setback on the fifth floor. So I moved it to the fourth floor. And that's the only change that I made in this. So it now says for buildings in excess of three stories in height, the stepback provides on the fourth floor. Rest of the same principle facade presumed can be changed by us. I added what Steve suggested, stepback requirements should not apply to buildings in the industrial zones. And that's it. Great. Any discussion? Starting with Ken?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 29</summary>

> I'm going to vote no for this. Do you want to talk about? I still believe that the setback should be on the fifth floor, not the fourth floor.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 119</summary>

> Okay. Steve?  Nothing further here. Nothing here. And I am also in support of this one. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action for article 7? So moved. Is there a second? Second. We'll take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Ken? No. Steve? I think it's important in the report that it's made clear that the no vote wanted a higher stepback. Yes, I have that in my notes here. Claire, we'll just need to make sure we note that. We don't have to say it was Ken. Yeah, typically we just identify the. Right. All right. Article 8. No changes from the last time we saw it. And this is height and story minimums. Steve?

> So I recall seeing an earlier version where there were dimensional tables involved, and it looks like we're just putting in a paragraph, rather. Yeah, after going through the dimensional tables, I said to myself, this is crazy. We just need to put this in this particular section. I think that's a nice way to do it. Just wanted to make sure there was nothing missing. No, nothing missing. That disappeared the previous time. Yeah. Great. Ken? I'm supportive of this. And are driving home the fact that in, again, the less than 4% of land that is zoned for business, that we're incentivizing a more intensive and valuable land use on these properties. Anything else to add? I was going to say, I am also supportive. And, yeah, this, to me, this is, you know, the motivation of this and several of the other articles is to encourage higher value redevelopment that produces more tax revenue for the town and hopefully ideally would lead to fewer overrides or smaller overrides.

> Thank you, Steve. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action for article 8? So moved. Is there a second?  Second. I'll take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. Steve. Yes. I'm a yes as well. We are recommending favorable action with a vote of 4-0. And article 9. There was no change since the last time you saw this. As we pointed out last time, we have the authority under a section of the bylaw to modify or waive the front yard, the corner lot depths. And so this just makes it easier for somebody who's coming in to understand how this works. Thank you. Any comment? Yes. I think it is an accurate way of codifying the board's interpretation of section 5.3.16. Great. Thank you. Ken. No, I think this ties in with the previous article about adjacent heights of different buildings. Great. Great. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action for article 9? So moved. Is there a second? Second. I'll take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. Steve. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. We'll recommend favorable action as a vote of 4-0. Next is street trees. Street trees. All right. The one difference is we're going to add something. We'll say in the business, residential, and multifamily housing overlay district. In the business district, residential district, and multifamily housing overlay district. And then the rest will be the same. And that will be the only change from the last time you saw it. Except at some point I added the word Arlington in front of the word redevelopment board. Great. Thank you, Gene. Ken. Any commentary? Nope. None here. Steve.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 121</summary>

> Yes. I recall the intent of this being to encourage street trees anytime there was redevelopment. And here we're limiting it to things under review of the ARB and the ZBA. So that takes a big chunk of the town out of the picture. All right. So I want to answer that. But there was something else I meant to do and I didn't. If you look at administration, it should say section we can't say section 9X because we don't know if that's going to get passed. And so I think we should say and site plan review. So even if it doesn't get passed, we still have it in here. So I would change that to site plan review.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 218</summary>

> Well, here's the thing. My understanding was and based on conversations we had from Arlington green streets that we were going to make it a requirement for street trees the same way we did previously for commercial buildings. But right now there's a whole there are some ways that you don't need to put a street tree. Like if the street trees are already there. if the utility lines are in the way, et cetera, et cetera. So when it was just the redevelopment board doing it for site plan for EDR, we could do that. But under this, there are gonna be times where it's in front of the ZBA, times when it's in front of us, and times when it might be in front of neither of us. Let's say it's just a regular single family house going up somewhere. So the way we attempted to deal with this is if it's in front of the ZBA for some reason, and it could be, then they will determine whether they're going to allow some of the changes. If it's where there's no other suitable thing, if it's just a single family home that's not subject to ARB or ZBA, then the planning department administratively can make that decision. So my concern is in the applicability section.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 106</summary>

> Okay. So I'm reading in the business and residential districts and the multifamily overlay district, new construction additions over 50% of the existing footprint, or redevelopment subject to review by the Arlington Redevelopment Board or Zoning Board. Okay, oh, okay. Just to toss an idea out, and please let me know what you think. I'm wondering how my colleagues would feel about striking the words subject to review by the Arlington Redevelopment Board or Zoning Board of Appeals. So that, you know, it would apply to new construction additions over 50% of the existing footprint or redevelopment. That makes perfect sense to me. Point blank, yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 ? - 45</summary>

> The first time I read this, it took, well, I'll just say it took several times for that extra or to creep in, or it seemed like it would have excluded things that were just going to inspectional services for a plain old building permit.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 125</summary>

> Yeah, that makes sense. I'm just working through whether there's any scenarios. I'm not immediately thinking of where we could encourage additional tree planting, but that seems to make sense to me. I think that's fair. I mean, if you pull a permit to build, you do your bathroom, I don't want to be planting a tree. Okay, that makes sense. So we will strike in 6.3.2 or subject to review by the Arlington Redevelopment Board or the Zoning Board of Appeals. And then in 6.3.3, we'll strike and section 9.X and say, and site plan review. I meant to do that and forgot. 6.3.9. Because we don't know if section 9 is going to pass. Yes, I have that one in there too, Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 9</summary>

> Okay. Yeah, site plan review instead of 9.X. Right.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 105</summary>

> Yeah, okay. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action with the proposed amendments? So moved. Is there a second? The modified amendment, right? We wouldn't have to say modified or? Yes, as modified. As modified. Yes. Yeah, she said that. No, sorry. It's okay. Didn't hear that. I'll say it again. Nope, I'll second it. Okay, we'll take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. Steve. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. It's getting very late for me. Oh my gosh. Not only you. Favorable action was recommended on street trees. Article 11, residential in the business districts. Gene, take it away.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 72</summary>

> I didn't make any changes from the last time you saw it. If you saw an earlier draft, there might have been tables and tables and tables, but after thinking about it, I realized we only needed to change the use table to make this happen. So that's all we've done. And then the district and purpose, and the reason I changed the district and purpose is because the purpose is changing.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 92</summary>

> Thank you, Gene. Ken, any questions or comments? We're on. Residential uses in the business districts. Okay, no. Steve? No questions or comments. And I am also in favor of this article. Is there a motion to recommend favorable action on article 11? So moved. Is there a second? I'll second. We'll take a vote starting with Gene. Yes. Ken? Yes. Steve? Yes. And I'm a yes as well. We will recommend favorable action for article 11. All right, in the absence of any other articles, that closes agenda item number two.

<details><summary>Adjourn</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 23</summary>

> We'll now go to agenda item number three, which is to review our meeting schedule. Claire, I will hand it over to you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 143</summary>

> Great. Great, thank you. Currently, we are scheduled to meet on October the 10th to approve the ARB report as I'm sure amended and edited by members of this board. We also are currently scheduled to meet on October the 16th, although the chair will not be in attendance at that meeting. The question is, is whether or not the board would like to meet on Monday, October 23rd, which would be prior to town meeting. We've done this in the past where we've met in the conference room for about an hour before town meeting and then adjourned to town meeting. If that is something the board wishes to do on the 23rd, we can schedule, I can certainly schedule some items for an agenda. If the board does not wish to meet on that day, that is perfectly fine too. Kim?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 49</summary>

> I'd like to keep the meeting on October 23rd, just schedule this so that if we need to do some talking points prior to town meeting, we have the ability to do so and make any, you know, little last minute tweaks just as a precursor for the meeting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 102</summary>

> I'll actually just add to that before I go to my colleagues, now that you've brought that up. One of the things, if there are amendments, for example, that are proposed for articles we have not yet heard, we have often found it helpful to be able to have a discussion and thoughtfully weigh in on support or reservations we might have about some of the proposed amendments. So I would agree with Ken in thinking about it in that terms, it makes some sense to keep it on in case we need it. Great, sounds good. Steve, any thoughts on that?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 26</summary>

> No, I agree that it's useful to have a meeting scheduled before town meeting to tie up loose ends and talk about things that need discussion.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 313</summary>

> Gene? I agree. If we can meet in that little room and annex. Yeah, we can meet in the DPCD conference room. Right, then we don't have to walk far. Exactly. All right, any other questions on agenda item number three, which is the meeting schedule? Ready for number four. Okay, is there a motion to adjourn? So motion. Can I just say something before we adjourn? I know there are only like maybe two people here or four people here from the working group. I just wanna say that I think you guys did terrific work. I really appreciate all the time and effort and the report, which was just wonderful. I know we made some changes to what you recommended, but I know you understood that that was part of this iterative process that we're going through. So, you know, I just wanted to say thanks to you two. Thank you. Who were involved in this. The whole department. Yeah. Yeah, for all the work. And also to the members of the public, we received a lot of outreach. It was all read, every single word. Every one. And we really appreciate it all. Before we take a motion to adjourn, I would like to offer to do another sort of like build out analysis, similar to what, you know, what I provide, once we have a new compliance model. Yes. If that would be useful for reporting. And I can turn that around fairly quickly once I have the spreadsheets. That would be fantastic. Okay. Thank you. Well, then my offer stands. Thank you. Any other items before we adjourn? All right, is there a motion to adjourn? So motion. There's a second. We'll take a vote starting with Jean. Yes. Ken. Yes. Steve. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. Thank you all, this meeting is adjourned. Thank you.
