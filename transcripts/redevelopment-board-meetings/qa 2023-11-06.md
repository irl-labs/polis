> The discussion concerning the proposed hotel at 1207-1211 Mass Ave involved the developer, Jim Doherty, and the board members. 

Jim Doherty, the owner of the property, defended his request for an extension of the special permit for the project. He explained that the hospitality industry was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which delayed progress on the project. He stated that he had not yet secured an operator for the hotel and that he would not commit to a restaurant operator until the hotel operator was selected. Doherty also expressed frustration with the lack of progress and communication with the board. He emphasized his commitment to the project and his willingness to work with the board.

The board members, including Ken, Gene, and Steve, expressed varying views on the extension request. Ken was supportive of a two-year extension, but requested a progress report after one year. Gene was uncertain about granting a two-year extension and suggested that the project should comply with all current zoning laws. Steve agreed with Ken's suggestion for a one-year progress report and also suggested that the project should comply with the tree planting bylaw. The chair, Rachel Zember, expressed concern about the lack of progress on the project and the state of the site. She suggested that a two-year extension might be too long.

> The tone of the discussion was tense and contentious. The board members expressed frustration and skepticism about the lack of progress on the project. For example, one board member said, "I'm concerned that no progress has been made and that two-year extension is too long and there is too long to go if we offer an extension at all." Another board member expressed disappointment, saying, "It's disappointing to me to see that there has not been progress on this site." Jim Doherty, the project owner, defended his position, stating, "I'm here to discuss it with the board and hopefully we all share the goal of it was a vibrant project back then and I think it still is." He also expressed frustration with the board's demands, saying, "I'm glad, finally, I get to respond. It doesn't sound like anybody wants to hear my response." The discussion ended in a deadlock, with the board unable to reach a consensus on whether to extend the permit.
