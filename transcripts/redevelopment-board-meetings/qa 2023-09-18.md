> The Redevelopment Board meeting on September 18th, 2023, was called to order by Chair Rachel Zemberi. Other members present were Steve Rubbelock, Eugene Benson, Ken Lowe, and Director of Planning and Community Development, Claire Ricker. The meeting began with introductions and a discussion about the lack of microphone projection in the room. The board then moved to the public hearing for docket number 3766351 Broadway, where the applicant presented their plans for a new sign for Thai Moon restaurant. Claire Ricker provided an overview on behalf of the Department of Planning and Community Development. The board members then had the opportunity to ask questions and provide comments. The meeting continued with a discussion about the upcoming meeting schedule, with a decision to add a meeting on October 10th to review and approve the ARB report to town meeting. The meeting concluded with a discussion on zoning by-law amendments for corner lot requirements. The meeting was then adjourned.

> Docket #3766 351 Broadway is a public hearing for a proposed sign at Thai Moon restaurant. The sign is internally illuminated and requires a special permit due to its nature of being channel letters. The sign is proposed to be 10 feet long by two feet high and will attach to the existing structure. The letters are opaque, fabricated from aluminum with lights inside, creating a halo effect against the wall. The sign is seeking relief to exceed the maximum width for signage in the area and may also need relief on the 60 percent rule related to storefront signage.

Board member Ken Lowe expressed no issues with the sign being internally lit and felt the design fits well with the rest of the neighborhood. He was undecided on the size of the sign. Eugene Benson sought clarification on how the sign would be lit and had no further questions after the explanation. Steve Rubbelock pointed out that the proposed sign width seemed to exceed the maximum allowed width by seven inches, which was confirmed by the board. Rachel Zemberi, the Chair of the Redevelopment Board, suggested that the size of the sign could be further discussed after public comment.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article B Open Space in Business Districts.</summary>

> Article B proposes changes to the definition and requirements of open space in business districts. The changes include allowing open spaces such as balconies and roofs to be considered as open space without height restrictions. The proposal also suggests removing the requirement for usable open space for some parts of the business district, arguing that such spaces do not necessarily have to be green and can be restrictive for buildings. The article also proposes changes to the calculation of landscaped open space and usable open space based on lot area. The changes are intended to encourage green space in and around buildings in business districts.
</details><details><summary>Please, predict a reasonable warrant article for Article B Open Space in Business Districts from the discussion by the board.</summary>

> The board discussed Article B, which pertains to the definition and requirements of open space in business districts. The proposal suggests that balconies and roofs could be considered as open space, and the height restriction for such spaces would be removed. This would potentially allow for more green space on buildings. The board also discussed the removal of the requirement for usable open space for some parts of the business district, arguing that it doesn't necessarily have to be green space and could be pavement or asphalt. However, there were concerns raised about the public's access to these spaces, as there is no requirement for the spaces to be open to the public. The board decided to further discuss the proposal, particularly the aspect of variable rear yard setbacks, before making a final decision.
</details><details><summary>Please, list who spoke during the public comment period for Open Space in Business Districts and summarize what each said.</summary>

> 1. Laurel Kane, 79 Westmoreland Ave: She expressed difficulty in understanding the complex language of the proposal and suggested that illustrations or pictures could help make it more accessible to the public.

2. Aram Holman, 12 Whittemore Street: He opposed the proposal, arguing that it would be a disservice to people on side streets as it limits the setback to only one side of the building.

3. Chris Loretti, 56 Adams Street: He also opposed the proposal, stating that the stepbacks should remain on both sides of the building and start at the fourth floor. He argued that this change would be particularly detrimental to buildings on side streets, which often have longer street frontages.

4. Kristen Anderson, 12 Up on Road West: She asked the board to encourage more outdoor seating for cafes and restaurants, given the increased outdoor congregation due to the pandemic.

5. Carl Wagner, Edge Hill Road resident: He argued that the proposal was one of the 2019 density articles that were rejected by the town meeting and the people of Arlington. He stated that the proposal was being rushed through without adequate public meetings and awareness.

6. Joanne Cullinane, 69 Newland Road: She echoed the sentiments of previous speakers, expressing concern about the reduction of green space in the town.

7. Ratnakar Valanki, 21 Adams Street: He spoke in support of the article, arguing that rooftops and balconies should be considered open space and that the town needs to move along with the times.

8. Matt Miller, 42 Columbia Road, Arlington: He questioned the accessibility of rooftop green spaces and expressed concerns about overpopulation and the impact on schools.

9. Elizabeth Carr-Jones, 1 Lehigh Street, Arlington: She expressed concerns about the elimination of open space requirements for certain properties in the business districts and the potential impact on community spaces.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article C REAR YARD SETBACKS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS.</summary>

> Article C proposes changes to the rear yard setbacks in business districts. The changes were suggested by Kelly and include three options: a variable rear yard setback, no setback at all, or a standard length setback regardless of the size of the building. The variable option was chosen for discussion as it was deemed the most interesting. This option would make the setbacks variable depending on what's behind the building. For example, if it's just an alleyway, it's one thing. If it's a tall building and it abuts a residential, it's a bigger setback. If it's an even taller building, it's a bigger setback. The aim is to make the setbacks more responsive to what's in back and what's the size of the building.
</details><details><summary>Please, list who spoke during the public comment period for REAR YARD SETBACKS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS and summarize what each said.</summary>

> 1. Elizabeth Carr-Jones: She expressed concern about roadway visibility issues, especially around corners that are narrower and built up. She asked if this change would affect visibility and safety.

2. Carl Wagner: He expressed strong opposition to the proposal, stating that it was not given enough time for public input and discussion. He suggested that the proposal be pushed to a spring town meeting for further discussion and input.

3. Aram Holman: He echoed Wagner's sentiments, stating that the proposal was difficult to understand and needed more public debate. He also suggested that the board create visuals to help the public understand the proposal.

4. Chris Loretti: He expressed concern that the proposal would eviscerate the height buffer and suggested that the board should be more transparent if they want to get rid of height buffer areas. He also pointed out that the board already has the power to waive the height buffer area on a case-by-case basis.

5. Kristen Anderson: She expressed her support for the proposal, stating that the town has supported more people and vehicles in the past. She suggested that traffic and other concerns should not be a major issue.

6. Elizabeth Carr-Jones: She asked for clarification on how the proposal would affect properties that back up against these buildings, particularly in terms of snow removal and traffic.

7. Carl Wagner: He reiterated his opposition to the proposal, stating that it was being rushed and that the public deserved more time to discuss and understand it.

8. Aram Holman: He seconded Wagner's comments and suggested that the board delay the proposal to allow for more public debate and understanding.

9. Chris Loretti: He stated that the proposal was outside the scope of the article and suggested that it be scrapped and revisited in the future.

10. Miller: She expressed concern about the potential impact on traffic and suggested that this should be a consideration in the board's discussions.

11. Marker: He expressed his support for the proposal, stating that the town has supported more density in the past and should not be worried about potential traffic and other concerns.

12. Chris Loretti: He expressed strong opposition to the proposal, stating that it would do away with the height buffer area and suggested that the board be more transparent if they want to get rid of it.

13. Elizabeth Carr-Jones: She asked for clarification on how the proposal would affect properties that back up against these buildings, particularly in terms of snow removal and traffic.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article D STEP BACK REQUIREMENTS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS.</summary>

> Article D is a proposed zoning bylaw amendment related to step-back requirements in business districts. The proposal suggests that the step-back should be along the principal facade of the building and not numerous sides of the building. It also proposes that the step-back should be on the fifth floor or the fourth floor. The proposal also clarifies that for a building with street frontage on Mass Ave or Broadway, the principal facade and principal property line are presumed to be facing Mass Ave or Broadway. The proposal also suggests that the step-back requirements should be measured from the principal property line. The proposal also suggests deleting the second step-back requirement in the zoning bylaw because it is almost the same as the first one. The board members had differing opinions on whether the step-back should be on the fourth or fifth floor.
</details><details><summary>Please, list who spoke during the public comment period for Article D STEP BACK REQUIREMENTS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS and summarize what each said.</summary>

> 1. Aram Holman: Aram expressed his disagreement with the proposal, stating that the original setback should be provided along all building elevations, not just one side of the building. He felt that limiting this to only Mass Ave or Broadway would be a disservice to people on the side streets.

2. Laurel Cain: Laurel commented on the complexity of the topic and suggested that illustrations or pictures could be used to make the information more accessible and understandable to the public.

3. Chris Loretty: Chris argued that the stepbacks should remain on all street frontages, not just one, and should start at the fourth floor as originally intended. He felt that most residents in town do not want five-story buildings on Mass Ave and Broadway and that the principal facades should not be arbitrarily defined as Broadway or Mass Ave. He suggested that the bylaw change should not be made at all.

4. Carl Wagner: Carl expressed concern that Article C was being presented with no chance for public comment and changes. He felt that the ARB should reject this and push it to a spring town meeting after proper public input meetings and open forums.

5. Elizabeth Carr-Jones: Elizabeth asked for clarification on whether the only properties that would be protected with this rear setback after the change would be single-family homes. 

6. Aram Holman: Aram echoed Carl Wagner's comments, stating that there has not been an opportunity for public comment and that the proposal was very last minute. He felt that the ARB should not have the kind of discretion that the proposal would give it.

7. Chris Loretty: Chris pointed out that the proposal would adopt the Somerville zoning regulations for the rear yard setbacks for business uses. He had several issues with the proposal, including that it would mean a zero setback for things like the bike path, and that it should be based on the use of the lot adjoining the backyard rather than what the district happens to be. He suggested holding off on the proposal for now.

8. Carl Wagner: Carl felt that the public was not aware of what exactly the proposal entailed and that it was not properly presented or researched. He expressed concern that the proposal would prevent future building of single-family or two-family homes in the business districts but would not prevent large developers from doing mixed use. He asked the ARB to vote no action on this and push it to a spring town meeting.

9. Matt Miller: Matt agreed with Carl Wagner's comments and stated that there should be a reason for such a change in the regulation. He felt that the people of Arlington should understand the reason for the change.

10. Chris Loretty: Chris described the article as ahistorical and stated that the B1 district is predominantly one and two-family houses. He did not see any need to ban those homes and make them nonconforming and questioned how often new one and two-family homes are being constructed in the B district. He felt that the proposal was burdening all those people who already own those homes.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article E REDUCED HEIGHT BUFFER AREA.</summary>

> Article E, titled "Reduced Height Buffer Area," is a proposed zoning bylaw amendment. The discussion around this article centered on the idea of adjusting the height buffer area in certain zoning districts. The height buffer area is a zoning regulation that limits the height of buildings in certain areas to prevent them from overshadowing neighboring properties. The board discussed the possibility of reducing the height buffer area, but ultimately decided to postpone the decision and further study the issue. The board felt that the current height buffer area might not be consistent with the lower building heights that have been adopted in recent years. However, they also acknowledged that any changes could have significant impacts and should be carefully considered.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article F CORNER LOT REQUIREMENTS.</summary>

> Article F, the Zoning By-law Amendment for Corner Lot Requirements, proposes that in business districts, the setbacks are the setbacks prescribed in the business district, and not the setback from farther down the street in the residential district. This is to clarify that this is the way the board has been doing this up to this point and makes it easier for everyone to understand. The amendment does not apply to single-family residential buildings due to potential interpretation issues related to regulating the interior size of a single-family residential building. The board can waive or modify this if it's infeasible.
</details><details><summary>Please, list who spoke during the public comment period for Article G HEIGHT AND STORY MINIMUMS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS and summarize what each said.</summary>

> 1. Elizabeth Cartoons, 1 Lehigh Street: She expressed concern about the restriction of flexibility in the proposed amendment. She gave an example of a greenhouse business that might want to open up in the area but would be restricted by the new regulations.

2. Carl Wagner, Precinct 15 Town Meeting Member and Edge Hill Road resident: He expressed concern that the proposed changes were not well known to business owners and renters. He suggested that the changes could result in businesses being sold and the town losing more businesses. He urged the board to delay the decision until the Spring Town Meeting to allow for more public discussion.

3. Aram Holman, 12 Whittemore Street, Town Meeting Member Precinct 6: He expressed concern that the proposed changes would give the redevelopment board too much discretion and could lead to the perception that the board is swayed by developers and not ordinary residents. He urged the board to vote no on the proposal.

4. Laurel Cain, 79 Westmoreland Ave: She expressed difficulty in understanding the complex work of the board and suggested that illustrations or pictures could be used to make the proposals more accessible for the public to understand.

5. Chris Loretty, 56 Adams Street: He expressed concern that the proposed changes would limit the setback to only one side of the building, which he felt was unfair to people on the side streets. He suggested that the stepbacks should remain on both sides of the building and start at the fourth floor.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article I RESIDENTIAL USES IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS.</summary>

> Article I proposes a change to the zoning bylaw related to residential uses in business districts. Currently, single-family and two-family homes are allowed to be built in business districts. The proposed change would make these types of homes nonconforming uses in business districts, meaning they could remain but no new ones could be built. The aim is to encourage more business properties in these districts. The change would not affect existing homes or their ability to add accessory dwelling units. The proposal also leaves the dimensional tables for these homes unchanged.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize Article J STREET TREES.</summary>

> Article J is a zoning bylaw amendment related to street trees. The amendment would require street trees in both business and residential districts for redevelopment at least every 25 linear feet of lot frontage. If it's not feasible to plant trees in the required locations, a payment can be made to a tree fund instead. The amendment also specifies who can decide if a waiver for the tree requirement is granted, depending on whether the case is under the jurisdiction of the redevelopment board, the zoning board of appeals, or the department of planning and community development.
</details><details><summary>What future meeting dates were agreed upon near the end of the board meeting?  What were the constraints, e.g. holidays.</summary>

> The board agreed to add a meeting on October 10th at 7:30 p.m. to their schedule. The constraints mentioned were that October 9th is a holiday (Indigenous Peoples Day) and that the town offices would be closed. Therefore, the agenda items for the meeting on the 10th would need to be posted on the Thursday before. They also discussed potentially having a meeting on October 23rd, but that would depend on the town meeting schedule. They also mentioned a meeting on October 2nd, during which they would need to discuss and vote on various articles.
