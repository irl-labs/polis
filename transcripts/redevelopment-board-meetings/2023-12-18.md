<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good evening and welcome to the Town of Arlington Redevelopment Board meeting on December 18th, 2023. I'd like to call this meeting to order. My name is Rachel Zemberry. I am the chair of the Redevelopment Board and if the other members could please introduce themselves. Steve Arbalach, Eugene Benson, Shayna Corman-Houston, Ken Lowe. And we also have with us tonight Claire Ricker, the director of the Department of Planning and Community Development. And Claire, would you like to introduce your new colleague who is joining us this evening? I would love to introduce my new colleague. So the new assistant director for Planning and Community Development, Sarah Suarez, is joining us this evening. This is her first Redevelopment Board meeting and we are thrilled to have her. Well welcome. We are very, very much looking forward to working with you. Congratulations. So let's go ahead and move into our first agenda item this evening. We have a packed agenda and we will move through it as quickly as we can. So the first agenda item is the review of the meeting minutes from December 4th, 2023. I will first ask if there are any revisions or corrections from any member of the board, starting with Ken. No, I have none. Shayna? No. Gene? I have none. Any changes, Madam Chair? I do not have any changes either. Is there a motion to approve the meeting minutes as submitted? So motioned. Second. Great, thanks. We'll take a roll call vote, starting with Steve. Yes. Gene? Yes. Shayna? Yes. Ken? Yes. And I'm a yes as well. Those meeting minutes have been approved.</blockquote>

    * 7:35 pm The Board will review and vote to approve meeting minutes for December 4, 2023.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. So these are two proposed warrant articles that have been vetted by the Conservation Commission to be progressed by DPCD and potentially the ARB warrant articles for zoning. One is related to the inland wetland district overlay and the other is a proposal for rezoning open space, which I think is an item the board was interested in looking at anyway. So I'd like to introduce David Morgan, who's our environmental planner and conservation agent, and he will walk us through the proposed warrant articles. Fantastic. Thank you. And thank you, David. Steve, if I could ask you to please relocate that microphone, and if you and Gene wouldn't mind sharing, that would be fantastic. David, do you have any other guests that have joined you this evening? I'm Chuck Taroni, vice chair of the Conservation Commission. Great. Thank you. Great. And we'd love it if you could take us through the two articles. We can maybe start with the first and have discussion unless you'd like to do both of them and then have a discussion afterwards.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 David Morgan - 1197</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll do the first one. Perfect. The inland wetland district. That sounds great. So the inland wetland district has come up in recent redevelopment projects as sort of a question mark. Yes, and I do apologize for anyone who is speaking this evening. The HVAC is a bit loud, so you do need to project over it a bit. We don't have microphones currently in the room that are projecting this evening. Thank you. So the inland wetland district has come up as a bit of a question mark recently in redevelopment projects. The district is on the books as what I understand as a pre-Wetlands Protection Act way of achieving the same goals through zoning. And since then, of course, we've had almost 50 plus years of the Conservation Commission and State Wetlands Protection Act on the books, our local bylaw, of course. It's been around many decades and a very robust document. The concern with the inland wetland district is that it's principally outmoded. The fact is the Conservation Commission supersedes on pretty much all fronts. So we've gone and checked with the Zoning Board of Appeals to see if it would be effective for them to continue having zoning oversight of the wetlands district. Their feeling is that it's duplicative. We don't really need to have the inland wetland district on the books. More to the point, it's erroneous, let's say. The data that are suggested that the town holds in the wetland district language is not actually represented in the zoning maps that we provide to the public, for example. So there's a lack of communication about what the definition of the district is in the first place. We're, at present, unable to communicate what this really means to the public. That's, of course, a pretty easy thing to fix. We can just update maps and so forth, but I think our time would be better spent with the expertise of the Commission being the go-to for all inland wetland concerns. And, of course, we have a robust permitting process established in town. The expertise of the Commission is held in very high regard. We have a very well-educated, very informed, very responsible Commission. And Inspectional Services, EBA, I agree from where I sit in planning that we're all on the same page. We would like to just take it off the books. I don't think it makes sense to have in the zoning any longer. We gain no additional benefit from the zoning enforcement. We already have mechanisms for that via CONCON. Hello, I'm Chuck Tironi. I'm the Vice Chair of the Arlington Conservation Commission. And only to say that the Conservation Commission voted at its last meeting on December 7 to support this unanimously. I have to agree with everything David said about the zoning district, and I think it's where I've worked in two other communities, but they also abolished the zoning district and left it up to the Conservation Commission. And so the Conservation Commission is very well capable of managing the Wetlands Protection Act and the Town Wetlands Protection Bylaw and regulations. So, this was supported by the Commission. Fantastic. Seems pretty straightforward. I'll see if any of the members of the board have any questions on this first of two proposed warrant articles, starting with Ken. I'm very supportive of what you guys said. I think it's time to shift over. I do have one general question to this, okay? And it has nothing to do with what we're speaking right now. Is it loosely related? Yes. Okay. There's a, I think it's called a no-name stream or river that runs through Arlington? Yes, no-name brook. No-name brook, okay. I'm not sure, is it ever wet? It's wet, yeah. It is? Maybe today. Maybe today, okay. But how is the Commission addressing that? Because I know a few years back, someone did an addition, and it had to be taken down because it was within the setbacks of the brook. And it wasn't clearly identified. I mean, I believe the owner did everything right, and it just somehow slipped through the cracks. I just want to say, can we do something about that so it doesn't happen in the future? Because it was a real shame. Yeah, so I don't know what year that happened, but we have been working on our maps throughout the town, our GIS system. And when you go to the wetlands GIS maps for the town of Arlington, it casts a jurisdictional marker around all the properties that the Conservation Commission has to review. And this has helped not only homeowners and residents of Arlington, but the building department also, which has increased their calls to the Conservation Commission to allow us to get a first look at some of these projects prior to them being built. So we've made some steps. I'm not sure when this happened, but that is very unfortunate. I would say, I'm an old timer here, so maybe Gene might know too. I don't. It was probably eight, maybe nine years ago. It was a pretty big, I feel real bad for the homeowner. Yeah, I'll have to look into that. I don't, it doesn't ring a bell. But it's the no-name brook, their backyard is right there. It did a family room addition. I just want to make sure that there's somehow clear enough information that this doesn't happen again. That's all I'm saying. Absolutely, yeah. It's mapped currently and we're doing a study of it with CPA dollars to see how we can enhance that. Okay, and there's a short list where they go through saying, hey, you have to follow within these criteria here. There's certain things you have to sort of follow. I'm not sure, but yes. And these are the people you've got to contact to make sure you're within, you know, it's a little small checklist is all I'm asking. Yeah, I think there's definitely a checklist and it certainly is reviewed. You know, as these places become known, it becomes more obvious to the building department, to all the departments to understand that, you know, they remember stories like you just told us. And so no-name brook would probably be looked at a lot more and remembered by not only all the neighbors. First stop is the building department. Everyone in town realizes for many years that they need a building department permit to do any kind of work. The same's not true with conservation permits. So that surprise is built in. And so we have to intercept that prior to what happened here, which was a foundation, a permitting process, a review. I mean, there was a lot of time spent there that the conservation commission wasn't aware of the project. And unfortunately, it probably wouldn't have been allowed if it was, you know, it has to be removed. So it's good to check all the boxes prior to, you know, for the town and for all the committees, you know, the same with the homeowner, just to make sure that they're heading in the right direction. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Shana. I think this is likely a great path to be going down. It does seem to make a lot of sense to me. Are there areas that the removal of the district would leave unprotected or less protected that ConCom does not have in its purview, but the district does? So the answer to that has to be yes and no. And I'm not trying to do a delicate dance here. But you are. But the fact of how it's defined currently is kind of no man's land. And if strictly interpreted, there may be places where this applies, but ConCom doesn't have jurisdiction. But it doesn't have a formal definition that works. And so I think any tweak that we would make to it in order to correct it, like if we were going to go that route instead, we would wind up aligning it with ConCom's jurisdiction. And it's similar to the floodplain district. Those are overlapping entirely. Okay. Thank you. Great clarification. Thank you for the question.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 557</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene. Yeah, I have two or three questions. One was related to Shana's question about whether there's not a perfect overlap between the two. So the current inland wetland district is for a horizontal distance of 200 feet from the centerline of any perennial river, brook, or stream. So I'm just wondering what the Conservation Commission jurisdiction is. Is it 200 feet or is it less? For a stream, it would be, so for a perennial stream, it would be 200 feet from the centerline. So it's the same. And for an intermittent stream, it would be 100 feet from the top of the bank. So this doesn't have intermittent streams in there. Well, it sounds like in that situation, the worst case scenario would be 200 feet. So if you had an inland wetland district on an intermittent stream, you're casting 100 more feet than you need to. So maybe this is... No, this is just perennial. It doesn't deal with intermittent streams at all. So my second question is, in the past few years, has there anything that hasn't gotten to the Conservation Commission, but the building inspector's gotten something and said, oh, wetland district, therefore I can't do something, and sends it to the Conservation Commission? Because this overlaps a lot with your jurisdiction, I agree. But I just wonder if there are times where, because the building inspector implements this, but he doesn't implement your regulations, if this is sometimes an entree into wetland regulations. I think that would be a great conversation start with David and the building inspector. So David, you may know of a few where that happened? No, I don't. I'm not aware of any circumstances where the building inspector got inland wetland district. Yeah, I'd be interested in having a conversation with Head of Inspectional Services to make sure that's the case, because I just think this is a really good idea. But I just want to make sure that we're not losing something important in the process. We need to say that conversation should happen all the time, even when there's just a perception that there may be, you know, no-name brook ends at some point. What is the next three houses, and maybe David and the building inspector wants to talk about those, just to make sure that they're not in the conservation's jurisdiction. It all starts with communication. So my other question is, in addition to the inland wetland district overlay in the zoning bylaw, we also have a floodplain district overlay. How come you're not coming to us asking us to get rid of that, too? The floodplain overlay district is required by law in order to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program and so on and so forth. There are many eligibility requirements that necessitate a floodplain district. I very likely will be coming back to you in the future to change the language of the floodplain district, because FEMA told us back in June or July of this year that they were going to update their flood maps, and with that process, when they finally get back around to individual municipality conversations, they suggest tweaks to the zoning language of the floodplain district in each municipality. So that's on the horizon. Okay, thanks. That's all my questions. Thank you, Gene. Steve?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a little bit of history, Arlington repodified its zoning bylaw in 2017 and 2018, and one of the points of discussions was how to handle these two overlay districts and the overlap with the Conservation Commission's jurisdiction. And what we tried to do at the time was to sort of separate wetland stuff from used stuff so that what was in the zoning bylaw dealt with land uses and everything else went to the Conservation Commission's jurisdiction. Rereading this section, there's not necessarily a whole lot of substance in terms of land use. So I agree that the Conservation Commission is, you know, you guys are a very bunch of bright, dedicated people who know what you're doing and you are completely capable of handling this stuff. So I'm generally supportive of removing it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you, Steve. And I am supportive as well. I did make the note to follow up with Mike Champa and the NISD about the question that Gene asked regarding whether there are any cases that the building department would have caught because of the overlay rather than the other vehicles that you've already provided to them when they know to call CONCOM for a review, just to make sure that we can all effectively answer that question when it comes in front of town meeting. Great. Any other questions before I ask them about the second proposed article?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Let's move on to the second article.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 David Morgan - 568</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there are a total of 68 districts, sorry, not districts, parcels in Arlington where we've identified open space as the principal use, yet they are zoned many different. They're in different districts. I mean, it doesn't matter. They're all across the board. But the thing that unites them, of course, is that they are open space parcels. So these range from the cemeteries, for example, to parks and playgrounds, recreation properties, conservation properties, etc. And following the open space recreation plan and the public land management plan that identified the owners and managers of all of these parcels, we would like to shift the zoning to reflect the use. And we'll have a later conversation about who owns and who doesn't. manages which pieces. This is sort of the first step in that direction. And as you will all be familiar, open space designation comes with pretty heavy use restrictions. So the way that I've gone about identifying these parcels is first to look at our open space and recreation plan inventory, compare that with the existing zoning map, and find the discrepancies, and then anything else that fits the definition of open space in this open space district section of the bylaw, specifically saying that structures are ancillary to the principal use, which is open space. I've added a few in that meet those criteria and have been identified by others as open space parcels. So I think that's really the long and short of it. I think cleaning up the zoning in this regard would benefit the town to know what it has, to be able to do the count effectively each time we need to account for all of our open space, to better, as I said earlier, assign responsibilities in light of open space zoning. It will improve efficiencies in terms of management and use and so forth. And I put together a list of the properties in question. There are 15 that are loosely themed around recreation. Those are mostly zoned R1 and R2. We also have 18 that are used for conservation purposes. R1, multi-use plan unit development, or R0 currently. I broke out a separate segment of cultural and historic uses. These are ones with historical significance, of course, or they might actually be there. There's one odd one in this category. That's the little park right next to the high school where it was, I forget the name of the condos that are right next to the high school there, but they put this in as open space and a constructed wetland back there. That is a cultural use. And in my designation, there are four properties that are privately held. Those are mostly affiliated with like Bed for Boat Club or the Winchester and Belmont Concert Clubs. There's also one conservation restriction owned by the Wharton family. These are all zoned R0 and R1. And I've already mentioned the cemeteries. There are four of those properties, totaling eight parcels. The Recreation, Park and Rec Committee has voted to support this rezoning. Likewise for Conservation and Open Space Committee all in support of this. The Cemetery Commission has questions about what it really means and how they'd like to proceed. So I would recommend further engagement with them if you all decide to take this up. But I think I'll stop there and see if there are any questions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you. My first question is, do you have a map currently of this? And is that something that maybe we could follow up with the board? Yeah. OK, great. And my second question is, is there a map that overlays the current open space plan to see? I'm assuming some of these are included in the open space plan and some of them are not? Right. OK. Those are the two questions that I have. I'll go to Ken.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kin Lau - 348</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two quick questions. I think I also agree with Mr. Sephardt. Except for your five districts, I have issues with only one of the districts. And that is the private one. Right now, the boating club, the yacht club, or the country club and all that stuff there, if they ever close or if they ever decide to change, it would become open space. It would be zoned as open space so nothing could happen to it besides what's there. And I think that is a shame. I really think golf clubs are the worst land use anything and everything that goes through here. Waste of money, waste of land, everything. And I would hate to turn that back to open space. We have a beautiful water edge that could always develop for other people. I would definitely not leave it as R0, R1, where you put mansions up there. I would definitely like to see if we can change that to a higher R value so there could be more people that can live there and share it if these things ever change. So that's the only thing I would take out of that. Say, let's look at this some more and see if we can do something in that four properties or nine parcels or whatever. Saying, let's use that open space. I guess you could call it open space. It's not really an open space. But it is because it's not shared by everybody. It's private open space. And I would like to make it such that where it could become public or be more for the town where it could be more housing there. And it could be a full range, not just rich mansions there where there's five or six of them plop along there because it's R0 and R1. If you increase it to R6 or something like that, then you have a density where you can increase and make it so that everybody can live there or at least an opportunity for people to live there. I'll leave it at that.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kin Lau and David Morgan - 191</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then does this include the open space that we have right now in, is it in Belmont? We have this, we lease this land from. The Great Meadows? Yes, Great Meadows. That's in Lexington. We can't zone Lexington. No, no, no. But that's open space. Do we count that as part of ours or theirs? Or is it nothing? I'm not sure what Lexington does and whether they're double counting, but we do count it as Arlington's. So we do count that we lease as open space for us. We own it. We don't lease it. So we own it, but we don't, do we count that as open space for, I don't know. OK, I've never seen it in anything saying, we have limited open space. I think it's in the open space plan that we reviewed. Is it? Most recently. And I missed it, OK. That's OK. We had a little bit of a discussion. That's the only reason I remember that one. OK. I mean, it's a great place to bike. OK. And walk. OK. I'm not there yet. That's all I had. OK. Thank you, Ken.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Shaina Korman-Houston - 1244</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shana. I think Ken makes an important distinction between the public and the private open space. And I would worry about the burden on individual property owners. I think there is a lot of value in clarifying the parcels, clarifying the zoning of the parcels. But I agree that leaving out privately held parcels might have value for slightly different reasons than Ken knows. Sure. Great. Gene. So right now, when I find it, our definition of open space district includes parcels under the jurisdiction of a number of things. It doesn't mention private owners, right? So if we were to do this, we would also need to change the definition of open space district to include private ownership. But it also says structures where present are clearly accessory to the principal open space and recreation function of the properties. And I think there are a number of properties here where the primary use is not the open space, but the primary use is the house, such as Case and Russell House, where the primary use is the house. It's not the land in front of it. The Medford Boat Club, where it's mostly building and places for the boat and not very much open space. I say that's the opposite of what is currently in the definition. I think a few months ago, at one of the meetings, I said, gee, I wonder why the cemeteries are zoned residential. And I don't know if that was one of the impetuses for this. But when I got this, I did some research about that. And what I found, not for Arlington, but in general, that most cemetery areas ended up being zoned residential. Because when places were growing, and they were like, where are we going to put things, they decided we don't want the cemeteries in industrial areas. We don't want the cemeteries in commercial areas. So they tended to zone them to be in residential areas. So then I looked at what is the current zoning of cemeteries. And I obviously couldn't look everywhere. But I just looked for some general information. And in many places, they're still zoned residential. In some places where they're not zoned residential, they're zoned specifically for cemetery with a definition of what cemetery is that includes burials and crematoria and things like that that we have. Our definition, and I found very few that were actually zoned as open space. So I think that, especially since the Cemetery Commission has some questions, I think it may be worth considering speaking with them and maybe looking at setting up a separate district called Cemetery for them and creating a definition of what a cemetery district would be. So I think we should think about that. The private properties, I guess I have a couple of things with the private property owners. We can certainly ask to rezone someone's property without their permission. But we should certainly ask them what they think about this and whether they'd be interested in going ahead or not. And sort of building on what Ken and Shana said, the problem legally with zoning somebody's property as open space is then you've taken away all economic value that they have for the property, and it amounts to a taking. And they could theoretically sue the town for taking the town and either need to rezone, or the town would have to pay for the economic value of the property that they've lost. So I have a little concern about the constitutional potential problem, let's say, in rezoning private property for open space for those reasons. And also, I know at least one it says has a conservation restriction, but those can be lifted. So they're not forever. So it's not as if there's a conservation restriction that goes with it. That's a reason to make them open space, perhaps, but it also would allow them at some point to say we'd like to make an economic use of the property. If you don't let us do that, look at all these wonderful US Supreme Court cases that say we can sue and get money. So I have some concern about the private properties, both because the boat club doesn't really meet the definition of open space. I couldn't find where that conservation restriction, I think the information said it was on Brantwood Road. And I looked up and down Brantwood Road, because I live nearby, and I couldn't. It's somewhere, but I didn't know where it was. And I couldn't find it. I looked at the assessor's database, couldn't find it there either. I don't know where it is. It would be sort of spot zoning that little place. Spot zoning's not necessarily illegal, but it does raise that concern also about in a residential neighborhood, just spot zoning a little place. So I like the idea of the recreation places in general. I like the idea of the current conservation places in general, but I think I would want to look at each one individually and see if they make sense. Historic, cultural, you know what some, this is the other thing I looked up. What some communities have done for those things is rather than zone them as open space, they zone them as public administrative space or governmental space or something like that. So they're not specifically seen as open space, which is more open spaces with not much on them, but something that, you know, which might be appropriate for Monument Park, Jason Russell House, things like that. So we might want to take a look if that's a better designation for some of them than open space. So maybe we need a cemetery zone for the cemeteries. Probably that would make sense at this point. We might need some sort of public realm zone for the historic cultural ones that are public. I'm not sure what to do with the private ones, but it would be worth having some conversation, I think, with them about that. And then maybe the others would fit into an open space zone, but I'd want to look at each one of them and see. That's where I am on that. I wanted to let you know that most conservation restrictions we try to do perpetuity, and there's a tax benefit. I know. You can point to one of those. So it might line up a little bit better in open space than the first look at it, but I did like the other points you made. I was unaware of the Medford Boat Club. It's mostly structure, so that's interesting. And golf, I don't know if you'd be fighting the other side, but the golf areas don't need to sell off some part of their land or housing. You know what I think was interesting about the golf area? I asked somebody, so what part of the ... I don't belong to the Winchester Country Club, by the way, but I did ask somebody sort of what part's in Arlington. Is this correct? They said it's the parking lot. So if it's the parking lot, if that's correct, does it make sense to have the parking lot ... It's more several holes in the parking lot. So we need to think about whether it makes sense to zone a parking lot as open space, and although maybe there are a few holes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gina, I believe it's more than half the club. Let's get the map, which is something we've requested, and then we can certainly review that. I think we're headed in a really good direction with this, but I think we need to look at the things that I've talked about. Great. All good thoughts. I want to go back to your first point. Sorry. Just before you enter, can I just remind everybody to please project for everybody who has joined us this evening? Thank you. Thank you. The definition that you mentioned at the outset where it says jurisdiction of park and rec or CONCOM is not factual. Conservation Commission's jurisdiction extends into myriad private properties. I mean, we're talking about ownership and management here, not jurisdiction, and so I think we want to clarify that in the definition. I was also anticipating this question about the cemeteries in that space of the definition to say maybe it's also up to the Cemetery Commission, but I hear your points about cemeteries. That history is very interesting, and obviously they need to chime in up there in two cents. Yeah. It doesn't say that every property in the jurisdiction of the Conservation Commission is open space. What it says is the reverse, which is some open space is in the jurisdiction of the Conservation Commission. I'll take your word for it. I mean, yeah, it's a little vague, but that's, I think, the better way to read it. Great. Thank you, Gene. Steve.</blockquote>

So I'll start by agreeing with Mr. Benson regarding the way we have the definition of open space district in our bylaw, you know, where structures are clearly an accessory, and I agree with him that a lot of the historic properties like the Jason Russell House, the structure is the main feature of the parcel. I was wondering, in the, I did look at the map linked in your memo, and are there cases where the proposed district is not, the proposed district boundaries are not coincident with parcel boundaries? Shouldn't be. I drew that from the parcel data. Okay. Does it look? Okay. There, I went back and forth. One of the features of our current map is that the district boundaries lie on, are basically defined in terms of parcel boundaries. So you have a parcel that's in one district, and there were some that, there were a number of them where what I saw on the RTIS map didn't line up with, didn't line up with them, for example, behind the high school. It looked like the playing field was sort of designated as an open space district, but that's only part of the parcel. The same thing with the multi-use district, you know, around Arlington 360, and I guess it's a senior living center, lower on the hill. I mean that that's one thing about our bylaw that I like but it's you know it's not a it's not a deal-breaker to me. But going back to schools, have you had any conversations with the school depart with either the school department or the school committee about this? Great question. I have not since the park and rec folks tend to manage those spaces anyway. I went directly to them. And again, this is coming out of a public management plan and trying to align those uses with the ownership and management of said parcels. So I did not go to the schools, but I think it's a good idea. So what one can the consideration or the concern I had in mind was periodically you know there a few years ago we had a big demographic shift in East Arlington. A bunch of older families moved out, younger families moved in, and the school district needed to add I think six classrooms to one school and four to another. But if you you know so having the like the playground, the outdoor area is not zoned as open space gives the school district more flexibility where you know in order to deal with that sort of thing. So I would like to them to weigh in specifically on that. I just interrupt, the Hardy school is a really good example of that where they refigured the area, they moved things around. Yeah. So regarding the planned unit development district. I, you, I'm personally for speaking for myself I would not want to do anything with that while Thorndike Place is still in the process of going through permitting. And until I know there is no there's an agreement to be reached regarding the disposition of the non developed portion. Until that does settles, I, I, I'm kind of leery on making any changes to that district. And I think that's all. Yeah. And finally, I also had the same concern as Mr Benson where if rezoning private land would basically be considered a taking. And, you know, where the owner would be entitled to compensation from us. Thank you.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just have one thing to add and then I'll come back to you. So, um, once you know, Gene provides his comment I can kind of recap and then we'll see if there's any other conversation but I just wanted for the board, us to be thoughtful of this and in reviewing this as well. Given that we are currently undoing some zoning that was whatever is currently on the parcel becomes the zone. You know, that's what happened in the 70s and we are actively undoing that work right now so that's one of the reasons why I asked for the overlay of the open space plan with with these spaces because I think if the town has planned for better and higher uses of some of these places, some of which are not currently zoned as open space that that makes to me perfect sense to, to move those into this plan but for those that happen to be open space, and, but perhaps have not been contemplated as planned open space use within the town. I would ask more questions about the, the why now and should that be part of the plan, not to say that those couldn't potentially be added in the future just like we look at what the appropriate size and scale of zones are not regularly but you know not infrequently within within the town as well so that's the only thing I wanted to mention to the board given again the work that we're currently engaged with. The one thing I forgot to mention. I wonder if you've talked to the assessor's office about whether this rezoning would change any assessments on any of the land that's not currently owned owned by the town. You know, for example, I don't know have any idea how we tax the part of Winchester Country Club. That's in Arlington, but, and I don't know the answer that's why I'm interested in the assessor. I don't think we're going to the Medford boat club with this, but for all of the things that are not government or private nonprofit, but things that are taxed. What's the taxing application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great question. Sorry I forgot that. No, I had that one written down and I forgot to ask it as well so. Please. It's kind of anecdotal but it's funny we've talked about Medford boat club. Numerous times. Yes, conversation. The piece of it that is actually proposed in the map here is that section of the dam that is just east of Medford. Yes, conversation. The piece of it that is actually proposed in the map here is that section of the dam that is just east of the actual club. And so that essentially does function as open space I mean it's, it's built, but it is, you know, it's that nice mural with the fish and so forth on the ground. It's a place that people go for scenic vistas, you know, it's not like you're actually getting in a boat right there so. I've been there many times. Does it include the park a lot that's just outside of it. No, it's just that paved area parking lot to the start of the actual dam or sort of that. Okay. Open space. I can't describe it another term. No, no, I know exactly what you're talking about.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. My name is Barry Jasper and I live on Campbell Road. Regarding the inland district, you're describing described how I think you said that it was kind of vague maybe contradictory in places. It would be useful when you were discussing like, in what way would removing that enlarge or reduce or change in some way. The total protection of wetlands relative to what the CONCOM has. And you said sort of yes and no, there would be some because like it's vague, right. So it would be, it would be really useful to say, maybe take the zoning district, the most expansive interpretation of what the zoning district could be. And then say, OK, if we take it away and CONCOM ends up with what it already has. Here are the things that will change. The protections for what that would give a really clear view of that list would be big, it would be small, it would be whatever it is, and then we can evaluate it. Whereas, as a member of the public, I have no idea. Great. Thank you very much. Anyone else wishing to speak.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant Cook, 16 Wollaston. And I'll echo I think something you already brought up in this topic about rezoning to open spaces. If we read in the paper a week from now that the Winchester Country Club was disposing of its land to move to another peat die course to be built up in Carlisle. And 40 acres fell into the town's lap. To say that it would only be for new Sherwood Forest, I think, would be foolhardy. Almost as foolhardy as turning it into a mansion. So I would say no. That would be a probably even more dramatic than the Sims discussion over 40 acres coming. And I agree it should be perhaps housing, parks, commercial. We talk about commercial needing space here in town. And I think you look at the debate on the Cape over twin brook golf courses. Golf courses do go away. And if you lock this in as open space in the town's mind, rolling it back to allow some housing or anything else, I think, would be a decision we've come to regret. I think let's I would say let's save that property for the big discussion that we'll have if it ever comes free, which it probably won't. But we should plan for the future. So thanks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Any other comments? Okay. This time we'll close public comment on this agenda item. So just to discuss with the board, one of the or I guess I should ask you the question, is your request that the board take on either or both of these articles or is your request for support? Everybody comes in with a different request. So just looking to see what your request is here. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. So I would like to turn it back to the board. It sounds like there was pretty significant support with just one significant question for the inland wetland district. For the open space, it sounds like there are quite a lot of questions and unknowns and potential mapping, map review that would need to occur. So I'm interested in hearing the board's feelings on taking on either or both of these articles. And I'll start with Ken. Would this be for the spring or for the fall?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no fall, just spring. Spring, this year. This year. I'm not sure we have time to do that. Which one? Number two? Open space? Both. I don't think we have time this year to do either one. Okay. Because if we're going to take on this and not take on commercial, the business districts and the heights and stuff that we did, we have also had problems with people that we look at right away saying it's too busy, we don't have enough time to do that. And then we take on this. It's not a good thing. Okay. I just would set priorities. And if you want us to take it on this spring, I don't think we have the bandwidth to do that. I would say if you could do it, we would support you. But otherwise, you would have to wait until either fall or next year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. Thank you. So my perspective is that I think that we should take on the inland wetland district. I think that this is well baked. There's just one clarification. I think the open space still needs a lot of work. And I think we would need to discuss whether or not to Ken's point, we think there is the time to review that. It could be a mapping exercise and a simple de-scoping of what is currently included in this article. But I think we would need to discuss that further.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shana? I'm in agreement with the chairwoman. Gene? Yeah, I agree. I think we can take on inland wetland. You know, I've watched this conservation commission for many years. And I've watched them adopt better and better regulations. And I think they are excellent at protecting the wetland resources in town. And they've been that way for many, many years. I am interested to see whether there are some areas that don't quite overlap. And whether those even matter. Or they're just a function of this really old zoning bylaw not doing it right. But I think we can get that. And I think we can go ahead with that. I think it seems like the appropriate thing to do. And a way to get rid of yet another creaky out of date mismatch between various parts of the regulatory places in the town. On the open space piece, I don't think we're going to be ready to go. I think there were too many questions that were asked that needed to get answered. And too many sort of decisions, trees to go down. To doing all of these things. I think it's a worthwhile project to pursue. And maybe we can designate somebody from the board to work with David and the conservation commission. And the open space commission on putting together something that would come to us 11 months from now, let's say. So that we would be able to roll into it at that point. And maybe there will be something separate for cemeteries or not. Something separate for some of the public spaces. The questions about the assessments, et cetera. The assessments and things like that. So I don't think it's ready to go. I think we can make it ready to go. But it needs some time.</blockquote>

You're going to make me say that five times until I'm eating too, right? Well, I guess I know what I'm presenting. I agree that I think the goals of looking at revisiting some of the way some of our parcels are zoned, cemeteries, et cetera, et cetera, is worthwhile. But there's a lot to figure out in order to get that done.</blockquote>

And we have not one, not two, not three, but six. Six proposed warrant articles, all very worthwhile for discussion in terms of, you know, what I understand to be sections of the zoning bylaw which are particularly meaningful to the ZBA, and it looks like as well from the conservation commission with related to things that you run into regularly in your practice. So Christian, if you wanted to take it away, would you like to review them as a group, or would you like to go one by one and entertain questions? I'm happy to go one at a time. Let's do that. I think that would probably be best. Great. Perfect. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Christina Klein - 517</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you again for having me. I'm Christian Klein, the chair of the Zoning Board of Appeals. And, you know, we deal with sections of the code that the ARB often doesn't see on a regular basis in their hearings. And so there's a couple things that we've identified throughout the past year or two that have caused us some questions, have caused us to go to council to try to get some clarification on. And so there are things that we wanted to bring to your attention for possible inclusion as warrant articles going forward. So the first one has to do with the question of attached and detached buildings. So in the bylaws we have a separate definition for attached and detached. And buildings that are attached share a common wall, and buildings that are detached have no physical connection. But there are other forms of physical connection that are not walls that cause two structures to be neither attached nor detached. And this has come up once, and there was another case that was possibly coming forward, but in the end they didn't file. And so it had initially come up in the question of accessory dwelling units because it has a question of if a dwelling unit isn't attached to the main building, then it is approved as a part of the main building. If it's an accessory dwelling unit and it's within a certain distance of the lot line, then it requires approval by the ZBA. And so there was a situation where there were two buildings, they were very close to each other, but there was a slight separation. And the question was, you know, is it attached, is it detached? How close do they have to be to be separated? And in the end we sort of had to, we found that they were, we declared them to be just not attached. And because the particular part that they were looking at said attached and it wasn't attached, we could move forward. But there are situations in the parking bylaws that says attached or detached garage. So if you have a garage that's separated from the house by a breezeway, it is neither attached nor detached. So there are situations like that. So either we need to clarify one definition or the other so that it covers everything, or we just need to think about how we want to handle those kinds of situations so that it's clear. And the other part to that is Section 533 on the spacing of residential and other buildings on one lot. It references the distance between a permitted main building to be used as a dwelling and a permanent non-residential building Which also sort of gets into this question of accessory dwelling units is are we supposed to be considering that? You know, it's a separate. How do we how do we look at those in relation to 5-5-5-5-3? Excuse me, 5-3-3 So that was the first one is really the sort of question to attach versus detach in the hole in between.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 707</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So yeah, I was trying to visualize the gap in the picture I came up with was just sort of a walkway or a ramp from one to the other I do agree that if we're going to define detached It should be exactly the opposite of attached and I my personal thought would be to Redefine detached so that it was the negation of attached just to make it very clear and simple, but If that if you think that would be a pseudo if that would address the the issues that the CDA is running I think it could we'd also taken a look through where in the bylaws we use the word attached and where we use the word detached We use detached a lot more Than we do attached So We use So there's a lot of places where there's exemption there's certain street exemptions in 542 where we certain sections of town are excluded from certain parts of the Residential restrictions and their references attached accessory buildings Or attached dwellings attached dwellings Also in their accessory dwelling units references attached dwellings And then locations of parking spaces talks about attached and detached garages and then under detached We talk about there's a lot that talks about detached dwellings the residential design table the residential District tables are all written in terms of detached So it occurs there a great amount Garages again the floodplain district talks about detached dwellings Parking spaces talks about detached garages and affordable housing requirements talk about detached dwellings So, I don't know if that feeds into which definition makes more sense, but that's sort of how those words are used Anything else to you nothing else. Okay, Jean I'm trying to consider the examples you talked about. Are they mostly where there's like a Carport and sort of an enclosed or not enclosed walkway So what we've had sort of like an elevated deck that would connect an accessory a proposed accessory dwelling unit from a main building And the deck makes it attached. So the deck it maintains it is detached the Proponent strongly wanted it to be considered attached because it didn't meet the definition for detached But you know, we're like well, it doesn't meet the definition for attached anyway either So you sort of then you're in that in that braza In the end, we did decide that it was just not attached because attached was the primary word in that section And tell me say again how it comes up in the Situation of accessory dwelling units. So under accessory dwelling units if an accessory dwelling unit is attached to the primary Residence then it is either approved or not approved as a part of the structure if it is Detached from if it's not attached and it's in a separate accessory building as long as it conforms to the setback requirements Then it would go through the normal process But if it's within this if it's within six feet of a lot line, then it's required to go before zoning But if it's attached and within six feet It wouldn't But then what's the level of attachment that is required to move it from one category to the other? Is there a simple fix or is it more these are? factors to consider in Determining whether something is attached. I think it could be There's I think there's two ways of looking at it One way is there are currently there are sort of these it sort of falls into three buckets at the moment they are either one or the other or a sort of neither right and I think that we could clarify in one of the definitions just add a line that if it is, you know, if we were to say with attached if it's you know a Structure that does not Contain a wall in common and shall we you know shall be detached? Or shall be considered detached just so that we put into one category or the other and I think we could that would be The simple way to do it and then the definition but detached stands on its own as well</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 430</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, thanks, that's it So you mentioned You mentioned carports as as a situation I I also am trying to grapple with With what the solution is what the desired solution is and I'm sort of wondering where you've been coming down on things that are Essentially not a part of that. So luckily we have not had the the the semi-attached garage come up But that was when we were sort of brainstorming like what the issues possibly could be It's the OSU sort of have the traditional house where you have a house and a garage and they build a breezeway in between that's open that is Detached it's not detached because of the roof piece connecting it but it's not attached because it doesn't share a wall And then for there if you strictly read the zoning bylaw you could claim that it can't be used for parking So So can Can you? Contemplate is there a scenario that you can contemplate where something truly? Truly does not have a party wall, but kind of looks like it should fit the attached scenario I Mean I think sort of in that scenario we are we would Not speaking of the ZBA, but I think you're sort of looking at a typical New England style house where it's the house and the breezeway in the garage I think most people would consider that as being attached even though it's not enclosed in between But I think we just sort of need to decide how we you know as a town how we want to handle that the situation should be So it might be more than One common wall. Yeah, there might be some other Aesthetic and aesthetic from the street, for example, it appears to be One structure. We need something that we can defend. Yeah If I can pick up on that, I I think The answer is not one or the other I think the answer is What's the better outcome and then how do we write the definition for the better outcome, right? If it's the Detached garage with a carport. Is it better that that garage be considered? Attached to the building in terms of how we do our business in town or not. So before I think we decide Which way to write this we need to hear from the ZBA What's the better option? What's the better outcome? Okay, not give us one or the other Yeah, but which is the better outcome with the ADUs? Which is the better outcome?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 610</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay, and then that would help us decide how to write this so a list of the potential scenarios and I think Gene hit it right on the head. Yeah, it's it's the outcome What we want to do then we write the regulations to that but but you are correct it's basically it's three attached Not attached and something in between. Yeah. All we want to do is clarify that thing in between And that's all we have to do and we have to do it. It's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's We want to do is we'll clarify that based on what outcome we want. I Mean, I remember this being a project. We looked at at the Sunnyside Sunnyside Drive where they were gonna put these These big mansions there and they had this one heated quarter that connected this other garage Yeah, and it was and it was all one big happy building and we said no okay, and I don't we I don't think you want to get that way. So that's how they said that we decide, you know, it's that Breezeway that's connects the building. Yeah. Okay. Is it just a deck in a roof? Jack roof and wall. So it's enclosed or We go even one more step say it's conditioned, right? So but let's not decide all those notable games till we figure out What's the outcome we want Do you want to increase the sort of density at the edge because there's a loophole they can Go for or not so Can you come back to us and say hey? Our recommendation is this because it does this and I think We're all on board for that. So something like that. At least I am so I think In order to submit the warrant article that language We can continue to work and wordsmith. I think the warrant article could be written in such a way that We can speak to the clarification, okay without actually providing the the warrant article would others agree to that See if the town will amend the zoning bylaw of the town of Arlington for the purpose of clarifying The definition of attached detached and detached and addressing cases that meet neither of the above. Yeah, something like that. Yeah Yeah, I just wanted to talk through timing for that as well. Okay Okay, so it sounds like the board is supportive of this clarification and we'll get back to you with some okay great The second one is section 5 3 10 which allows using the average setback along a street It's a front yard setback, but it only applies to vacant property and so the question is should Where we don't have a lot of vacant property we do have Situations where we have a street where the setback is this for the street is not what the actual setback says in the zoning Bylaw, but it's sort of set by the houses that are there currently Should there If the property is vacant, then somebody is allowed to take that position if the property is not vacant then they're required to adhere to the full setback The way it's written and the question is just the clarification. Is that really what we're intending in that situation? Or is it better to maintain the street edge as it stands currently? As it stands currently, so if somebody's house is a little bit farther back and they want to do a small addition on the front of their house That would bring them to that average setback</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kin Lau and Others - 150</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah, but I think that's nothing to do with vacant or non-vacant. I think it has to do with if someone wants to encroach upon the setback and the average of the setback on that street Yeah, is less than they can meet that average, right? I think that's what they've been allowing And I believe that that is likely the case But that's not what the by-law says. I realize that But we should make that clear so that it's either we enforce it with the by-law says or change the by-law to follow what they enforce because it's I'm just seeing this and seeing what they've been doing all along is different So if you just talk to him about that and see how we should proceed Or what their recommendations are too. Okay, Shana What's your interpretation on redevelopment of parcels that are currently not vacant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so If you were to if there was an existing building on the property and the property was being demolished and the property being wholly redeveloped then Very good question because the At the time the building is demolished the property is now vacant, but it wasn't vacant at the time so you can't take it you can't I guess you could I would say if you are fully demolishing and rebuilding then you would Because you're required to adhere to all the requirements of the zoning by-law Then you would be able to take advantage of that provision and build up to that line. However, if you were maintaining two walls of your property in order to Claim that it is not a new development, but you are doing an addition then that puts you into You know, you are you are only allowed you are able to take advantage of certain others aspects specifically for The sections of by-law that deal with non-conformity that would allow you to do essentially the same thing Well It seems to that seems to honestly be not that not that useful I There are quite a few sections of the by-law I find very mysterious This is one of them Quote you on that And You know As as as I think you're pointing out It doesn't make any sense that if somebody is building a house on a vacant lot They get to use a different setback than somebody who already has a house on on the lot and wants to do something That that seems crazy. I would basically I This is another one, what do we want the outcome to be right, right, right exactly this is I Guess my personal feeling of this has always been that didn't this didn't make any sense at all and I would just X out five point three point ten all together because if Town meeting and its wisdom had established a certain setback Why are we then letting people sort of change the setbacks based upon what our people did before there was zoning or when it was changed, so You know, we can do anything we want in terms of thinking about what do we want to present the town meeting? I'd say one thing to think about is does this even make any sense at all to try to figure out? Which is the better way to do it should be allowed one way or the other which we just get rid of this. I I don't know the answer, but I'm putting it out there Great question Steve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean this is one of those sections where the bylaw is not quite internally consistent with itself Yes where You know the five three ten says sure if the whole street is non-conforming or if a portion of the street is not conforming Sure, you can build with the non-conformity We have another section of the bylaw that says it is an intent of this bylaw that Non-conformities where applicable or where practical should not continue in perpetuity So you've got one side that says yeah, let's continue it and one side that says it doesn't. And make it worse. This makes it worse Yeah, and I Do agree that it does, you know sort of create two Different scenarios depending on whether a parcel is conforming or non-conforming I sort of question, you know whether someone would demo an entire building assuming a buildable lot just to take advantage of the provision rather than you know, Do try to remodel and reuse? This is another section of our bylaw that I think may help encourage demolition rather than reuse I It does seem wrong to it does seem awkward. I'll say awkward You know to impose To have one set of standards for You know where a full demolition is taking place and another set of standards where a full Demolition is not taking place and to be you know, sort of to compound Compound things. There's there are lots of unbuildable lots in Arlington by today's standards where You know, you couldn't take advantage of that you couldn't use this provision even if you wanted to so I think Do you agree with Gene? We should just Take it out After checking with Mike Champin That he uses it for that would be important for us to keep it in yeah I reserve I mean part of the things that let's check with inspectional services and You know perhaps consider clarifying Their interpretation similar to what we did with large additions, right? Just so that there's not a not a question mark. It's clear. Yeah You know, otherwise I you know, I don't I'm not without expressing an opinion on what side or the one way or the other I think it would be more logical to Apply one set of standards regarding whether it was a full or a partial redevelopment And how often is this used? That's the other question to ask Mike Not yeah, if it doesn't happen very often. It's another reason to get rid of it Are we How do we feel or how do folks feel about About the front yard setbacks As opposed to the written front yard setbacks as opposed to the front yard setbacks that that See visually you know, are we going to start seeing houses infill that is set much further back? Is that going to have, is the aesthetic going to be changing? And how do we feel about that? By not having this provision. By not having this provision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great question. And that might be where, again, Mike Ciampa, you're indicating that your understanding is that might be how they're currently applying this. Yeah, but there's also exceptions to existing non-conforming sites that they can use that rule or something along those lines. It's just, I don't know the whole thing, so I can't speak clearly. I just know it's fuzzy right now. Right. And I totally agree, we should get rid of it and have one set of rules. But, you know, we do, you are 100% correct, we do run on the fact that if we do follow the rules of, well, here's the setback, you have to follow it. And that just ruins an urban edge on an infill, and that doesn't make sense. And that's why we have these exceptions. So, but we still got to see what applies, what doesn't apply right now. It seems to be in two different spots right now. And you pick out a good one, but there's another one that you haven't mentioned yet, and I think that's what Mike follows. Yeah. Is that correct? I'm happy to sit down with him and figure that out. All right, so it sounds like that's the path forward there. All right, next.</blockquote>

It gets to a certain point, and then it switches from letters and numbers to bullets. And it's just, it's just awkward to cite things. So we have citations like section 5-9-2, B1, bullet 5, subsection 3, which is just, you have to now count the bullets and make sure you're getting to the right one. So if we could exchange the bullets for some other unique identifier, that would be great.</blockquote>

No, but there are other, there are other places. There are lots of bullets in there. A lot of places. So 6-10, 6-1-10, and 6-1-11, I think they need a task force at this point. There are, these are the sections on residential parking that have been added onto and amended and added onto and amended, and in the end, they're sort of convoluted and difficult to follow and hard to interpret in places. I don't think it's an easy fix. I think it would take some sitting down and really thinking through exactly what we want as a town. So it may not be something for this year, but it's certainly something to think about. We should start. That we should start thinking, looking forward.

So as, having served on the ZVA, I can verify that there have been at least a couple of dockets where the meaning of those sections was not clear at all, and even less clear was how to apply them to a given parcel. It's, there is a little bit of circular wording, and I think in terms of just residential parking in general, I think clear, having something that's clear and readily understandable would be a big improvement. I also think it's worth, you know, possibly revisiting residential parking, some aspects of residential parking regulations in general.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then the last one I had is in regards to the location of accessory dwelling units in accessory buildings. So the way that the bylaw was written, 592, an accessory dwelling unit that is within six feet of the side and rear lot line could be approved by essentially a section six determination by the zoning board of appeals. But accessory buildings cannot be built within six feet of the property line. And so we had sort of considered a couple different options. And what we feel was most likely what was intended was that new accessory dwelling units could be constructed closer than six feet to the lot line so long as they had approval. And that was to be considered an exception from the standard setback that's in the dimension table. But the dimensions table doesn't list section 592 as containing an exception. It doesn't mention that to see section 542B for exceptions. And it may just be as simple if the interpretation is that accessory dwelling units can be constructed de novo within six feet of the property line, that the note that's on the table just indicates that see section 542B and 592B for exceptions. But if the interpretation was that accessory dwelling units were not to be constructed newly within six feet of the property line, we need that to be clarified.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 177</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Steve. So I have a vague recollection that the special permit within six feet was to accommodate the conversion of an existing garage to an accessory dwelling unit. Now garages, although there are setbacks in 542, there are a separate set of garage setbacks in 542B7 outside of the main dimensional tables. And I was sort of wondering if it would be appropriate to cite that or perhaps, and this would be messy, to move the sort of garage setbacks which vary on type of construction into the main dimensional tables. I think that the garage exceptions, the garage exceptions for new garages I think are fine as they are. The real question comes in, is the interpretation that this section in 592 on accessory dwelling units, is it intended only to apply to cases where there is an existing garage that's being converted? Or is it more general that you can build an accessory structure that is an accessory dwelling unit as an exception to the normal six foot setback that's required under the table?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 165</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. All right, thank you. Gene. How have you been interpreting it? So we had our first real case where this came up recently and it was on Dorothy Road and it was a property that was owned by HCA and they were looking to build an accessory dwelling unit in the rear yard. And we had gone back and forth, we had talked to council and the interpretation that the board took was that you could construct a new accessory dwelling unit within six feet of the line as long as you met the requirements for a determination that it was not more detrimental. That's exactly the way I interpret this too. So my suggestion may not be a good one. So my suggestion is leave this, you have the right to do rules and regulations, put something in the ZBA rules and regulations that basically says what you just said. This is how this is interpreted. And that's all that needs to happen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken. I don't know. I think a little differently. I think the intent of the ADUs was, in this case here, was for an existing. It doesn't say that. I realize that, Jean. And I think that was missed or something along that. But I think it was the intent to convert an existing structure to allow it to be built closer. If it's new, it has to follow the regulations. There's no exception for that. I think that was the intent. Because the first time I went around, that was what it was. And then the second time I came back for the ADUs, it was changed because that was a point that was brought up. And we changed that so that it would say for existing structures for it to be able to convert it, not new structures. But that was my regulation at that time, working with Barbara at that time. So can I add on to that? Because I actually found the fact sheet that Barbara created when we were presenting this article at the town meeting. And it talks about ADUs in garages and the fact that they're the most complicated because you need to have water and solar and gas, electric, et cetera. But they're specific to Article 43 as an extra requirement for a garage or carriage house, meaning these existing conversions, that is close to the lot line. If a garage is within six feet of the lot line, it is no longer eligible for an as-of-right ADU approval. The homeowner who wishes to proceed must present their case to the Zoning Board of Appeals. ZVA provides a public discretionary approval process, which all the neighbors are notified and have the ability to object. So it is not in this. And again, just because this was the fact sheet doesn't mean that this is what was approved or made it into the final language. But that was my recollection as well, was that that specific provision was for how it's written right here.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, what is it that we would like to see in practice becomes the question. But my recollection is similar to Kim's. Well, just to throw, just to make it more complicated. Absolutely. You know, if a person wanted to build a new garage, type through construction, concrete, they can put it right up against the lot line. They build the garage, they leave it there for a little while, now they want to turn it into an ADU. That would be, you know, it's a roundabout path, but I could connect the dots. And, you know, knowing that the dots could be connected like that, I sort of agree with Mr. Benson in the sense of just, you know, don't make it crazy. And it sounds like from the Dorothy Roadway, it's a better outcome to do that. And just to sort of put it in the rules and regulations, so it's clear that that's how it's being interpreted. But again, I would just check with Mike Champa and make sure it's the same interpretation. I would just say my only concern with just having that interpretation in the rules and regulations is that people aren't going to look there for interpretations. They're just going to be looking to the zoning by-law. Well, you can train them. Or we could add a sentence that says this applies to new as well as existing structures. Yeah. We could put that sentence in there, right? Or if we just refer to this section as an exception to the table, then that would work as well. Ken, what are your thoughts on that? I don't know. I can go either way. I think it's going back to the original. What's the outcome we want? Right. And then whatever we modify, what's that? That's all. And we're here to, I'm assuming here is to streamline the stuff and you have less confusion and so forth. So what do we want? Right. And if we don't want ADUs built so close to the property line, then get rid of it. If we want to leave it for some hardship cases because there's already an existing building there, then we keep it in. But I think the question isn't removing this. It's retaining the right for existing structures to come in front of the ZBA and adding, potentially adding, again, based on the interpretation, new structures being constructed to also fall under this. Yeah. I would add it to there. In the zoning bylaws as opposed to the rules and regs. Yes, not the rules and regs. So what's the answer to this question? They come before you and they say, we're building a garage on the lot up to the lot line with an ADU on top. So they're building it all at one time. What's the answer? So if a portion of the accessory structure contains an accessory dwelling unit within six feet, then the board has to make a determination. If it doesn't include an accessory dwelling unit and it's a garage, then it falls under the garage rule. So if it's an accessory dwelling unit and it's an accessory structure and it's neither a garage nor a dwelling unit, then you're not allowed to build it. So it's a little hall of mirrors. It could be a storage shed. It could be a storage shed. Yes. As long as it's under 70 square feet. Yes. We should fix this. I'm not sure quite how. OK. So I think this falls into the same section as, or the same as 5.3.10 in that we would need to, it sounds like work together with the ZBA after, again, talking to my Jampa a little further, and work through the final language. But perhaps the Warren article could identify to clarify the intent, and then the language can be worked on up until the hearing. I think we have two or three. Christian needs to talk to Mike. Absolutely. When this came up a couple years ago, I volunteered to be the ARB person to sit on that and craft the change. That would be great. I'd be happy to do that if that would work with you. Absolutely.</blockquote>

So let's just clarify which we'll be moving forward with. So we identified the attached building and detached building. And again, this is making sure that we're aligned on these being ARB articles that we're putting forth in collaboration with the ZBA. So the first was attached building and detached building. The second was changing the bullets to letters. Changing the average setback along the street related to vacant land. The exception related to vacant property. We've already talked about the inland wetland and floodplain district so that we will not for this particular item move forward, but we're moving forward separately. CONCOM, let's see, we indicated that we would defer to 2025 section 6.1.10a and 6.1.11a. And we will move forward the last item with regard to the clarification regarding ADUs and accessory buildings within six feet of the, within the six foot setback. Are we in alignment? Yep. Okay, great. Any members of the public who have any comments they would like to make on any of the Zoning By-law? articles put forth by the ZBA.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Susan Stamps - 1046</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much. My name is Susan Stamps. And I'm sorry I'm just going to remind you one more time if you wouldn't mind projecting as much as you can for the folks that are that are behind as well. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. My name is Susan Stamps. I am with the group Green Street Arlington and also a member of the tree committee and a town meeting member 39 Grafton Street and with me is Alan Jones. Alan Jones, precinct 14, member of Green Street Arlington. Great. Thank you. So we did, up on the screen is the proposal. The background of the proposal, this was one of the part of our six point plan that we presented at the time that we were discussing MBTA communities zoning and we agreed with the planning department that this was a change that needed to be made to the underlying zoning. So that's why we're back here now with this proposal and hoping that the ARB will support it and help us write it because it's pretty detailed. The idea is to require shading in parking lots and this is something that I think was not thought about when the parking lot regulations in the zoning bylaw were written because I don't think the writers were particularly concerned about the heat island effect of pavement absorbing the sun and making everything around it hot and in fact making the whole town hotter than it needs to be. But now with climate change and everything and the weather getting hotter and hotter every year, just in the last couple of years, the hottest ones on the planet, we need to be, Green Street Arlington hopes to help the town adopt initiatives which can hurry up and help protect the town from heat and also other effects of climate change such as storm water mitigation. What just happened today, we had these really, really heavy rains that we didn't used to have these rains and now they're fairly common. And so the storm water and heat are the main reasons why we are proposing that we put in new rules for our parking lots requiring trees to be planted in the parking lots and also both for shade and storm water mitigation and we've been asked about solar panels, can those be used for shade and the answer is yes, that's fine with us as long as there are trees around the perimeter so that there would be some trees. But there are two things that trees do, well trees do a lot of things, they clean the air, they respirate oxygen and moisture and certainly they absorb carbon so those are very important climate change jobs that they do but also their roots, of course, absorb storm water so that's also really important. The only thing that they also do that is shared with solar panels is they create shade. So that would have to be a call really by the planning department whether you want to give up all the benefits of trees for solar panels if it seems like we really need to be doing a lot more with solar panels to help get off of fossil fuels. So that's kind of a question that's up in the air but we have presented a two pager which summarizes a proposed bylaw change that is based on, tells you what the elements are based on one that we found in Greenberg, New York which is a smaller place than Arlington but they, and it actually hasn't been adopted in Greenberg but that was for unrelated reasons but they still are following it. We've looked around the state and there are a few municipalities around the state that require trees in parking lots say every 12 spaces or 10 spaces but they're not really focused on shade, they could be ornamental trees. I'm not exactly sure why they're required in the parking lots. For example, West Springfield requires trees in parking lots but we have found other places around the country, a few other places that talk about trees in parking lots in terms of percentage of shade that they provide and that's what we think is, that's the important approach and so we're suggesting 50% shade cover within 15 years of planting. So what we've found around the country is, LA actually has a 50% tree canopy in 10 years, 50% shade of tree canopy in 10 years in their parking lots. Also Sacramento has a similar ordinance which after 15 years, 50% canopy coverage in their parking lots. We also found one other place and I'm sure there are places we missed, it's not that common yet though and so once again Arlington can be an environmental leader and that's what we're looking for. In South Elgin, Illinois, they have a population of about half of ours with considerably more land but theirs is 40% tree canopy coverage in 10 years. We would like to see this apply to any parking lot. Gene Benson and David Morgan were both very kind to go over our proposal and there were questions about, well, what's the minimum size parking lot, would it apply? A couple of these places exclude single family and two family homes. One place, I think it's Sacramento, says it applies to any place that has a parking lot. You don't have a parking lot when you have a two family home or even a three family home probably. So those would be details to be worked out. I'd like to add that when we were doing our research and trying to figure out where in the zoning pilot on this would fit, sort of searching stuff, we actually found it. Great. 6.1.11 F2 bullet 1 or bullet 2 subsection bullet 1 or whatever. It says we already do this in an industrial zone with pervious pavement as an alternative. It says 50% shading or photovoltaic. So one simplistic way of looking at it is just make applicability broader than just that one condition. The specification there may not be enough detail. It's just like one sentence that says that. At least there is precedent in the zoning bylaw to do this.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 196</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So one, and this is primarily for the board, one of the allowed uses, one of the uses regulated by our zoning bylaw is a ground-mounted solar photovoltaic installation. It's also a defined term. But we only allow this in the industrial districts. And as part of considering this, maybe we want to broaden the set of districts where that use is allowed. In terms of how large of a parking lot, one precedent is the places where our zoning bylaw does apply a greater degree of regulations to a parking lot, it starts at six spaces. So there's basically one set of rules for five and fewer and one set at six or more. There's precedent there. This too can be revisited. I guess I was wondering, I have two basic questions. So the first is why 50%? And number two, just hypothetically, say as a board member, I'm given a planting plan. How do I evaluate whether or not that meets 50%? And that question was inspired by the sample drawing. But if you could, you wouldn't mind answering. So why 50% and then how, given this plan, how do I derive those numbers?</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Susan Stamps - 71</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think that, I mean, I would be very happy if it required 100% coverage. It just seems like that would be, maybe there wouldn't really be room for many cars in the parking lot. And then you're questioning, wondering why you even do it in the parking lot. So we just followed the example of these other places that have these requirements in place, which appear to be working.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 172</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Yeah. And I think, as Susan said, 50% just seems to be the common language around the country. And it's what's in our bylaw, for that particular example. And to be honest, this discussion all started in relation to the MBTA Communities Act. How many new parking lots are going to be built in Arlington? Well, if we start making larger buildings within the overlay districts, that's probably where there are going to be new parking lots. So whatever the size or distinction is to define it, we want to make sure it applies to new mall family, you know, the denser housing in the MBTA districts, but, or anywhere else in town. But I think that's where we're going to see new parking lots. And the other question was? So given a planting plan, how, what's the process? Walk me through the steps to determine, you know, if I got a planting plan like this without the numbers, how would I determine, how would I come up with the numbers?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Susan Stamps - 343</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it's going to be an inexact science. And what we've found is that certain trees with a different density have a different score. It's 100% or 80% or 75%. And then you draw something like that, the sun moves and there's buildings casting shadows and there's what season you're talking about. So it's not going to be exact. But I think what you end up doing is taking a certain density of specific species of trees which typically have a branching radius and have a typical density, but it's not going to be an exact science. I think that's where the tree warden and, you know, planting board comes in. Okay. You know, again, it doesn't seem to be addressed in too much detail in the regulations we looked at. So I think we'd have to make some assumptions and, you know, do our best with certain species at a certain distance apart will provide that shading without being too specific about it. So the Greenberg New York bylaw ordinance has a tree list. Apparently it's not in the document so I haven't actually seen it, but apparently a tree list created, approved by the tree warden or someone in the planning department who's responsible for trees. The guy I talked to there is in the planning department. He's the assistant director. He's also a certified arborist. They have a list of native species and what their expected canopy coverage, canopy would be at 15 years or whatever the requirement was there. And we have a precedent in town now of having to provide a tree plan by developers for approval by the tree warden to show what trees are on a property and what they want to take out, what they're going to leave, how they're going to protect them and all these other things, which the tree warden is very used to working with. And so it's the same concept in building a parking lot is that you're showing what trees you're adding versus what trees you're taking out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a good question. I had a little conversation with Mike Champa about that. Okay. And again, it's a fuzzy line, but basically it means you bring in heavy equipment, you peel off the parking lot and you repave it. So basically repaving so we might want to think about that. Yeah. How about that? You know, top ceiling isn't reconstruction, but ripping it down and then stones and repaving, that would have to be a detail. Yeah, I think we would need to figure out how to say that. Have you talked to the tree warden and gotten his input on this? Yes. He is actually quite enthusiastic about it, as I recall. We just had a very committee meeting last week.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrific. Because, I mean, you know, we just had a big failure at COP 28, and every little bit is going to help. And I think this is every little bit. One of the things that I mentioned to Susan when she and I spoke was the possibility that these are contaminated grounds or even that the parking lot surface is the cap on the contamination. So I think we would especially want to have something in here that says if that's the case, obviously they can't plant trees there. They'd have to use canopies to meet the requirement or get some sort of waiver if there's not adequate sun. But the same problem with planting trees around the perimeter is they may not be able to do it if they're going into contaminated soil or the trees may be shading in 15 years or whatever, the solar panels. So I think we would have to think through what are going to be the exceptions. And I think that's a problem that's already sort of been solved for other excavations, whether it's a street lamp or a perimeter tree or whatever. It would be, yeah, we would have to figure out what to do about this. There are clearly places where you can't plant trees because of the underground contamination, especially if there's activity in the museum. No, no, no, not if there's an activity and use limitation there. You clearly could not do it. We issued a special permit to a project a year or two ago that had six spaces behind the building. And we wouldn't have been able to have six spaces if this were there. I don't know how many spaces we would have had, but we would have probably lost at least two out of the six spaces to do that. I just say that because there aren't many big parking lots in Arlington, and in many cases people try to shoehorn spaces in to get the required minimum number of spaces even after we give them some relief from the number of spaces. So it would be helpful to get an idea of how many fewer parking spaces when you do this. Like what's the ratio of tree area to parking spaces so that we have some idea about how this would work. I think that would be really helpful on this. It talks about if, since you spoke to Mr. Champa about this, if somebody digs up their parking lot and puts a new pavement, does he have to give them a building permit or occupancy permit or any sort of permit? For one of the parking cases that I referred to when speaking with Mr. Klein earlier was basically rebuilding a parking lot, and that did require a building permit. It does? Okay. Yeah. Okay. I just wondered, and this is something to talk to Mike about too, because this, in some places, says building permits will not be, applications will not be processed until these things happen. At another place it says they can't issue a final certificate of occupancy or completion until some of these things happen. If this is in the zoning by-law, then we don't need some of that. But I question whether otherwise this is the right language. And I know a couple years ago we had the AG's office throw out one of our by-laws, zoning by-laws. when it said you can't issue a building permit until this happens and the AG's office said that's not the way it works so I think we need to have a conversation with Mike Champa to understand if this is consistent with what his responsibilities are because he's got the responsibilities to implement the zoning bylaw but he also has responsibilities to implement the building code and I'm not clear like when when there's tension between the that was specifically that was put into it was a reference to the town okay but I still think I would want to be comfortable comfortable that Mike thinks that he would have not have any problem if this is the wording the same thing with stormwater when you're talking about stormwater you're just talking about the fact that the areas with the trees will have rain going in them you're talking about it on the other stormwater management other than that well I thought in what what we've seen are these wonderful municipalities taking the opportunity to create rain gardens right so you have these think of a parking lot and you think about a lane that is trees you know you've got a bunch of parking spaces and then you have a the word is escaping me but a lane of concrete where swell trees are and then parking spaces on the other side and then the median a median type yeah so that that would be planted with trees and in in amongst the trees would be grasses and other kinds of yeah just sort of big rain gardens so you wouldn't have just big squares for the trees it would be a whole engineering for stormwater management and probably around the periphery too and possibly including sloping the pavement sufficiently that it would that the water would go into grates on the sides of the the curbs where the where the trees are so that that the water can be channeled into the roads yeah I mean the town now has a stormwater management plan that well their development has to comply with so yeah okay those are my part of the successful implementation has to do with irrigating your watering trees you know if you water it with stormwater so yeah so so I would want to make sure that Mike thinks he can do this that it makes sense in terms of his responsibilities I would be interested in some idea about how many fewer parking spaces we would have as a result of this to see if it's even doable with some of the small lots which may lead us to a minimum size before this goes in to effect I think we would need some exemptions for contaminated properties where you can't go in to the ground because you'd be violating the state law and regulations on that and same for the shading of the trees and some something if you can't put solar close it's a shady area something like that but I think if we can resolve all those it probably makes sense at least to me at this point I think I think the goal is very valuable I think there are a few implementation questions I have about for example location of trees and the ability to get trees to a healthy mature size is is there room for a root ball of a healthy mature tree in the median of a parking lot without losing so many parking spaces that it becomes financially infeasible is there let's see and and the same is there room for a healthy root ball you know near a building goal here is of course get the shade but get healthy trees right right and I think it's exactly the right goal to get as many trees as possible but but trees that are going to survive on you know West Springfield a little bit and those and those one tree per 12 spaces don't survive past about three or four years can I just respond to that what the so they're they're developing all kinds of ways to plant urban trees now that that aims their roots downward way below the parking lot and then they can spread out to avoid those problems great I'd be very interested in seeing more about that I think that's part of what they're doing in Lexington Center they've done okay with the solar with with the solar I had some concerns about financial feasibility and I think I think there was an article in the Globe today that that flagged some issues with with implementing solar in Massachusetts right now I do think having the having opportunity to go either solar or trees or a mix thereof is a good option but again financial feasibility is something that I'd like to see some more information about I think Jane covered a lot of my questions apart from size and location of trees that could achieve the canopy without undue burden on the parking lot.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm concerned that this is an excellent proposal for a town that is not Arlington specifically because of the size of our parking lots I'm very concerned you know I don't know that we've ever reviewed while I've been on the board reviewed a parking lot that is large enough to have a median within it we typically review parking lots of spaces that are between four and seven spaces and it is a fight to get those spots in in and of itself and I think that as a board we take great pains to ensure that there are significant shade trees I would love you know to be able to do more with education from the from the tree warden and you know working with Green Streets Arlington to make sure that we are ensuring that the applicants include the best species for the buffer areas where we typically have them plant trees but I think that requiring a significant a significant just discontinuity to these already small parking areas becomes an you know an added burden to the developers for quite frankly what would be a very modest gain so I think that rather than adding a section to the bylaw what I'd love to do is to work together so that when we do in the rare occasion you know and hopefully we will have some larger projects come in front of us where we do have some of those larger lots coming from front of us I have found that the developers have been very willing to work with us on planting plans and on configurations of parking lots with within reason and we can push them pretty far and when we have some of these parking lots developed if we have some of these solutions at the at the ready I think it would be an excellent opportunity for us to consult and make sure that we have the appropriate that we work together with them for the appropriate solution I'm not sure that bringing to town meeting a Warren article and updating our bylaws for something that I think would have a very limited application and quite frankly might be a challenge for some of the again very modest developments that we do see I think it would be a challenge and I'm I'm concerned a bit too again because of the fact that we have these small lots they they're asked to do a lot so in a lot of cases they are where the refuse trucks also come through which have a much higher clearance obviously than passenger cars you know they might be for for loading for space I mean through the moving vans are required to come for some of our mixed-use properties and you know the last thing I'd want to do is to require these beautiful shade trees and and then you know I know what happens on my street when those trucks come through and they exactly so I I I I'm I'm supportive of the intent and I'd love to find a way to work together so that when we have an opportunity for a larger lot like you started to depict were able to make the appropriate requirements but personally I I'm I'm not sure that there's a need given that our our typical parking lot sizes in the zoning by-law please well let me let's have Ken and then and then we can take any questions</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;okay when you talk about they're doing trees that want to go down further how they do that is by integrating air okay so they put these PVC tubes along the sides of the tree balls and introduce air down lower so the tree roots can grab air and grow lower because that's how the trees get their roots they grab air from from above and if it's all concrete paved and everything else they have no way of getting air that's how you sort of strangle the tree a little bit so talk about that you know we get a little more detail if you want to get into that type of thing but right now I just don't see this being very appropriate and I'm not you know I want to say I like this but I just can't see this being appropriate for parking lots for new projects they just puts too much of a burden on projects and we don't have those spaces for this to happen that's all okay I have a slightly different take on it I think you might have mentioned this there is a requirement in the zoning bylaw parking areas providing more than 25 spaces shall include landscaped areas in at least 8% of the total paved portion of the parking area and then it goes in from there I think we could build into this some of the requirement for trees provided that it's that again that we're not talking about contaminated land where they would be piercing in into the barrier I don't think it's going to happen very often because there aren't going to be very many places where there are parking lots of more than 25 spaces coming up but I think if we get to that number we can just take this and just add a couple of things about trees. Gene that's specifically in the industrial. No. It's my understanding. That's I don't think so but we have to look at that I don't think so no this is yeah this is different no this isn't the general general parking requirements so we should I would suggest we take a look at this and see if it's somewhere we can add a trees requirement. In the parking lot or in the project because I believe what you're quoting is in the project. No no no no. It says it has to be in the parking lot. Yes parking areas providing more than 25 spaces shall include landscaped areas in at least 8% of the total paved portion of the parking area. Minimum required landscape setbacks and buffers at the perimeter of the parking area shall not be counted toward the landscaping requirement. Individual strips of landscaping shall be at least four feet wide which I think is specific large enough for trees so this is in. So it says trees for landscaping. No I'm suggesting we can add a trees requirement to it. And I guess my question is. It's 6.1.11 D6. I think it's necessary because it will give us a hook into it because right now somebody can say no this is the minimum I'm not going to put trees in it. And we don't give them a special price. I mean I would say that the developers have been very accommodating. The landscaping plan is the first thing they're looking to budge on. It's true. So my question is is this a solution in search of a problem? Well I mean every single time we've asked for a tree or bush or anything like that I've never heard someone said no. Because it's an inexpensive solution that creates goodwill. And I just don't want to put regulations in such a way where it seems ominous. So when someone wants to come here to do this project, I said wow look at these pages of stuff that we have to follow. And what if I mess something up? I'm gonna have to go back again? It's just you know I think one of the goals that we're trying to do with the reconsideration and everything else is just trying to make things simpler to make easier for someone to do things. And I do I mean I agree that tree canopies is important but not in this case for this parking lot. That's the only thing I'm saying. As part of the regulation? Yes. I would support elsewhere and other things. That's not what I'm trying to say here. I'm just saying in the parking lots in this thing I think it's too much of a poison pill for a developer. We'll agree to disagree. We always do. I take the points that you and Mr. Lawick made and I do agree that public space is you know as a municipality that's what we have the most control over.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes I do want to wrap up our discussion. I guess I'm anticipating with MBTA communities overlay this because we're going to get larger structures with bigger parking lots more than we have in the past. We'll see how that happens. Two, people love green parking lot. When you pull into a parking lot in the summer, you look for a tree to park under. But the third thing, you mentioned half an hour ago that you may be pulling apart 6111 because it's a mess. And I'm wondering if this could just be integrated into that rather than try to patch it into something that's already a mess. So maybe that would be an approach to take. I think that's fair. And if I can just add that, yes, it's true. These places we're looking at around the country have lots of big parking lots and lots of space for big parking lots. But we do have some places in Arlington that people chronically complain about because they're so hot that they make walking Mass Ave really unbearable in the summertime. And those areas, for example, are across the street from the high school, west, where those two banks are it's just, it feels like miles of black pavement there. I don't know how- I think though that that's per Kim's comment. We need to work on municipal street trees. Yes. We're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one.

So I think just to wrap this up, it sounds like there is not- again, I don't- I wanted to come back to the board that I don't- Ken and I don't support this article in its current form. It sounds like there is some support from the redevelopment board. So- For a stripped down- For a stripped down version of this. Obviously, if this is an article that you would like to move forward, it wouldn't come under from the redevelopment board. But if it is something that you would like to move forward with, we'd be happy to meet with you again if you do decide- Yes. To move forward with it. We absolutely would like to work with you. Okay. And if you decide not to move forward with it for 2024 town meeting, and I think you made an excellent suggestion about perhaps incorporating some of the elements of this as we start looking at residential and I know that was specific to residential parking, but if it's larger in terms of parking in general, that might be an excellent vehicle for moving some of these concepts forward as well. So, shall we be in touch with the planning director about maybe next steps? I think that we had identified that the transportation planner would be probably the person from the department who would be leading, involved in that effort moving forward. Parking task force or however it is set up. Exactly. So I think that would probably be the appropriate person to follow. Great. We appreciate your time. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you. So the board asked that I take a look at this stuff, take a look at two specific permitted projects at 882 Mass Ave and 455 Mass Ave. And interestingly, kind of right at the same time that the board made this request, 882 Mass Ave was seeking its occupancy permit. And so I was able to speak frequently last week with the developer of the project about deviations from permanent plans. And so what you have, what you see on the screen right now is ultimately what was permitted by the ARB. And then what I have also is a picture that was taken of the project this evening. I think, you know, some of the things that immediately stick out to me are the white accents, which were not included in the original design, as well as the vent penetrations on the Mass Ave. And I think there was a question about the articulation and whether or not the articulation had been done to the plan, meaning where this building sort of comes out towards Mass Ave and pushes in from Mass Ave. It's possible that that was not designed and built deep enough. I think in my conversations with the developer this week, there was an agreement that whatever mitigation this board decides is necessary will be fulfilled by the developer, you know, as part of the awarding of the occupancy permit, which was done Friday at 3 p.m. The architect for the project was invited to this meeting tonight, and I don't believe is here. And so that is, I believe, something that I certainly will follow up with the developer tomorrow about that. But this is an opportunity for the board to sort of weigh in, at least on this project, and any, you know, any outstanding issues or other mitigation items you may want to consider or have you bring up to the developer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you so much. Sure. We will start with Ken. Mayor covered everything that I had concerns about. I think if we go ahead and all the PVC white trim should be painted to match what they presented to us, you know, around the windows to match some of the dark areas around some of the blue areas. It should just blend back in. And then they have these little ticks along the front there. I'm not sure exactly what that is. The vent penetrations. But none of those, yes. And then all the dryer vents and kitchen exhaust vents should be painted up to match where it's penetrating. It's a simple paint job. And unfortunately, it's gonna have to be done in the spring because- It's too cold to paint. It won't, they can paint it, but it just won't stay. Right. And so it's something we'd have to hold over their head until spring. We do have some, I wanna say is, do they have any tenants for the two?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm very disappointed in the way that this was executed. The color scheme was not what was approved. I'm certainly not going to, to Ken's point, ask them to go back and rework the entire color scheme of the building. However, the white accents are absolutely atrocious. And I have no idea why or when those were introduced. I kept waiting for them to be painted. And they never did get there. So I agree, I'd like to see a rendering showing exactly how they will be painted and which colors they will be matching. Because again, to Ken's point around trust and taste, I would like to see what they are going to do before we agree that that is what we will, again, because it differs so substantially from what was approved, we need to see the plan for what they are going to do. And I'd say we need to see that by our next meeting. Understood. So that is January 8th. I also want to see all of those vents removed. None of those were approved. Not just painted, removed. They need to be interior. That is going to disrupt their tenants, but that is not this board's problem. That should have been included within their initial building permit package.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, so the lottery for the affordable units was run erroneously initially and had to be rerun. And not only that, what they discovered was that the location of the affordable units or the units that were identified as affordable were stacked on one side and were less than 700 square feet. And 700 square feet is the minimum size allowable by EOHLC. We were, we. The developer, as far as my understanding, was granted a waiver for unit size and location. Then the lottery was rerun appropriately. I can certainly give you an update on that, but this is my understanding at this time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so our first special condition is that the affordable units shall be equitably dispersed throughout the building, comparable to Marker 8 units in terms of location, quality, character, room size, number of rooms, number of bedrooms. So even if they get a waiver from the state, that's not a waiver from us. And they can't do what you just said they seem to be doing. Understood. Right, so I think that's another issue to bring up to them. And the same with where they are in the building comparable size. So we need to have some conversation, in my opinion, with them about that too. And the same thing about making sure they meet the minimum square foot size. So I think those are important also. And it says that the affordable units had to be approved by the Department of Planning and Community Development. So if they haven't been approved by the department, we should still say no, no matter what waiver they got from EOHLC. And let's have a discussion with them about how they're going to meet the requirements. At least that's my opinion about that. So that's what I would add to what has been said so far. That's a fair comment, yes. Steve?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you've all covered it, nothing further. Can I add one more thing? Yes, of course. Can we ask them to come in to our next meeting? I don't want to seem like we're coming down on you. It's not your fault. We can bring up a special permit. And I would like for them to come in. Yes. Have them explain what happened, listen to what they have to say, and then we can explain to them our frustrations with them, not our frustrations with you. Absolutely understand. Nothing to do with you. I want to make that perfectly clear. So if that's OK, Claire? Rachel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess that's a question I'd like to pose to the board. So I would like to request that they come in front of us with a plan with rendering, again, for how they will comply with the items we just identified. I'm also taking a look at the color of the storefront framing for the storefront windows, which is not correct either. We had approved a dark bronze, and they have what looks like a chrome and anodized aluminum storefront system and entry package. And I'm not excited about the anodized aluminum storefront system in that particular color field there. So again, I agree. I think that we'd like to see a mitigation plan. We could decide as a board tonight to reopen, to vote to reopen the special permit and leave it open until we are satisfied that this is complete. Or we could hold on reopening it if we are satisfied with what they come in front of us with. On the 8th, we can put some time requirements for the execution of those items. And if they are not met, we could reopen the special permit at that time. But I wanted to discuss whether or not the board wanted to recommend reopening the special permit. And I'll start with Eugene, since you side heavily.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is an interesting question. I would like to give them the opportunity to respond. I think that Rachel's suggestion that they come in on the 8th with an appropriate rendering and a mitigation plan, as well as some sort of explanation related to the distribution of the affordable units is good. I think, at this point, what they have committed to is, at least in writing, is whatever mitigation this board thinks is appropriate, they will agree to perform. And I think, where we are right now, we haven't offered them what we haven't told them yet what it is exactly that we're looking for. But I think having them come in on the 8th and saying we are up to and including reopening the special permit is something under consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what I would like to request, and in good faith, they have come back quickly to say we will comply. But I think, again, they owe it to this town to come to the next meeting with the renderings and a schedule and a commitment for meeting all of these items that we just identified and committing in writing to addressing these items, which deviated from what was approved. OK, I'm fine with that. Steve?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the lucky gym, or not the lucky restaurant, no. OK, so you have the list to send to them. And if there's anything else, we will address that and expect them back at the January 8th meeting. And if I may offer one more thing, Mike Ciampa and I had a long discussion about this board and the special permit conditions of this board being included on their checklist of approvals prior to issuing an occupancy permit. And we have been added to that. I know we have been talking a lot about how we're going to keep promises and things like that. So this is a start. At least I will have an opportunity, my team will have an opportunity to inspect the building or inspect the facade prior to issuance of a permit in the future. It might be worth, as well, as a future item for us to build into, whether it's our rules and regulations or something else, what are the consequences for not complying with the special permit?</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 173</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because obviously there are fines and other items that the building department can levy for non-compliance with certain non-conformance issues that they have. But I don't know that we have those levers. And that might be worth discussing with town council and inspectional services. Again, since this is not the first time, this is the most recent, the most egregious recently. But it's something that I think we should, given that that will now be a checklist item. should understand what the and be able to communicate clearly to the folks who come in front of us for a special permit exactly why they need to comply with the conditions and the particular elevations and again I think making sure that they know that at any time when if if things do change you know we can always review you know they can come in front of this board to discuss why and review and seek approval proactively and that is certainly preferred to this particular situation that we all find ourselves in.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay great so that concludes agenda item number five we will now move oh excuse me there was a you also wanted to speak about 455 457. So the board asked for an update on 455 to 457 Mass Ave as it appeared potentially maybe construction had stopped or it is underway they are out there working through the winter as they can but they're still moving forward with the project it is you know moving moving through the system and moving along I guess according to schedule.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in our spare time this summer when we weren't working on MBTA communities my staff and I wrote a grant the community one stop for growth we received a community planning grant in the amount of about $77,000 $77,000 and some change as well as direct local technical assistance award from MAPC to complete a housing feasibility study above future Fox Library and this is something that is that Boston is starting to look at and some other communities are starting to look at how to you know for lack of a lot of vacant public property that we could potentially use to build affordable housing and to build housing you know what could we do on properties that we own so Anna Lytton approached me about the idea of what if we put housing above a future rebuilt Fox Library and I thought it sounded really interesting so we wrote this feasibility grant we were awarded MAPC will be doing the work and what they'll be looking at is essentially feasibility you know developing pro forma you know trying to take a look at disposition you know what would what would disposition of air rights you know what was the structure of that could look like you know how many units how tall what's the neighborhood impact with potential parking underneath just basically any question that may be outstanding related to this project and we don't know honestly if it is feasible or not or something that the town could take on there are certainly lots of ways that this could be achieved but I think what we're looking for is a path forward that works that works in Arlington and that works in the system that we have so some some really good news and I think a pretty interesting project that we'll be taking on in the next few months</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great okay any questions on that I looked at that a while back and you can probably fit in many units up there with no parking and you modulate and you can sit anywhere from 12 to 16 units top of the existing library and you're doing the same thing which is doing what they're doing over the property you know say he's poking a couple of big columns through and that's it and it leaves the library somewhat intact that was in that is pure just air rights and they can send that out as an RFP yeah and sell the air rights</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank you Jean yeah this is terrific I'm really glad you got the grant and are looking into this so congratulations is the Fox library building itself going to be rebuilt too so this could be part of a whole package so it's my understanding that the library building will be demolished and rebuilt rebuilt so this would allow for some more opportunities that's great for the housing itself what are you thinking like a percent of affordable if it can't work financially is affordable will we do market rate right what's your thought about that so I think the feasibility study will you know point us in the right direction what I would like to see is enough units above the library that we could do deeply affordable 30% am I know 50% am I those those type of units I think you know the parking requirements would be less and I think that you know ultimately you would need quite a bit of subsidy in there we would have to that I'm not sure the schedule would work given the way that the projects like that are funded you know with going into the rounds with you know HLC that the subsidy rounds so it may be a project that is market with our inclusionary zoning that's what I was wondering is absolutely applicable yeah okay yeah this is great looking forward to see how this rolls out great Thank You Jean</blockquote>
