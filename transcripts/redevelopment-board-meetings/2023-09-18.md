> Good evening. Welcome to the Town of Redevelopment Board meeting. I'd like to call this meeting to order. This is the September 18th, 2023 meeting. My name is Rachel Zemberi. I am the Chair of the Redevelopment Board. If I could have the other members of the Board please introduce themselves. Steve Rubbelock. Eugene Benson. Ken Lowe. And we also have the Director of Planning and Community Development, Claire Ricker, with us this evening. I will try and project. I know that we don't have mics that pick up our voice, so I would encourage anyone who is having difficulty hearing to please move to the front of the room. We do have some HVAC that's a little bit loud in this room today. Is your microphone even on? It is on to pick up for the ACMI, but it is not a microphone that projects in this room. We don't have that capability in this room.

<details><summary>Docket #3766, 351 Broadway</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 223</summary>

> So at this time we'd like to move to the public hearing for docket number 3766351 Broadway. We are reopening this docket number. This was originally moved to this evening from when it was originally scheduled, and I believe that we have the applicant with us this evening. So I'd like to first provide the applicant with up to 10 minutes for an introductory presentation. Then I will turn it over to Claire Ricker, who will provide an overview on behalf of the Department of Planning and Community Development. Members of the Board will then have an opportunity to ask the applicant questions. We'll then move to public comment, where any member of the public who is interested in providing comment this evening will have an opportunity. And then we'll move back to the Board for deliberation and a decision as to whether or not we'll be able to take a vote this evening. So with that, I'd like to invite the applicant to please join us here in the front of the room, and we will – Claire, if you wouldn't mind turning your microphone around. Maybe Ken and I can share our mic. Great. Thank you so much, Sean. Great. So if you could please introduce yourself. I wasn't expecting to talk so – Just a brief overview would be great.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sean - 245</summary>

> Thank you. I'm with a company called SRP Sun Corporation. I've owned it for 37 years. And Thai Moon is a lovely Thai restaurant that already has been around. They had a fire, and they moved, and COVID happened. I mean, they went out, and COVID happened, and they're back in the space that there was a pasta place. I think it was Twist. Okay. And owned by ACS Development, Patricia Cimboli. They currently have a temporary sign which looks very similar to this, but does not light. I believe the reason that we're here is because the lighting – I understand this type of lighting requires a special permit just in its nature of being channel letters. Is that what's happening? The owner tells me that it's not necessary, but I don't know. The external lighting? These are internally illuminated. Correct. Yes. They're halo-lit. And so it requires a special permit. Okay. So these letters, proposed channel letters, are what we call reverse-channel letters, meaning the letters are opaque. They're fabricated from aluminum. There's lights inside, and it's secondary lighting that's shining against the wall, creating halo. Great. Right. We propose to create that background, which is about 10 feet long by two feet high, that will attach to the existing structure, and that's it. No power. You will see – I mean, you won't see power. You won't see any hardware or fasteners, and it should be pretty seamless and attractive, I think.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 23</summary>

> Great. Thank you very much. So I'd like to turn it over to Claire Ricker for any comments on behalf of the department.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 78</summary>

> Sure. Thank you. So this is an application, obviously, for sign at Thai Moon. The height, they are seeking relief to exceed the maximum width for signage in this area, and they are – and this is an internally illuminated sign, so it's under the jurisdiction of the ARB. They may also need relief on the 60 percent rule related to storefront signage. The width. Excuse me, the width. That's correct, as well as on the awning. Thanks.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 29</summary>

> Great. Thank you very much. So at this point, I'd like to turn it over to members of the board for any questions or preliminary comments, starting with Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 138</summary>

> Sure. When I look at the streetscape there, there's plenty of signs that's already internally lit there, too. I think Cafe Nero and Brickstone Pizza and a few others on either side of them, so I don't see an issue with this being internally lit. And I think the design of this fits in quite well with the rest of the neighbors there. So as far as the awning and internally lit, I have no issues. I'm going to leave it up to the rest of the board to talk about the size. If it's a little smaller, I'm not opposed to that or opposed to just leaving it as is. I think I'm on the fence on that one there. Great. So I'll let the rest of the board see what they say. Great. Thank you, Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 16</summary>

> Gene?  I don't quite understand how this is going to be lit. Can you explain?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sean - 220</summary>

> Oh, sure. Actually, if you don't mind, can I ask you to switch pages?  Okay, if you go to the section, that's the one right there. So I'll stand up and show you. Perfect. Thank you. So this is an existing structure. This is a section of the existing structure. These are rails that are there now. Actually, if you want to go back to the picture above. Actually, the next one, the other direction. Sorry. You can see right here at the glasses place. You were there. Can you see those rails? Right. So those are there now behind this side. So we can go back to the section. Sorry. So these are the rails, right? And we're going to fabricate this as a backer, right? That's the background for the sign. It will be one color. And then this here is a section of a letter. The letter is all aluminum, fabricated, right?  Opaque. But the back of it is clear. Inside the letter is LED lights. The lights shine. And as you can see, the letters are spaced off the sign by an inch or an inch and a quarter, inch and a half spacers. And effectively pushing the light against the backer, which makes a halo effect. You've seen it, I'm sure. They're everywhere.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 19</summary>

> So if this were there and I were to walk up to it, could I actually see the light?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sean - 26</summary>

> Oh, no. Lights are inside the letters. You can't see the light source. Nope. Secondary lighting. So just bouncing off the back door. That's right. 100%.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 12</summary>

> Okay. That's the only question I have. Great. Thank you, Gene. Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 86</summary>

> I just have one question regarding these, and this is really regarding the relief for the width. The third, for the standard, the wall placement standard for a wall sign. Each side has to have 12 inches or 20%, whichever is less. So this is a 13 foot wide storefront. So the maximum allowed width, as I read it, would be 11 feet. They're proposing 11 feet, seven inches. So it looks like we're seven inches too over. 132 inches versus 139. I believe that's correct.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Sean - 27</summary>

> Okay. I don't think it's 139. Can you go to the dimensions? I thought it was 120. Am I reading something wrong? Oh, 139. Just the letters.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 88</summary>

> That's the only thing I wanted to clarify. I mean, I think I would say that the other signs on the block are consistent with it. They're all basically the same size as the storefront, and that what you're talking about, the six inches on either side of the foot are 12 inches on either side. I don't think anyone's doing that very much. But they all may be existing on conforming, but again, the plan of the board is to bring things into compliance when we do.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 53</summary>

> Okay. Steve, did you have any other questions?  Nothing further. Okay. The question that I have is regarding the, if you go to the, Claire, if you scroll down to the photo, the existing photo there, right there, there are gooseneck lights above the sign currently. You're planning on taking those out?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 30</summary>

> I think the owner is planning on taking those out. It would not be in my scope if their electrician would do it, but I think the answer is yes.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 172</summary>

> Okay. I think that would be part of our, at least for me, part of the contingent approval is to not have two sources of light, but to remove the conduit, patch and repair, and et cetera. Okay. That was my question. Please. Oh, that was your question? Sorry. That's great. Great. Any other questions for the applicant before we move to public comment? All right. At this time, any member of the public who has any comment, would like to make any comment on this application, please raise your hand. Great. So we will start with this gentleman right here. I will let everyone know that you will have up to three minutes to address the board. Please introduce yourself by your first, last name and address. So if you wouldn't mind, just, yes, moving to the chair right behind that. And we will ask anyone who's addressing the board this evening to join us in this chair right up here so that the microphone can pick you up. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Michael Ruderman - 194</summary>

> Good evening, members of the board. I'm Michael Ruderman. I live at 9 Alton Street, which is right around the corner from this location. We're probably the nearest or the second nearest residential of Butters. I like the design. I like the fact that it's going to be internally lit. I don't see that there's any possibility of a broad light spillage over the plaza. Nothing that's going to leak back around the corner. So I'm in favor of it. I was going to ask the same point that I believe the chair brought up about cleaning up the cornice by removing the non-functioning light heads there and restoring a clean and finished look above it. We're very happy that Time Moon has found a new location and will take over the space of the late lamented twirl. It's great to see the storefront going to use. I just had one question. I was wondering if anything else in the original special permit is available for questioning. I had a question about traffic patterns in and out. Is that any part of the hearing tonight? It's been something in the neighborhood on our minds.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 32</summary>

> As of now, the board is only taking up the issue of the sign as part of this hearing right now. Thank you. That's all. Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Wagner - 174</summary>

> My name is Carl Wagner. I live on Edge Hill Road. I'm a town meeting member from Precinct 15. I think this is great to see Time Moon coming back. I'm only sorry. I don't know if ACMI can pan around to the paltry showing of people on this particularly wet night who are here who could offer their support. I really have to say the ARB deserves to give Arlington hybrid meetings. There is another issue coming tonight. If you have any comment on this particular application, you are more than welcome. I'm glad to see the word tie and moon with the nice crescent moon there. I think Arlington deserves to be able to comment to you and see what you're doing on this wonderful proposal and on the future things that you're going to address this evening. Many other ARB type boards have already gone to hybrid. I'm out of scope. Thank you very much. I hope people will insist that this ARB go to hybrid meetings. Thank you very much.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 38</summary>

> Are there any other comments this evening? Thank you very much. So at that point, we'll close public comment on this hearing and we'll bring it back to the board for discussion and I will start with Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 109</summary>

> I'm in favor of this. I think it meets the criteria to allow us to do a larger sign because of the architecture of the building and the location of the building relative to the street. I think if the sign was smaller, the letters would disappear. So I'm in favor of that. I think it meets the standard. The standard for the light, which is why I asked the question, is you're allowed to have internally illuminated signs unless there's a directly exposed light source and there's none here. So I'm in favor of this. I agree with the chair about removing the goose neck lamps above it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 300</summary>

> Great. Thank you. Steve? I am also in favor of this. I mean, in terms of the relief sought, it's a small number of inches. There is also a little bit of relief for the width of the awning sign, but they're taking up half the area that they could. So I think that's a fair trade. So I actually do want to clarify for the board what the relief sought is because it's bigger, I think, than we discussed. So what they're seeking for the sign width for the awning, they are allowed on the awning for that to be 60 percent of the width of the awning as the maximum length of the sign. And the same, so the 12 inches or, sorry, let me just go back down to the other section here. With regard to the building sign itself, the 12 inches or 20 percent is actually the vertical dimension. There is the same on the side, but it also indicates that the max is 60 inches or 60 percent of the building width. Again, the way that this is written, I think that the 12 inches we could get to, and we could find that that is appropriate. You see that one, Gene, that sign? Yes. Excellent. Yep. So it's actually a little bit more for the awning that they're looking for in terms of relief than on the sign itself. If we take the 12 inches, it's, I think, just a few inches over as it's shown right now, the building sign. With the awning, they're allowed, my point was that they're allowed one square foot of sign per linear foot of awning, so 13 square feet-ish. And this one, it looks like it's not quite five square feet. So it's a lot less.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 58</summary>

> Ken? I'm fine with it. I'm willing to make a motion. Okay. So we would, let me craft a motion here. Is there a motion to approve docket number 3766 for 351 Broadway with the caveat that the applicant remove the exterior, existing exterior lights and associated conduit, and patch and repair the facade after those are removed?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 76</summary>

> So motion as amended. Is there a second? I second that. And we should just make a finding that the sign, that we're doing this under section C1, for a special sign permit. Great. Thank you. Seeing a second, we will take a roll call vote starting with Steve. Yes. Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. Congratulations. Looking forward to seeing time and return to Burlington. Thank you. Thank you. All right.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Warrant Article Hearings</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 476</summary>

> So at this time, I'd like to move to our second agenda item, which is the public hearing for the Warren articles for fall 2023 special town meeting. Before we begin, I will run through the procedures for this evening. So this is the second of three nights of hearing for a total of 10 Warren articles. Consistent with the past, the ARB will be hearing from the public wishing to speak on these articles as scheduled and only on the articles that are scheduled this evening. So those are the nine that are currently on the agenda. The board will pose any questions to the applicants, but we'll reserve deliberation and voting on recommended action on each article until the last night of hearings, which is October 2nd. As I mentioned before, the subject matter of the hearing is as posted in the agenda. We will be hearing comment on the nine articles listed tonight. We will not take comment on articles that are not posted on this evening's agenda. Anyone wishing to address the redevelopment board on the subject matter of the agenda shall signify that you wish to speak by raising your hand when I announce public comment period is open for each of those articles. After being recognized to speak, you will preface your comments by giving your first last name and your Arlington street address. Anyone addressing the board shall limit your comments or your remarks to two minutes. We will most likely, excuse me, this evening, we most likely will be able to get to all of the speakers. But again, I will keep close track of the time. We will close public comments after each one of the articles has been completed. We welcome anyone who has additional items that they would like to share with the board to please submit comments in writing. We will accept comments, obviously through town meeting, and they are particularly useful as we approach our October 2nd deliberation and voting date. Uh, attendees of public comment shall not applaud or otherwise express approval or disapproval of any statements made. or any action taking place during the hearing this evening. Shall also refrain from interrupting speakers and everyone should conduct themselves in a civil and courteous manner. If an individual repeatedly fails to adhere to this requirement, they will be asked to remove themselves from the public hearing. Speakers should address all questions through myself as the chair. They should not attempt to engage in debate or dialogue with members or other hearing participants. As typical, I will take questions from applicants and save them all until the end of the hearing. And then I will address them at the end. If we determine that there is a clarification required, we'll call on the appropriate person to provide a clarification during the public hearing.

<details><summary>ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT/ OPEN SPACE IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 93</summary>

> At this time, let's go ahead and move into our second agenda item now, which is the warrant articles for fall 2023 special town meeting. So we will start with article B. And what I'd like to do this evening is have Gene present each of the articles. He was kind enough to draft together with Claire, the draft main motion language for each of these articles. So I will turn it over to Gene to introduce article B, which is a zoning bylaw amendment related to open space in the business districts.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 597</summary>

> Yeah, thank you. And thank you to both Claire and Rachel for working with me on these. And none of these are ones where we've actually ever approved the main motions before. So this is in some way, this is the first time we're going to be discussing them. This first one, the open space in the business districts, I did not draft. It was drafted by Kelly Weinemann in anticipation of our bringing this to town meeting in the spring. But then as you know, we didn't bring it to town meeting in the spring. I did change it in a couple of minor ways, one of which was an error that I'll tell you about. But what this proposes to do in capsule form is right now, one can have landscaped open space on a balcony or a roof, as long as it's not more than 10 feet above the level of the lowest store used for dwelling purposes. When we had a conversation in the spring, we decided it didn't make any sense at all to determine where on the building the open space, the landscape space could be. In fact, some of you may have seen photos from around the world that have little green pockets all up and down the sides of buildings and how nice they look and how they add to the green space on the streetscape. So this would allow the opportunity to do that with the open green space. Some of the other changes which we had not discussed and I just put them in because Kelly had put them in were to get rid of the requirement that open space is deemed usable only if at least 75% of the area has a grade of at least 8%, which we'll need to discuss. Now, I accidentally on the next page deleted section 5.3.22C. That section should not be deleted, it's the bottom of the page. Instead, what it should say is for the purposes of this bylaw, the district dimensional requirements for usable open space and landscape open space in all districts except the business district are calculated based on gross floor area. For the business district, C5.5.2B. I'll send that to you, Claire, afterward if you don't have it. And the only other change for that is you'll notice at the end of 5.5.2B, at the bottom of the chart, it says in the business districts, the district's dimensional requirements for landscaped open space and usable open space are calculated based on the lot area, which is what we had talked about many times. The only other difference between what is here and, well, actually there's no other difference between what's here and what Kelly had put into the draft bylaw, so that's what it is. So basically, if we did this, we would allow and encourage in some ways green space up and down the building sides and balconies, on roofs. We would delete the requirement for usable open space for some parts of the business district because for mixed use in the business district. And we had decided to do that because usable open space doesn't have to be green space at all. And very often it could be pavement, asphalt, whatever the building owner wanted it to be. And it didn't make any sense that buildings were constrained that way. And that's why when we discussed this, maybe a year ago, we determined that for mixed use and other permanent uses, usable open space was really not a necessary concept. So that's that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 20</summary>

> Great, thank you, Gene. We'll start with Ken for any questions or comments. I have none. Great, thank you. Steve?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 41</summary>

> Thank you for the clarification that the percentage of lot area is only in the B districts and not the R districts. That was the one concern I have, but it is no longer a concern. That is all, Madam Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 133</summary>

> Great, thank you. And I appreciate that we also made that clarification to confirm that we are prioritizing landscaped open space in the non-residential uses in the business district. Any other comments before we open this particular article up for public comment? All right, seeing none, if there are any members of the public who wish to provide comment, please raise your hands. Please. And I will ask again, if, Claire, if we could just move that chair a little bit closer, we will. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. We will ask that anyone who's speaking with us, please come to the chair here so we can pick you up on the microphone. Reminder again, please introduce yourself by first, last name, and address, and you will have up to two minutes.

> Hi, I'm Laurel Kane. My address is 79 Westmoreland Ave. And I have to say, I'm not super well-versed in this stuff. So, and I've never been to one of these. But in just looking at it and hearing what you said, I have to say the layperson, which is who I am, would understand open space to be not a balcony or a roof. And so I just am wondering, what is the root of this? And it feels, again, at a distance, to be a way of allowing businesses to reduce what I would consider to be open space by implementing, say, a roof garden or a balcony garden. And those are lovely things. But I would hate to see those implemented at the expense of what I would view as actual open space on the ground that one could consider sort of visual or appreciable open space. That's all. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Any others? Please. Thank you, Madam Chair.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 139</summary>

> I'm Carl Wagner from- I'm sorry, what was the? I can't hear anything. Okay, I apologize. We don't have microphones that project. Let me just restart your time, Carl. Just give me one second. So I will just ask anyone who's speaking, and again, that's not going to project. So if you could please put the microphone on the counter. Can ACMI hear me if the microphone is too low? Yes, he absolutely can. If it's pointed at your mouth, it picks you up. Okay. Please leave the microphone. All right, Carl, I'll go this way. He can't be picked up. So again, I would just ask everyone to project. And again, there are seats that are closer, so please feel free to move closer to the front. We're going to do our best to project. Please, go ahead.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Wagner - 362</summary>

> Thank you, Madam Chair. I must admit, as I begin my comments, the opinion of a lot of people is that all of this is suppressing public comment. I'm very unhappy to hear that. But thank you for letting me speak. I'd like to point out that Article B is one of the 2019 density articles. The 2019 density articles, despite six months of public input and lots of public meetings by the director of planning at the time, were determined by town meeting and the people of Arlington to be inappropriate for Arlington and not properly prepared. Particularly, town meetings said that articles like this, which remove open space in the business districts, will be ridiculous. The idea of balconies and roofs being open space, which is what this does. And the town meeting said to the ARB, we will not support this. And Andrew Bunnell, the chair of the ARB, made a famous speech, which is available at video2019.arfur.org. You can still see it on YouTube, where he said, we apologize. The ARB will not bring messages like this or articles like this to the town meeting or to the people unless we have your buy-in and you're adequately aware of this. And I would ask you, Madam Chair, how many public meetings for articles B through J have you had? The answer is zero. This is being rushed through on a rainy night with a few people hearing it. Whereas in 2019, when we said no to you because it wasn't properly prepared, there were three to six months of meetings. This is absolutely ridiculous. People should not be saying open spaces, balconies and roofs when we have a climate crisis and we need to save our permeable spaces, our open spaces for renters and for residents. And this business districts would affect many, many uses beyond business, such as the mixed use. This is absolutely wrong. B through J deserve to be publicly heard by the people and the town meeting. I ask you to reject it and send it back until you've had the director of planning offering to the people of Arlington and the town meeting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 22</summary>

> Your time is up, thank you. Adequate hearing, thank you. Is there anyone else who wishes to speak this evening? Please, come.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Carr-Jones - 149</summary>

> Thank you. I'm Elizabeth Carr-Jones. I live at 1 Lehigh Street here in Arlington. I have some concerns about this. This is a lot I probably don't understand, but one, I would have the question, does this elimination of the open space requirement for certain properties in the business districts, does it mean that that space would be built upon? In other words, not used for something that might actually be of more use to the community, like places where people can gather in cafes or outdoor seating, that sort of thing. I understand there's not a requirement for this open space to be green, but if it's going to be built, it seems to me that's to the detriment of the town in terms of the overall open space that we have available as a community. So, okay, thank you very much. Any other speakers this evening? Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Loretti - 282</summary>

> Thank you, Madam Chair. Chris Floretti, 56 Adams Street. I had understood this to be a public hearing with a time certain of eight o'clock, so I missed Mr. Benson's comments. I'm making my comments based on the revised version of the articles as they were posted this morning. First, I would suggest that the changes to the definition go beyond the scope of the article in that they also apply to non-business districts. This article is supposed to be focused specifically on business districts, but when you change the definition, those definitions also apply to residential districts. What that will allow, and I object to this, both for residential districts and multi-story districts, is usable open space on the roof of multi-story buildings, usable open space on lot areas that are very steep. I can see people in residential districts trying to claim that their roofs are now usable open space simply because they have access to them. I don't think there's any reason why apartment buildings or condos should be exempt from the usable open space requirements merely because they're built in a B district rather than our district. That's what you've come up with, with this type of change that you're proposing. Finally, I would say that by making the changes as they appeared this morning, you provided an explanation that usable open space for business districts is based on the lot area. Now there's no explanation at all of what it's based on for residential areas. You missed that. You're correct. Well, I think that covers it for me, but I think this one really is not ready for prime time. I hope you'll reject it. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Joanne Cullinane - 81</summary>

> Any other comments this evening? Please. Hi, my name is Joanne Cullinane, 69 Newland Road. I just want to say, echo the sentiments of the previous speakers that this seems like a reduction, yet another blow to like a reduction of green space for the town as a whole, and I guess I'll keep it brief. It seems like we're trying to pave over everything in town, every square inch, and it just seems wrongheaded, and I oppose it. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Ratnakar Valanki - 154</summary>

> Any other speakers? Please. My name is Ratnakar Valanki. I live at 21 Adams Street. I am in support. I speak in support of this article. I just want to remind or just make it clear to everyone that we need to move along with times, and this is how an LED or a site, the authorities, bodies that certify projects, so they consider this open space, roof, and let's forget about all those certifying bodies. Let's come back to basics. What is an open space?  As long as it's open to public, it's a space. It's an open space. We live in a three-dimensional world. We forget that height is also dimension. We have farmed on rice terraces vertically. If we can do that, why can't we consider roof terraces, and let's use the third dimension of this planet as well and consider that open space. Thank you. Any other speakers? Please.

<details><summary>	 Matt Miller - 178</summary>

> Matt Miller, 42 Columbia Road, Arlington. I understand what you're saying about three-dimensional space, but a rooftop is not accessible by everyone. I think that accessible green space is what I can access, and if everything is on the roof, then how much green space is there for the public? I question that that is appropriate use of the land, and I wonder if maybe that should be open for discussion from the people in the town. I also think that I moved to Arlington. No, I know I moved to Arlington because this is not Somerville. There is not sidewalks everywhere. There's a reason. There's also better schools. If we have a lot of people moving into this city, what are we going to do about the schools? What are we going to do about the high school? I think that if we were planning ahead with a bigger high school, I think that if we overfill it already, I don't think that's appropriate use of the town resources. That's all I have. Thank you. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Kristen Anderson - 162</summary>

> Any other speakers? Please. Kristen Anderson, 12 Up on Road West. And I just want to ask the board to be cognizant of the fact that since the pandemic happened, people have been congregating outdoors more, especially it's wonderful when we can eat outdoors and avoid transmission of illness. And it would be great if we had more outdoor seating for people to eat out front restaurants. That's all that I would ask because I do that all the time. I ate outdoors, for instance, most recently outside Trist, and it's not as pleasant to sit in the street as it would be on a nice terrace, especially if you could be under a tree. And this is why my favorite place to go is Kickstand Cafe because they have that awesome outdoor terrace that you can be underneath the trees. So I would ask the board to find ways to encourage more outdoor seating for outdoor cafes and restaurants. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 53</summary>

> Thank you. Any other comments? All right. So at this time for Article B, I will turn discussion back to the board. Again, we'll save deliberation for October 2nd. I think that there were a few clarifications that were warranted, and Gene, I'm not sure if you wanted to tackle some of these.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson and Rachel Zsembery - 373</summary>

> There were questions around, let's see, whether or not — I think one item to note is that for usable open space, usable open space does not necessarily — if that remains, that does not necessarily mean that it is open to the public. There's no requirement that easements are provided. I forgot to stop the timer. There are no requirements that easements are provided by the owner. It could be for the use of those who are either working or living within that building at all. So I just want to make that clear that it does not necessarily mean that it is open to the public. Any other clarifications? I think two other clarifications. The bylaw now allows landscape open space to be on a balcony or a roof. It just limits the height. What this would do is get rid of that height so you could have the whole building with green space if you wanted to. So some of that is currently in the bylaw right now. Yes, and there's no public right for use of the land, whether it's landscaped or usable open space. It's the property of the owner of the building who can decide whether the public is allowed on and if so, under what circumstances. Yeah, I think those are the comments. I'll just, do you want to discuss any of the substance tonight? Yep, let's go ahead. I guess a couple of things. I don't know where this, where the at least 75% of the area has a grade of less than 8%, how that got in Kelly's draft, but I left it in so we could discuss whether we wanted to keep the deletion or whether we're comfortable keeping in the 8%. So I think that would be a good topic for discussion. I do have an opinion on that. Please. Overall, I think that striking that would probably remove a lot of non-conformities, just given the number of homes on hills, but given the scope of the article, given that we're really trying to, I think the article is focusing on how open space is regulated in business districts. I would, for now, I'd actually like to un-strike that part. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Various ? - 398</summary>

> You know, one of the things that we can think about doing based upon Mr. Loretty's comment is slightly revise the two changes in the definitions so that they only apply to the business districts to make it more consistent with the scope of the article. And if we did that, would you still want to keep the 8% or would you? I think I'd still be in, I'd have to read it, but I'm sort of inclined to want to keep that part, to un-strike. Anything else, Steve? Nope. Ken. Sorry, what do you want to strike, Steve? Un-strike. What do you want to un-strike?  So there's the current draft strikes the words at least 75% of the area has a grade of less than 8%. I'm proposing that we remove that strike out. I'm fine with that. So if I had a hill, if this project is against a hill, let's say along Pauberville Road, you know, where that's very steep, I'm not saying that's the point, because that's a housing area, okay? Then the slope behind it is greater than 8%. So I can't count that as open space. So that is what we have today, and you're right. It's usable open space, but you could count it as landscaped. Yeah, but we're talking about just usable open space. Okay, so in areas where you're limited that way, let's say you had a nice terraced switchback walking path with little sitting areas or whatever, that can't be used as open space now, because you're limited to just that area. So I think you're limiting the business growth in those areas for this happening. I think we should leave it striked for that reason. And I just think for opportunity, that's all, for that. The only thing that I'll add is usable, this is in the definition. We would have to be specific that it is just struck for the business. So again, if we're removing usable open space in the business, then you're striking it for the residential, which I think is Steve's case to leave it in. Yeah, but the dimensional tables are also a part of this. Yes. And basically, since 5.3.1 is getting stricken, so in the B districts, you just have a landscape open space requirement. So it's sort of moot for the business districts because it doesn't apply there.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 80</summary>

> Understood, but it's still something that again, if the definition applies both to business and residential, so to keep it specific to the business, we would need to keep this in. Right, we could not strike it. Right, so to your point, I think we would unstrike it. Right, right, and we would have to come back next year if we want to do that. Correct, correct. Ken, did you have any other? No. Comments? Gene, anything else, Steve? Nope.
</details></details>
<details><summary>ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT/ REAR YARD SETBACKS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 37</summary>

> Okay, so at that point, we will move on to Article C. Article C is a zoning bylaw amendment related to rear yard setbacks in the business district, and I will again turn it over to Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 256</summary>

> So again, this was the first draft was done by Kelly. I did make a couple changes of it. Now Kelly had three suggestions for us. If you look at the note on the second page, one suggestion is the variable rear yard setback, which is the one I put in. A second suggestion she had was no setback at all, and the third suggestion she had was a standard length setback regardless of the size of the building or anything like that. I chose the variable one because I thought it was the most interesting of the three for us to discuss. The other thing that I did is that Kelly, when she did this, only had it for mixed use and permitted use and other permitted use, and it sort of seemed to me if we were doing for that, we might as well do it for apartments also so it's consistent for buildings of a consistent size. So that's what we've done here. So we're not getting rid of the rear yard setbacks, but if we adopt this, we are making them variable depending on what's in back of the building. If it's just an alleyway, it's one thing. If it's a tall building and it abuts a residential, it's a bigger setback. If it's an even taller building, it's a bigger setback. So it's in some ways similar to what it was before, except now it's more responsive to what's in back and what's the size of the building. So that's it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 40</summary>

> Great, thank you. Steve. I think Mr. Benson made the right choice in choosing variable one. I do like it precisely for the reason it is sensitive to what's there. I think it takes context into account well. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 7</summary>

> Thank you. Ken. I'm okay with it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery and ? - 127</summary>

> Okay. So at this point, any other comments before we open public comment? All right, so at this point, any member of the public who wishes to speak on this article, please raise your hand. Please. Can I ask that this be brought up on the screen so that we can see what Gene was talking about? Sure, absolutely. No worry. I wanted to ask earlier about it. No problem. Here we go. Really the one to look at is the note at the bottom of the chart, I think, Claire. There you go, that's it. The one that's underlined. Great. Did you have any comment or do you want me to come back to you? I don't necessarily have any comment. Thank you. Anyone else? Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Wagner - 157</summary>

> Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm Carl Wagner, Edge Hill Road. I am concerned that like Article B, Article C is being presented with zero public chance for comment and changes such as was done in 2019. This is one of the items that was in the 2019 density articles that the ARB was forced by the town meeting to pull their support for because town meeting felt that it was not properly presented and the town meeting and the town of Arlington did not have proper input. I don't fully understand the changes, but it looks like it's a drastic limitation in the commercial districts, which can include mixed use now. So that means residential also. And I would ask the ARB to reject this and push it to a spring town meeting after the director of planning instituting proper public input meetings and open forums. Thank you very much. Are there any other comments?  Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Aram Holman - 93</summary>

> Thank you. Aram Holman, 12 Whittemore Street. I would echo what Mr. Wagner says. There's a process issue. There has not really been an opportunity for public comment. This is very last minute. That's very antithetical to the spirit of consideration and debate that is typical of Arlington. In addition, this is the kind of discretion that the ARB is trying to give itself, which frankly has rendered it unaccountable and has given people the impression that it's highly arbitrary. I don't think the ARB should have that kind of discretion. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Loretti - 299</summary>

> Thank you. Any other comments? Please. Thank you, Chris Laredi and 56 Adams Street. Some people say that town officials wanna turn Arlington into Somerville. And I was amused in looking at this particular article that when the planning department reviewed the regulations for various other towns, they picked the one that was basically the least restrictive, and that was Somerville. So basically, Somerville's regulation. So basically what is being proposed here is to adopt the Somerville zoning regulations for the rear yard setbacks for business uses. I have a number of problems with these. One, what it means, for example, for mixed-use development, is that you'd have a zero setback for a thing like the bike path, because the bike path is next to a right-of-way. If the right-of-way happens to be a street, then what you've got is a front yard, another front yard, and the rear yard shouldn't even apply. It should be the front yard setbacks that apply. There's also some problems with the way the thing is worded. It talks about having a 30-foot setback if you're above a certain number of stories. And I'm wondering, is that another step-back requirement, or just what does that mean? Is it the entire building that has to be back 30 feet or not? I would also add that rather than being based on the zoning district of the abutting law, it should be based on the use. Because Arlington allows residential uses in business districts, it's more appropriate that it's how the lot adjoining the backyard is being used rather than what the district happens to be. So this one, I think as others preceding me have said, really needs a lot of work, and I would suggest holding off on it for now. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Elizabeth Carr-Jones - 156</summary>

> Thank you. Any other comments? Please. Elizabeth Carr-Jones, 1 Lehigh Street. And if I could just ask you to project as much as you can. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I don't speak that loud. I understand. So I'll do my best. Thank you, that's all I can ask. Okay, thanks. So it looked to me, I haven't looked at this thoroughly, but it looked to me that the only properties that would be protected with this rear setback after this change would be single family homes. Is that correct? Because it looks like everything else is crossed off. We'll clarify. If you have any other comments, yeah, when we get to the end, we'll absolutely clarify that. Yeah, because it needs to be clear that our two districts, which are very often abutting business districts, as you know, would be well protected from building up right next to it. So that was my concern. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 32</summary>

> Thank you. Any other comments? Okay. Seeing none, we will return to the board for any discussion on Article C. And I'll start with Gene for the clarification that was just requested.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 97</summary>

> Yeah, let me just give a couple of clarifications. So Elizabeth, this applies to certain buildings in the business district. So if this building in back abuts a residential district, any residential district, they have to meet the setback requirements, any of them. To a comment that this is discretionary, this basically takes away discretion. Well, there's no discretion here anyhow. It just changes what the setback requirements are to better reflect the size of the building and what's behind the building. So we're attempting to put it in a better context than the context is now.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 31</summary>

> Great. Thank you, Gene. Steve, any additional commentary or thoughts on this article? I don't believe this was ever proposed in 2019. Yeah, I don't think so. That's all I have.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery and Kin Lau - 167</summary>

> Thank you. And this, just for clarification, all of these were originally discussed at several redevelopment board hearings in the winter leading up to ending up on the original Springtown meeting agenda, which were then requested to be moved to the fall because of the numerous articles that were already on the Springtown meeting that were not redevelopment board articles, for clarification. Ken, any questions or thoughts on this particular article? No, I just want to echo the fact that what you just said. I think all these articles, not all, most of these articles, correct Steve, were had the proper hearings and so forth by the planning department for a presentation for the Springtown meeting, but we were asked to not present these and pull these out. It was postponed until the fall. That's what we're doing right now. So that all the zoning articles could be heard together with MBT communities. Okay, any other comments from the board before we move to the next article?
</details></details>
<details><summary>ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT/ STEP BACK REQUIREMENTS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 26</summary>

> Okay, let's move to article D, which is the zoning bylaw amendment related to step-back requirements in the business districts. I'll turn it over to Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 347</summary>

> Okay, so this, I hope, captures what we have talked about more than once at public meetings, which is, number one, the step-back would be along the principal facade of the building and not numerous- Did you get the doctorate? And not numerous sides of the building. Second, and we didn't reach agreement on this, so it's in here so that we can discuss it. Should the step-back be on the fifth floor or the fourth floor? Right now, it's on the fourth floor. This proposes to put up on the fifth floor. That's for discussion. I clarified for a building with street frontage on Mass Ave or Broadway, the principal facade and principal property line are presumed to be facing Mass Ave or Broadway. Unless we determine otherwise, that gets rid of the, you know, it's on two corners, which is the principal facade. And we say the other thing where we have disagreed with each other on how to interpret the bylaw in the past. It now says that it must be measured from the principal property line. It may be on the fifth floor or a combination of various story setbacks, so the fifth story is set back the required amount. So that means they could pull the entire building back seven and a half feet if they wanted to. They could pull the second floor back three feet and another floor back four feet. So when you get to the floor with the step-back, you've reached the seven and a half feet. The only other thing I did is the step-back requirements were located exactly the same almost in two parts of the zoning bylaw. So I deleted the second one, which was 5.3.21c because it was the same thing that was in 5.3.17, and then we just re-lobbed, re-lettered what had been D and E to C and D. So I think the discussion for us really to have is it on the fifth floor or fourth floor, and are we comfortable with allowing the step-backs to build up toward that floor?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 8</summary>

> Great, thank you, Gene. We'll start with Ken.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 171</summary>

> I was always on board to measure the step- setback from the property line, as many discussions, and I was also on the line that the fifth floor setback should be seven and a half feet, irregardless of what's happening on the lower floors. It could be up along the property line, or it could be set back from the property line. It doesn't matter. It's the top floor, which is actually the floor that's casting shadow or casting whatever onto the street. That setback's seven and a half feet. So I'm not clear. Are you saying if the building is pulled back seven and a half feet, the fifth floor would have to pull back another seven and a half feet? No. Okay, so it would just be cumulative. Cumulative. Okay. Got it. Yes. Okay. And that's what you have it here. That's the way it is. Yes. I'm just saying I agree with everything's here. So fourth floor or fifth floor?  Fifth floor. You want the fifth floor.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 142</summary>

> Steve? So there, I have two or three comments. One, the sentence, this requirement shall not apply to the buildings in the industrial district. We don't need that because the industrial district has the... Right, but I'm hesitant to... The industrial districts, yeah, it is a different set of rules, but there are no setback requirements in the industrial district. So I would ask that we consider restoring that sentence. In terms of where the setback is measured from, I would have actually preferred to say that it is an increase over the yard setback. But since in these cases the yard setback is zero, it's okay to say measuring from the property line because it's the same difference. In terms of fourth or fifth story, I'm on the fence at the moment. So I'm on the fence, that's all. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 131</summary>

> I agree with Steve. I have no issue with our current requirements of the fourth floor. I think that it provides an opportunity for a more dynamic facade in terms of the height that we currently have permitted within our zoning bylaw and the FAR modifications that were made recently as well. So you would put it at the fourth? I would keep it at the fourth floor. Yeah, I would too, sure. So, I mean, that's something that we can continue to discuss this evening after public comment and then obviously again on the second. Any other initial comments before we open this up to public comment? No? Okay, great. If there are any members of the public who wish to speak on this article, please raise your hand. Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Aram Holman - 97</summary>

> Aram Holman, 12 Pittermore Street. I, again, do not think this is a good idea. I think the critical thing here, as I am reading the original and comparing it to what you're proposing, the original says that the setback shall be provided along all building elevations. You are now limiting the setback to only one side of the building. I think that's rather poor treatment of people on the side streets, limiting this only to Mass Ave or Broadway. I think that does people on the side streets a disservice. Thank you. Any other comments? Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Laurel Cain - 127</summary>

> Hi, my name is Laurel Cain, 79 Westmoreland Ave, and it's really just a comment to say that, again, as the layperson, this stuff is really hard to understand, and I respect that you have the hearing and are opening up for public comment, but for someone like me to even make an informed comment, I don't even really understand this, and I'm just, as a general comment, is there a mechanism by which the complex work that you do could be translated, say, by an illustration, a picture, or some layer that makes it more accessible for people to understand what it is that you're proposing, and that's, I guess, a general comment, not probably specific to this. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments? Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Loretti - 240</summary>

> Thank you. Chris Loretty, 56 Adams Street. I think it's important to remember, back when the stepbacks were sold to town meeting, and they were sold to town meeting as a way of ameliorating the higher building heights that were allowed under other zoning changes, and the expressed intent was to have those stepbacks on all street frontages, not just on one street, and also to start them at the fourth floor, and I think that's where they should remain. Most residents in town don't even want five-story buildings on Mass Ave and Broadway, and the master planning process showed that. I think it's arbitrary to define the principal facades on Broadway or Mass Ave. For a lot of these lots, particularly on Broadway, the longest street frontage is going to be on the side streets, and those side streets are typically less wide than Broadway or Mass Ave is. Those are the ones that really need the stepback, not the major thoroughfares, so I believe they should remain on both sides, and particularly if you're keeping them at just seven and a half feet from the property line, that's really minimal. A lot of buildings are not built right up to the property line, so it's not a significant ask to do that. So I think this should be left, this bylaw change should not be made at all, and I look forward to arguing that at town meeting.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 26</summary>

> Any other comments? Okay. So at this time, I'll turn it back to the board for any other clarifications or comments, and we'll start with Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 117</summary>

> I think the only clarification, first, I understand that this is a difficult topic. I taught zoning law, planning law for about a decade, and I know the time it took the students who were graduate students to get up to speed on it, so I understand that. Pictures would help. Pictures would help. The only thing, other thing I'll say is we're not saying the principal, facade, and property line are Mass Ave or Broadway, we're saying they're presumed to be, but that can be changed. So if it's a little bit on Broadway and a lot on the side street, we can determine that that's a more appropriate place. So that's the only other clarification.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 70</summary>

> Great. Thank you. Kim? No. Steve?  So in terms of four versus five, I think we landed on four. Well, we gave it, sorry. Gene and I, I think, were comfortable with four. You were on the fence, and Kim is interested in us moving to five. So I think that's still up for discussion. Okay. I will join you on the four side. Okay. Any other discussion? No.
</details></details>
<details><summary>ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT/ REDUCED HEIGHT BUFFER AREA</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 28</summary>

> Okay. Let's move to the next Article E, which is the Zoning By-law Amendment related to reduced height buffer area, and I'll turn this one over to Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 129</summary>

> Okay. This is exactly what Kelly drafted a long time ago. I've said this to Rachel. If you look at the Warren article, it says 5.5.2. I looked all over 5.5.2, and I could find nothing to amend to put it in scope. So you see what this says. I'm not sure the lower height numbers make a lot of sense, but I just don't think this is in scope, and I don't think we should go along with it. Thank you, Gene. As Gene and I were looking with this one, I agreed with that as well. We can certainly talk about it, but I would be interested in us discussing this one a little bit further and perhaps coming back in the spring with a modified article.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 92</summary>

> Kim? Did we talk about this before? We did. This was one of the articles that we had on for the spring. We talked about it before, but we didn't talk about the lower height numbers. Again, I think there's a mismatch between the Warren article and what we've done here. So you're saying your suggestion is to go ahead and strike this from this fall? To vote no action and to not move this one forward until we have more opportunity to explore this one further. I'd be okay with that.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 189</summary>

> Steve? So this one is actually interesting. The height buffer areas, or the height buffer distances, were in the 1975 version of this by-law, where the planned unit development district allowed 200-foot buildings, and the R7 and B5 allowed 110 feet. Now, each of those zoning districts was down-zoned some later year in the 70s and 80s, but no one ever moved the height buffer. The last one, I've tried to chase down as much primary source documents like ARB minutes, town meeting transcripts, to see if it was ever discussed, and it was never discussed. So this just seems like an internal inconsistency that crept up over a couple of years of successive down-zonings. But in terms of just the geometry of the triangle, we've changed the height, but we haven't changed the base. And I think it's worth at least changing, in the spring perhaps, changing the base to get back to where it originally was. That's fair. I think that was the original intent. I think that, again, with the specific lower height that we're looking to achieve, that some additional study would be beneficial. Yeah.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 57</summary>

> Yeah. Okay. Any other comment? Well, it's not just a clarification. Not lower height we're seeking to achieve, but the lower height that prior town meetings adopted. Yes. I'm sorry. It was not clear. That's correct. That's correct. Okay. So at this point, I'll open this up for public comment. Any comment on this particular article? Please.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Carl Wagner - 282</summary>

> Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm Carl Wagner, Precinct 15 Town Meeting Member and Edge Hill Road resident. This is another of the articles that were before the town meeting in 2019 and which were given extensive chance for the public to hear about them, if not to change them, by the Planning Director in the 2018-2019 period. I don't know if people online can see or if the 13 members of the public that showed up here for this can see, but you're proposing, the Town of Arlington is proposing for the ARB to reduce the height buffers by three quarters. And people who live in single, two-family, or people who appreciate open space that back up against these buildings are going to have enormous buildings that are being proposed by other articles, the MBTA density overlay, much, much closer to them. And the big problem is, despite words to the contrary, I think it really is bogus, to say that any of this was given to the town prior to the spring town meeting. This has not been open to meetings like these 13 people here. We are seeing this for the first time, and I ask the ARB respectfully to vote no action on B, C, and this, D, as well as the rest of these items, and push them to a spring town meeting, and ask the Planning Director and the town, which works for the businesses and the residents of Arlington, to give presentations where people can give proper input. This is a rush job, and we don't deserve this. These volunteers do not deserve having to have an employee that works for me doing this. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Aram Holman - 128</summary>

> Any other comments? Please. Thank you. Aram Holman, 12 Whittemore Street. I second what the previous speaker said, and I do not think the Redevelopment Board should have this kind of discretion. A previous speaker, two speakers ago, just said this is highly technical, difficult to understand, and some pictures would really help. I think that with the delay in doing this, you not only could allow the public debate, you could put together some visuals, some pictures, which explains what this is, so that people will get a handle on it. I think if this passes, it will add to the popular perception that the Redevelopment Board is a body that is simply responsive to developers, but not to the citizens who pay for it. Thank you.

> Any other comments?  Please. Thank you. Chris Loretti, 56 Adams Street. Again, I think just to echo Mr. Benson's comments, the way the bylaw language change is put in is way outside the scope of the article, which deals with variable rear yard setbacks. I'm assuming that's why you don't want to go forward with this, and I would completely support that. But even thinking about this in the future for the spring, what's proposed completely eviscerates the height buffer. This reference to not being detrimental based upon criteria established in Section 3.3.3 and 3.3.4 is completely meaningless, because those sections have absolutely nothing to do with the height of the building or relevant criteria of things like solar access. If the Redevelopment Board wants to get rid of height buffer areas, they ought to just put that before a town meeting and be honest about it, rather than doing away with it the way it's done here. But you really don't need to do that, because you already have the power on a case-by-case basis just to waive the height buffer area if you can show, or if you can find rather, that the abutting properties are not adversely affected. And if you can't find that, if the ZBA can't find that, then I think you really need to ask yourselves why you would want to do away with it. Thank you.

> Thank you. Any other comments? All right. All right. At this time, we will move back to discussion by the Board. I will start with Gene. Just for clarification for people who don't understand this, in a very few places in the Zoning By-law, buildings can be two different heights. What this says is if you have two different height options, you have to use the lower height option if you're within a certain number of feet, of some of the residential districts. Unless, in this case, the ARB finds it's not detrimental. This is basically changing the wording, changing the height, but we're not bringing this to town meeting. It's not ready to go to town meeting. Great. Thank you, Gene. Steve, any additional comment? Nope. Ken? No. Great. Thank you.

</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 122</summary>

> Okay. You can read it. It's only three sentences that's added. It basically says that in the business districts, the setbacks are the setbacks prescribed in the business district, and not the setback from farther down the street in the residential district. This has come up a lot of times where we've had to waive this because the building is either already there or it sort of doesn't make any sense to not give it the ability to go to the property line and there's no adverse impact. So we had discussed that this was just a way to clarify that this is the way we have been doing this up to this point and makes it easier for everyone to understand.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 121</summary>

> Great. So thank you, Gene. Ken? Yeah. Can I ask? I know it's only a couple sentences. I just want to make sure I'm perfectly clear what's going on here. So the two sides of the building facing the street are considered front yard setbacks. The other two sides of that, let's say, square property, is considered side yard setbacks. So there is no rear yard setback on the corner lot. That hasn't changed. That has not changed. Okay. So all we're saying is that the two front yards continue all the way down to the end of that front yard. So that's a step back. There's nothing about step backs. It doesn't address what's next to it on that street.

</details>
<details><summary>	 Crystal Ready? - 245</summary>

> Thank You crystal ready Adam Street, I find this one completely unacceptable I think it's important for people to understand that it's not the properties down the street. It's the abutting properties, so if you're on a side street You know in next to a corner lot, and there's a mixed-use development going up There's zero front yard setback and zero side yard setback, and you could have a five-story building built right next to you Unfortunately the Development that the redevelopment board approved for called mystic wine On Broadway isn't very far along in its construction But I wish it had been much farther along as people could really see what sort of damage this type of change allows And I thought I was a bit amused that Mr.. Benson mentioned You are giving waivers if you think you have the power to give waivers Why do you even need this zoning change of course you really don't have that power, and you're not going to have a town council Or hopefully you won't have a town council very soon that thinks you have that power either so I think you ought to scrap this and And go back to the drawing board, this is one that's Potentially very damaging to people who live in homes next to Mass Ave When lots next to Mass Ave or Broadway and even what even homes that are interspersed with business lots on those roads as well

Thank you All right, thank you Miller 42 Columbia Road My thought is just if it could be brought up in discussion by by air be what happens here for like snow removal, and I know that if you have a building that is There's buildings down on Broadway that are a concern Because you can't really see around when you're making a right turn You know there's a lot of traffic sometimes on that road, and so I think that if we change it It would be worth considering if there's going to be impact on traffic, and you know because we are talking about what's evident Eventually going to have higher traffic going through the roads Not that we need to study or delay or anything, but it needs to be a consideration So I just hope that that's something that is being discussed with you guys.

It's a couple of things. I just wanted to send record that I'm in favor of this and To other speakers right who brought up traffic concerns and others. I just wanted to give a number in 1970 as per us census 1970 this town had 17% more population than what it is today and this town had 10 percentage points more people who are under 18 living in this town, so this town has supported far more people far more vehicles and Far more density than what it is there today So I don't think we should be worried about you know traffic and other concerns that this will bring in. I'm in favor of this Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 36</summary>

> Thank you any other comments All Right at this time I will turn it back to discussion for the board and Steve I believe that you were interested in addressing the question regarding Corner lot visibility.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 315</summary>

> Yes, so I actually have two follow-up comments, but I'll start with that one Please so the requirements for court for visibility Visibility around corner lots only apply in the our districts. So this That it's it's what the bylaw says But it's only in the it's only in the our district So there's you need a 20-foot line of 20-foot line of sight from the corner back with a free with a clear height of Between three feet and seven feet above the curve, but it's only a residential district requirement. It's not a business requirement Should we explain why in terms of the street width and sidewalk with do you want to just address? So I'll let you take that sure so really that has to do a lot with the with the narrower roads and the narrower sidewalk with Etc within the residential lots white which is why it is in that section and not in some of the business districts were to deal with wider roads such as Mass Ave and and Broadway in that area And the second thing I wanted to mention there is a section in the bylaw which It's five three sixteen if anyone matters, but during during the environmental design review We do have the ability to make adjustments to yard setbacks. So what's proposed here is basically just taking what we've generally been doing and Making it more obvious to people Yet the the other thing I will add is because you probably know that in a lot of Places the older homes don't meet the current standards for lot size setbacks things like that So you could have a street with a lot of older homes with 10 feet setbacks Even though the requirement is 15 But you require the building on Mass Ave corner to have a 15-foot setback a little bit crazy

<details><summary>ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT / HEIGHT AND STORY MINIMUMS IN BUSINESS DISTRICTS</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 22</summary>

> Okay Let's go to Article G which is the zoning bylaw amendment related to height and story minimums in the business district
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 237</summary>

> So we had this discussion we had this discussion at a Clip you move it to the next one. Thank you. We had this discussion at a few of our meetings When One place came to us they wanted to build a new building only one story high on Mass Ave And we felt like we didn't have the authority to say no But it really doesn't make a lot of sense these days to have one-story buildings on on Mass Ave or Broadway Anymore. So what this basically does is say in the business districts buildings shall have a minimum of two stories in 26 feet in height both stories shall be usable doesn't apply to single-family residential buildings The reason it does not is there's something in chapter 48 that says we can't regulate the interior size of a single-family residential building and I'm concerned that It could be interpreted for two stories. So for safety's sake we're not applying it to single-family Residential buildings and we can waive it or modify it if it's infeasible For example, if somebody wanted to put a new gas station Somewhere we would say sure, you know, you don't have to put apartments above the gas station The only thing I would ask you is I chose 26 feet in height You should decide whether that's an appropriate height to go along with the two stories That's it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 64</summary>

> Thank you, Gene. The only thing that I will mention too is that if we move forward with the with article I Then we would not need the section Except this might pass and I may not. That's what I'm saying. But yes, it's it's just right We can remove it next year. Right exactly so that the two might be interdependent Okay, Steve
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 156</summary>

> One of the I was The earlier version of this Had tables which said 25 feet and the text that said 26 I'm okay with either of them as long as we pick one We don't have the table anymore. So Yeah, I'm I'm no no questions great kid And answer your question earlier G What I think okay is for a Retail business or business district For an office is much small but say for retail that Good height is like 14 to 18 feet clear. So 14 18 feet floor floor would be a comfortable Level for a residential for a retail space and Then add another floor 26. I think the number you select is quite comfortable. I'm just trying to say I'm okay with that And I think that that is consistent with elsewhere where 13 feet floor-to-floor has been what we have been adopting within the other sections of the bylaw

I've heard this board many times talk about Not wanting to restrict the flexibility of different businesses and different You know development opportunities in town. I found myself thinking well, you know, what if somebody wanted to open up a You know a little like greenhouse business like was it? Pemberton, you know on Mass Ave in in Cambridge That you wouldn't allow that yes, if this went through um, I don't understand why it would would help To restrict certain types of businesses that might want to open up here Unnecessarily

<details><summary>	 Carl Wagner - 189</summary>

> Madam Chair, I'm Carl Wagner precinct 15 town meeting member and Edge Hill Road resident The problem with these articles and this one particularly is that the business renters and the business owners Don't know you're doing this. I should say you're doing this and that the ARB is forced to review this We're sitting here with very few people. This may be an okay proposal. I'm not a business renter or owner it strikes me that you're instituting a Restriction on on business owners and that will probably result if it goes through in business Buildings being sold and us losing more and more of our struggling businesses So I'm concerned about that The main thing is that the people of Arlington the taxpayers who are businesses and residents deserve to have this discussed Over a period of meetings not in one rainy session at the ARB in a rush job before a special town meeting I ask you like with the other Articles that are before you this evening to push this to town meeting in the spring and to vote no action on this. Thank you

<details><summary>	 Aram Holman - 324</summary>

> Thank you. Any other comments, please? Aram Holman 12 with a more street town meeting member precinct 6 again, I think that Giving the redevelopment board this kind of rediscretion this kind of discretion allows for the public perception that the redevelopment board can be swayed by developers and lawyers But not ordinary residents. I urge you to vote no on this. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments?  Okay, seeing none we will turn this back to the board There was a question about the restriction of flexibility. Gene if you can talk about how that still remains within this The way that this is is written. That would be helpful. It's the second sentence which says we may make way of a modified Heighten story requirements. So in the example of the Pemberton farms thing We have the ability to say okay, that's fine You know, it's it's it's interesting because zoning is always a little bit of a tug between How much do you want? Allow people to do what they want with their land and how much are there certain? Limits that for the sake of the town and what we think the town is and should be Need to be modified For the sake of the town and what we think the town is and should be need to be there We I think in the past and discussing this had felt like no limitations in the business district Allowing one-story buildings where there could have been more was a big mistake and it was an opportunity To say if you're going to build a new building It has to be at least two stories high This does not require any of the one-story buildings to get torn down or a second story to be built I won't just be considering non-conforming and for the rest of their existence They can continue to exist as one-story Thank You,

> Then let's move on to Article H, which is an administrative correction, Jean. All right, so this is pretty simple last year town meeting deleted a paragraph from Section eight point one point three and it re-lettered the other paragraphs Accordingly, so what had been paragraph E is now paragraph D So now we just have to go back now that that was done and amend the one reference So there's one reference that says Refers eight point one point three E. There's no longer eight point one point three E Last year, it was re-lettered at eight point one point three D. So this just makes that administrative correction Thank You, Jean any Comments, Ken?

</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 332</summary>

> Okay, so this this is fairly simple, but Very interesting, let's say. So right now You're allowed to build a single-family home or a two-family dwelling duplex dwelling in any of the business districts As of right and as you know, there are some in the business districts as of right in thinking about Mass Ave and Broadway and the other small places with business districts and A lot of discussions the board has had over time The thought was it doesn't really make a lot of sense to allow new single-family or two-family buildings in the business districts So the business districts hopefully will be much more for business than they are for small single and two-family homes So all this basically does is say there's no more right to build Single-family and two-family in those districts you can however keep them. They'll just become nonconforming uses You don't have to get rid of them If you want to put a do you on them you can still put an ADU on them we didn't change those requirements There there is one thing that I went back and forth about and I think the board should have some discussion about There are a lot of tables in the business district for height setbacks dimensions At first I went through all of those and crossed out single-family two-family and duplex and Then when I redid this I said no No I shouldn't do that because they're still there as nonconforming uses and we should still as structures I'm sorry, not conforming and Uses and therefore we should still have What the dimensions the setbacks things like that up because if we don't have them all of a sudden they could decide they're gonna Go to the property line Higher etc. So after a lot of consideration and some of you may think I've made a mistake with this I decided just to change the use tables and none of the dimensional tables

<details><summary>	 Kin Lau - 78</summary>

> Thank you, Gene. Starting with Ken. I'm in agreement with you, Gene. I think giving the restrictions in for the one and two story families in the business is good. Just in case they're not performing, but we should keep them as not performing existing, not so they can expand upon it. I agree with Mr. Benson with regard to leaving the single family, two family duplex in the dimensional tables. I think that that's a good foresight.

> Thank you, Madam Chair. Carl Wagner, precinct 15 town meeting member and Edge Hill Road resident was just whispering with another member of the public here because the public are not aware of what exactly this is and it sounds like it's not properly presented or researched. I am part owner of a business district single family home. The people of Arlington should be aware that it appears what's happening here in this muddle is that you will be prevented in the future from building a single family or two family if you wanted to in the business districts, but you will, of course, not be prevented if you are a large developer from doing mixed use. I think that changes like this may not be wrong, Madam Chair, but I think that the town is a democracy and the town meeting members deserve, especially if they live in these B districts in non-conforming residential uses or if they have constituents who live in these areas. People deserve to have a debate and a discussion about this that's not being provided in this charade tonight and I ask you, therefore, to push it to Springtown meeting, have meetings and vote no action on this. Thank you.

> Thank you. Any other discussion? Please, in the back. Hi, Matt Miller, 42 Columbia Road. I agree with what was just stated. I think that there should be a reason for such a change in the regulation. Maybe it's because the town wants more revenue from businesses, that's fine, but I haven't heard of reason for a change such as this and this could prevent potential future business owners from building a house. There's places like, I don't know, you look at DeVito's Funeral Home, that was a house, I'm sure. There's a certain understanding that I think the people of Arlington should understand and I haven't been presented with a reason. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Chris Loretti - 371</summary>

> Thank you. Chris Lordy. Thank you, Chris Lordy. Sorry. I'm trying to start my clock. Adam Street. I guess the one word I would describe this article as is ahistorical. Section 5.3, 5.5.1 on districts and purposes is describing the zoning districts as they are, not how you would like them to be. And I think that's a good way to put it. I think that's a good way to put it. I think that's a good way to put it. As they are, not how you would like them to be. So when it says the B1 district is predominantly one and two family houses, which may be used solely as homes, or they are one or two family homes that may be used as homes, offices, or a combination of the two, and that's because they were constructed as homes years ago, either before zoning, came to Arlington, or shortly thereafter. And these are homes that people use. You know, they change from one to the other. And that's what most of the B1 district is. I don't see any need to ban those homes and make them nonconforming. I would question how often new one and two family homes are being constructed in the B district. I sure don't see them. And what you're doing is burdening all those people who already own those homes. You're not continuing their nonconformity. You're making them nonconforming. So if there's a business in one of these homes, that home cannot be converted back to residential use by right. Or you can't convert a one family to a two family by right in that zone anymore once you make that change. So I would leave you with two questions. One, did you notify all the property owners of one and two family homes in the business districts about this change and the fact that you might be making their homes nonconforming? And just how many one and two family homes, new homes, not replacement, new homes, have been constructed in the business districts in the past five years? Because this article seems more driven by ideology than by history or the fact of the way development's occurring in Arlington today. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Aram Holman - 161</summary>

> Thank you. Thank you. Please. Aram Holman, 12 Whittemore Street. Town meeting member, precinct six. My comments echo what previous commenters said. I think this will incentivize those owners of houses in the business district to, as their houses age, build something else which will be much larger, which will be comparable to the ugly sardine can built between the high school and stop and shop, which you approve. And those buildings that are now there were protected because the lots were relatively small. They cannot support the kind of sardine can model you have approved. So there is no need for this article. People are perfectly capable of tearing these down and building larger edifices without being given the burden of being made nonconforming. So I respectfully say this article should not pass and at the very least, it should pass as with all of these with considerably more public discussion and debate than you are having now. Thank you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 20</summary>

> Thank you. Any other comments? Okay. I'll turn it back to the board for discussion and I'll start with Gene.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 147</summary>

> Just a couple of things. So 5.5.1 is districts and purposes. So I'm sure if we didn't amend 5.5.1 to get rid of one and two family in that, we would be criticized for having left it as a purpose. And that's why I did the deletion from 5.5.1. Again, this does not require anyone to tear down a house. It does not incentivize anyone to tear down a house. It doesn't make the small lots bigger. So all of a sudden they can build mixed use. All it does is say, and they can all stay there as one or two families. All it basically says is in our business districts, we have enough one and two family houses and we need more business properties. And as Steve said about the other thing, let's get some more growth in town to help with our tax cuts.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 75</summary>

> Steve? Can you say that again? Yeah, well, sure, I'll say it again. Again, I think we're, where I feel we're coming out as a board is we want to ensure that properties in the business districts stay used as businesses. And where possible, we would like to encourage when as properties turn over and are redeveloped, higher value, more tax generating properties than less expensive, lower tax generating properties. Thank you. Thank you, Steve.

<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 236</summary>

> Ken? No, I'm all set. Great. I will also remind everyone that in addition to the hearing today and the discussion that has been, that has taken place at meetings prior today, today on all these articles, that the place when this debate occurs is at town meeting. Town meeting is the body that votes and decides on whether to pass these articles or not. That does not happen solely through the recommendation of the redevelopment board. So in case that has been unclear through the comments that have been made this evening, I do want to address that. I also want to address, there have been some pointed comments that these have been driven by the director of planning and community development. These articles that have all been presented this evening have been brought about through the discussion with public and with the members of the redevelopment board in concert with the excellent staff that we have in the department of planning, community development. It has been a joint effort that supports our master plan and many of the other documents that we've adopted as a town, by town meeting, and through much public debate. Steve? I was going to say, I think a few of them, these articles predate the current director of planning and community development. Thank you for the clarification. Any other comments on this article before we move to the last?
</details></details>
<details><summary>ZONING BYLAW AMENDMENT / STREET TREES</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 17</summary>

> Okay. Let us move to article J, which is the zoning bylaw amendment related to street trees.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 261</summary>

> Couple of years ago, town meeting adopted a zoning bylaw amendment requiring street trees in the business districts for redevelopment at least every 25 literate feet of lot frontage. This year, Claire, can you, he's asking you to screen him. Thank you. This year, based on some comments we got from, I think it's called Green Streets Arlington, about the need for more street trees and what to do if MBTA communities passes with those residential places, the need for better street canopy. We have amended the current bylaw to apply it to both residential districts too. In addition, since all of the previous ones were subject to review by the redevelopment board, but not everything in the residential district is, we've expanded that. So if it's a case in front of the zoning board of appeals, let's say it's a request for a special permit from them, they would have the ability to say, okay, you don't need to put the trees there for whatever reasons are here. If it's not in the jurisdiction of the redevelopment board or the zoning board of appeals, then the department of planning and community development could make the decision. And we have not changed the criteria for the decision making about when a tree is not required, but it's basically where there's no other suitable location, there can be a payment to the tree fund instead. So the criteria haven't changed. It's just basically applying it to residential and deciding who gets to decide if there's going to be a waiver. That's it.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Kin Lau and Eugene Benson - 186</summary>

> Thank you. Gene, Steve. No comments, questions at the moment. Great, Ken. Just one, there was one section there where the redevelopment board and the zoning board may grant an increase in spacing if there's a conflict with existing trees. I didn't change that at all. I realized that. I'm just bringing that up, Gene. Because it also says that it seems like it may get too dense and there's too many trees because they don't get a chance to grow if you get them too dense. Well, that's why this is every 25 linear feet. Yes, but you're saying we can increase it if there's existing trees. That increase the number of trees, increase the spacing between them. So greater than 25. Okay, fair enough. I was just reading that. You left out the word spacing. Yes, all right. I do like the part that you did add about where it is not feasible, then there's other ways to go about by either putting into a fund, plant trees elsewhere, stuff like that. But not to say it's not feasible, we're not gonna do it.

This was something that Green Streets Arlington, which is members of the Open Space Committee, the Tree Committee, and the Finance Committee put before the planning board, or the planning department through their representative and we are grateful to see this happen now, especially with the MBTA communities coming online. It's really important and we'd be glad to hear any further questions you might have on how it should be implemented. Great, thank you. Thanks.

> Anyone else? Chris?  Yeah. Kristen Anderson, 12 Oakland Road West, and I just wanna thank you for bringing this. I'm in full support of it. I find that having trees, especially along Mass Ave, will make it far more walkable for people to get to businesses, to encourage that business use. So I'm in support of it, thank you. Thank you. Please.

> Thank you, Madam Chair. Carl Wagner, Precinct 15 town meeting member and Edge Hill Road resident. I think this is laudable. However, it should be pointed out that in the 9-11 ARB meeting, the proposed amendment would get rid of all open space in the density overlay that's being looked at in Arlington. So it feels like this is like having a night out, smashing windows, and then going to confession for the next day with a priest. I'm sorry, thank you.

<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 38</summary>

> Thank you. Anyone else? All right, on that note, we will close public comments for the evening. And I will turn it back over to the board for any comments, further comments regarding Article J, starting with Gene.

<details><summary>	 Eugene Benson - 69</summary>

> I should have mentioned one thing. There's a similar requirement in the MBTA communities draft. So if that goes through and town meeting passes it, we need this too, because you can't have anything for MBTA communities that's stricter than you have in your underlying zoning. So we need this added so it meshes. And so if MBTA communities passes, we get much more tree canopy over the decades.

<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 9</summary>

> Thank you for the clarification, Gene. Steve, anything further?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 70</summary>

> So yeah, usually I'm, you know, usually take pretty seriously the, whenever we add requirements to new development that weren't applicable to others or to previous developments. In this case, I think it's, I think it's, you know, the long-term benefit warrants doing so. And as properties are redeveloped, including in residential neighborhoods, I hope to see this help to build up the town tree canopy over time. Thank you.

<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 169</summary>

> Ken? No. Thank you. Great. So with that, we will close. I keep forgetting to turn off my timer. With that, we will close. Perfect timing. We will close the warrant articles for the public hearing for warrant articles for fall 2023 special town meeting. As I mentioned before, on October 2nd, the redevelopment board will meet again to deliberate and vote on whether to recommend action or no action on each of the articles we heard this evening, as well as the MBTA communities act article. If you do have any additional comment for anyone who's not able to join us this evening or anyone who was here who wishes to send us any additional thoughts, please do so in writing. You can send them directly to me, to any member of the board, to director Claire Ricker, and we would be more than happy to address those. Any questions you might have or any comments? Before October 2nd. Before October 2nd, yes. Before October 2nd. Let's see.

<details><summary>Upcoming Meeting Schedule</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 82</summary>

> So with this, we will move to agenda item number three, which is the upcoming meeting schedule. And I'd love to go through what our current meetings are. We had also tentatively looked to add a meeting to the redevelopment board schedule on October 10th for the purpose of reviewing and voting to approve the ARB report to town meeting, which is something that needs to be prepared following our October 2nd meeting. So Claire, I will turn it over to you.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker and Rachel Zsembery - 484</summary>

> I know that you were looking to see whether or not that date of October 10th was something that looked to be feasible by you and your team. Fantastic, yeah, thank you. When we went over this, the meeting schedule over the summer, we had left open the schedule for ARB meetings in October, knowing that there was a special town meeting schedule. Currently, were we to stay on our regular every two weeks. If we met on the second, the next two opportunities would be on the 16th, and then again on the 23rd. The chair has suggested a meeting potentially on the 10th, which is out of, you know, sort of cycle, out of sequence to what we usually do. I think the 10th is a good timeline. It's one that the department can respond to. We should be able to have a draft report at that point for your review and approval. The 9th is a holiday. The 9th is a holiday. Right, the 9th is a holiday. It's Indigenous Peoples Day, so that's why we are proposing to meet on the 10th. Okay. So we would still need to post the agenda items for the meeting on the 10th, I believe on Thursday, the Thursday before, because of the fact that the 9th is a holiday and the town offices are closed. Okay. So that would mean we will vote on the second, and we will need to post the draft of the report on the 5th. All right, so is there... I'm fine with the 10th. You're fine with the 10th? Okay, is there... I think we need to officially vote on that. So is there a motion to schedule a meeting of the Redevelopment Board on October 10th? So motioned. Second. We'll take a vote, starting with Steve. Yes. Gene. Yes. Ken. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. So we will now add October 10th at 7.30 p.m. to our schedule. Here? Yes, that would be here. Thank you. And then we currently have a meeting on our calendar for the night of the 16th. I don't believe that we currently have anything scheduled for that meeting. So I believe that on the second, what I'd like to do is to make a call as to whether or not to eliminate that meeting. Town meeting does start the next night. And then we have a meeting, I think we had tentatively scheduled for the 23rd. We do have town meeting that evening. So if we do need to meet that evening, we could meet at 7 p.m. as we've done before. But again, I think let's see what we have leading up to that meeting, and then we can make the call as to whether or not to adjust that meeting date as we get closer to October. Fantastic. Great. At this time, I will see Steve.

<details><summary>	 Stephen Revilak - 40</summary>

> Just regarding the meeting on October 2nd. Yes. Would we want to, would it be worth considering having an earlier start time just because we have quite a bit to go through that night? Or are we comfortable with 7.30?
</details>
<details><summary>	 Claire Ricker - 54</summary>

> I'm just looking at the time there. I'm more comfortable with 7.30 just because I will be coming up from Norwood. Oh okay. And I have a tough time getting here with traffic. I'm assuming. I will make sure I am stocked up with coffee for the following morning. Sorry about that. No worries.
</details>
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 124</summary>

> Okay. It's all good. I will work with Claire too to see if we have anything else on the agenda for that evening. And we will look to make sure that the majority of the agenda is the deliberation and voting on the 10 articles. We will have also, we'll need to discuss the timing. There is a citizen article, zoning article, that needs to be noticed that I believe we're working together with town council to determine whether or not that can also occur on the 2nd or whether or not we need to hear that article on the 10th. So we will update the board on that as well. And I believe that that is everything related to our upcoming meeting schedule.
</details></details>
<details><summary>Adjourn</summary> 
<details><summary>	 Rachel Zsembery - 219</summary>

> So with that, is there a motion to adjourn? Oh sorry. So on the 10th we're going to be reviewing the report. Correct. So the report's going to have to include our recommendation on the citizen warrant article. Unless we, right. So we're going to have to discuss it on the 2nd. We are going to try to hold that hearing on the on the 2nd. And again, we need to look at the timing for that. If that does not occur, I have spoken with the moderator and he is willing to accept a report to town meeting and then an amended report to town meeting that includes that article, which will occur after, as is typical, after all of the other zoning articles. So it would be later in town. Can we get comments on the citizen trial? I have not received it myself, so as soon as we receive it, we will distribute it to the board. Any other questions related to schedule? Okay, that closes agenda item number three. And I will see if there is a motion for agenda item number four, which is to adjourn. So motioned. Second. Second. Take a vote starting with Steve. Yes. Jean. Yes. Ken. Yes. And I'm a yes as well. This meeting is adjourned. Thank you all.
