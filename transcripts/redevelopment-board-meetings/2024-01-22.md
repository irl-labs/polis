<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7:30pm The Board will review and vote to approve meeting minutes. </blockquote>

Good evening everyone and welcome to the January 22nd meeting of the Town of Arlington Redevelopment Board. I'd like to call this meeting to order. My name is Rachel Zenberry. I'm the chair of the board and I'd like to ask the other members of the board to please introduce themselves, starting with Steve. Steve Revellat. Good evening. Eugene Benson. Shaina Corman-Houston. Ken Lau. And this evening we also have joining us the director of the Department of Planning and Community Development, Claire Ricker, and the assistant director, Sarah Suarez. So thank you very much. I appreciate you all joining us this evening. The first item on our agenda is the review of the meeting minutes from December 18, 2023. Are there any additions or corrections, starting with Ken? Is this the one that's in this one here, 18? Yes. The 10-page one? Yes, I do have one. I had it and I moved it. Shall I put it there? Don't worry. Should I just come back? Yeah. Okay. Great. Sina, any additions or corrections? I have none. Gene? I have none. Steve? Nothing here. I have one. I'll give you another couple minutes. So on page 9, the last sentence of the second paragraph, where it talks about what the board and the building inspector had approved, I only mentioned the board because I did not comment on the approval. We don't have knowledge of the building inspector. So if you could cross that out, that would be great. That's all I have. The one I had was about having them bring something back for our approval, not to explain our responsibility. Is that also related to the same project, 882 Mass Ave.? Yes. I can't seem to find that. I had it there a minute ago. Is that also at the top of page 9? Is it this paragraph here? The last sentence? Nope. Okay. You also mentioned right there. Yes. I would like the board to come back at the next board meeting to explain what the developer is going to do, not explain our responsibility or our requirements. So flip it, I guess. So the developer could explain their response to achieving compliance with the board's decision or with the special permit conditions. Yeah. I don't think we want to explain our requirements, so we already did. Okay. That's all I had. Great. Thank you. Any other additions or corrections? Is there a motion to approve the minutes as amended? So motioned. Second. We'll take a vote starting with Steve. Yes. Jean? Yes. Shana? Yes. Ken? Yes. And I'm a yes as well. The meeting minutes have been approved for December 18th, 2023.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 7:40 pm The Board will hear and discuss potential citizen petition warrant articles proposed by Town residents.  All right. We'll now move to agenda item number two, citizen warrant articles, and I will turn it over to Claire to introduce anyone we have joining us this evening.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Claire Ricker - 74</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Great. Thank you. So we have two citizen petition articles looking for feedback from the board before the close of the warrant later this week. We'll start with, let's see, we can start with Three Family Everywhere by J.P. Lewick and Annie LaPorte, and then we'll move on to Andy Green's article about rear yard setbacks in the business districts. So. Great. If you'd like to present your article, that would be great.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Paul LeGuy and Annie LaCourt - 1064</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sure. This is my first time here. Okay. Wonderful. So what I could ask you to do is just to come up to the front here so that we have a fighting chance of the microphone picking up your voice. You could just sit. That's totally fine. Yep. And then I'll get a thumbs up from you once he starts speaking as to whether or not we're able to pick you up. And if you could just please each state your name and address for the record, and we'd love to hear your thoughts on your proposed warrant article. Thank you. So John Paul LeGuy, 104 Bay State Road in Precinct 2. Annie LaPorte, 48 Chatham Street, Precinct 13. Great. Yep. So you're more than welcome to have the floor if you, you know, can have up to five minutes or so. And if you have more than that, just let us know to explain. It looks like you have a presentation to take us through. We do. Perfect. Thank you very much. So yes, during the MBTA communities process last year, there was a great deal of discussion about the best ways of bringing more multifamily housing to Oglington. One of the suggestions that didn't make it into the final proposal, but that I thought was quite interesting and should be considered, is to look at making three-family dwellings by right, an option that's more available throughout the town. So there is a little bit of uncertainty. We're in touch with town council about whether allowing both two and three-family dwellings would qualify for the like 50% voting threshold language. So yeah, we'll be in touch with them. So it could be two and three-family dwellings by right throughout Oglington, or it might be just three-family dwellings. So in terms of how we're, yeah, so our goals for this are to address the regional and local housing shortage that I'm sure you're all quite familiar with, but also in doing this, doing so to kind of not disrupt the neighborhood character, to do that by keeping existing dimensional requirements in place. So no change in setbacks, height limits, floor limits. So essentially, buildings of the same size are currently permitted, could be constructed, but just with more dwelling units within them. So we have our planned one-artic language here. I think Annie had reached out to town council about that as well. I reached out to town council. I have not got a final determination back from him. I have a lot of signatures on trust at the moment, but I will be sure that the language is adequate for us to have a broad scope and a good discussion before I finalize it and take it into the Selected's office. Sorry, I know I'm not talking loud enough. No, you're funny. Look. All right. But yeah, so this is what we have. So in terms of specific bylaw changes, we'd be amending a few things with the R0, R1, and R2 districts. So again, the second bullet point, a little bit up in the air, depending on what we hear back from town council, we will certainly be adding three-family dwellings as a yes in the table in 5.4.3. Depending on what we hear back at the office, I don't know if it would be the case that we'd be adding yes for two-family dwellings slash duplex for R0 and R1, but more to come on that. Actually, if you just back up a little bit more. So yeah, there are also a few points there where when you look at the definition of the districts in 5.4.1.a, it's like, oh, it's the single-family residential district or the large lot single-family. And it doesn't really make sense to kind of, if we're changing this fashion, it didn't feel like it made sense to kind of keep it with the no longer applicable definition. So we'd just be changing that to remove the single-family or two-family aspect from it. And then I think, yeah, same for 5.4.2.a, there's a few things in the table that would be kind of similar to what John said. We don't have a full draft of the changes yet. I'm going to take everyone on the town council for the two versus three question. Yeah, I think a few people just had a good mind. But yeah, we did actually, we did also have a few things that we value your feedback on very much. A large part of it is that we want to leave the zoning bylaw, kind of been a good place after all of this to kind of not have corner cases or unforeseen situations. That would be, that would apply. So definitely, if you think of anything or you see anything, we'd love to hear it. There were a few places that we weren't really sure exactly the best way to handle it yet. So the first point, it felt a little silly that you to kind of have the, in the R3 district, have that remain with a special permit when we're allowing by right in R0 through R2. I could see a case though that, I mean, since they have different dimensional requirements, that there's definitely a case for keeping the special permit process in that, in those situations, three floors, they've got smaller setbacks. So yeah, we're kind of, we're already going, I mean, also, I think there are probably very few R3 lots that aren't currently three family for that matter. So open to kind of any thoughts or feedback on that. And then also how to handle existing accessory dwelling units. It's my understanding that those are only permissible in R0 through R2 right now. The R3 doesn't qualify. And I mean, I can certainly see a case, you don't want a situation where someone, they go and they build an ADU right now, and then they're back here in six months or a year to convert to a three. But on the other hand, it's about someone who built an ADU five years ago or 10 years ago. So yeah, we're kind of curious about what you, yeah, how you think that should be best handled. And just anywhere else in the zoning bylaw that seems important to change or important to keep consistent with this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. Thank you so much. All right. Let's go ahead and, Annie, did you have anything that you would like to add to this? I think we covered it. Okay. I'm just going to keep up my reputation as a mom. Fabulous. All right. Let's go ahead and start with Steve for discussion and questions from the members of the board.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 278</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So just a couple of things to clarify. So here, when you say not changing the dimensional regulations, so R0 would still have a 9,000 square foot lot size and R1 would have a 6,000 square feet. And you would plan to keep the two and a half story height limit? We will. Okay. And so regarding your open questions, as far as R3 goes, the warrant language doesn't mention it. So I don't think, I think it would need different language to do that. Now, R3 through 7 comprises a very small land area, a very small part of land area. It would be nice to make it consistent, but, you know, R3 is basically where triple deckers existed in the 70s. That became R3. And as far as ADUs go, ADUs are allowed in all business and industrial, business and residential districts in conjunction with a single or two family dwelling. So I think the only, you know, sort of corner case that you might run into there is if someone had a two family dwelling and converted, say, a garage to a detached ADU. ADUs aren't permitted in conjunction with a three family dwelling. They'd kind of be stuck in that configuration. They wouldn't be able to go to a three family without discontinuing the ADUs. But otherwise, if it were, you know, some, there wouldn't, otherwise, I don't see any points of potential interference. If someone had a two family and wanted to, it's another option that they could opt for. Does it sound like we need to disturb that? I don't think so. Anything else, Steve? That's all I have for now.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 209</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, Gene. Yeah, just a couple of additional points in addition to what Steve had to say. I think the last time through town meeting, we said no single or two family homes in the business districts. So at the beginning, you said this was everywhere in town. Later on, you're saying it's just R1, R0, and R2. So which ones are you proposing? I think everywhere would say a literary flourish. And that the technical bylaw would be R1, R2, R0, R1, and R2. Because we weren't thinking of changing the business districts for, when I looked at the other residential districts, it didn't kind of make sense to me to make big changes to those. So it didn't make sense to me for places where we already have big multifamily development and it's allowed to then suddenly add three family as part of that when... It's allowed already. Yeah. So why make the change? You know, I think that's a good point, though. That, I mean, if you have a single or two family allowed in those business districts, it definitely would have been a good case to include those as well. Three families are allowed in the business districts. Oh, okay. With a special permit.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 269</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gotcha. So it's all to keep in this existing special permit situation that Steve was talking about. So I spoke with one of my constituents about this. It just happened to come up after I saw what you were proposing, who had some concerns about it, but said the biggest concern was they'd look like two and three family homes and not like the single family homes in the neighborhood, and that was their biggest concern. And I think considering that we're requiring site plan review in the MBTA districts, I would have a hard time agreeing to these without site plan review to give us an opportunity to say that doesn't fit in. You know, you can build a three, but not one that looks like a three family home in the same family neighborhood. If you go through my neighborhood, there are a couple of twos that sort of stand out, but there are also a lot of twos that could be single family homes if you didn't understand that they were two family homes. So I'd be interested in thinking about site plan review for these, also because we are doing site plan review of the whole MBTA community district anyhow, where people can build three family homes in the neighborhood, or more for site plan review. So I'd like you to think about whether it makes sense to do site plan review as opposed to no review. To me, it would make sense to include the R3 district in site plan review and get rid of the special permit, just so there's consistency with those.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I ask a question? So what are the bureaucratic steps that we're going to have to jump through for a site plan?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 396</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're going to be talking about the potential of that later this evening. Stay tuned. Great. Yeah, I mean... So just think about... I think the short answer, as I see it, is the big difference is they're as of right, but they need to at least go through the board to make sure the board's comfortable with what they're doing, to make sure that they're meeting all the zoning requirements, and that we can look at things like landscaping, where the cars are, and things of that nature. Yeah, I mean, I guess I would say... Just think about that as an option. The other thing, and I don't know what to do about this personally, we just got MBTA communities passed, and I think, as you correctly noted, one idea was let's do this everywhere, but that's not the... idea that got adopted by the committee and that's not the idea that we approved and that's not the idea that town meeting approved so I just wonder whether this is too soon not giving MBTA communities at least a couple of years if not more to see how that plays out and then if we're not getting any buildings I think you have a much better case to make that this would be an important next step so I just like that's one of my big hesitancies about doing this just the other one is getting an idea about if this were to go into place over the next five years what could we expect in terms of changes we had that come up in MBTA communities and Steve did some work to try to figure out a potential answer I think we would have to get an idea about how big a change or how small a change is this if this were to go in place right the R0 R1 and R2 because I mean I see right now you know buildings in my neighborhood getting bought torn down and larger ones getting built in their place I don't have any idea whether if this were to be in place they would be two or three family rather than one family or whether more would get turned over torn down I think it would be really helpful to know that in terms of deciding what we would want to do about this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you Steve. All very good points. I mean, I think we're definitely open to site plan review, we'll be thinking about it, I mean it seems like a very good balance of trade-offs between kind of having an extensive process, it takes a really long time, but with site plan review, that's a possibility, that's a, you know, And I think, you know, we have guidance for single and two family homes now. I think we would need to figure out whether we could extend that to three family homes so that there's at least some guidance about, you know, the door should face the street and not the backyard, things of that nature. One question. Just in order, do you think the existing warrant article language would be extensive enough to allow us to add site plan review to it? Because we've got just so many definitions, expanding uses. Good question to ask the Town Council. Okay, yes, thank you. It's pretty generic. I mean, it doesn't even really say by right, so it doesn't exclude talking about site plan review. I'd ask the Town Council. All right. Thank you. Great.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gina. So, I also would be really interested to hear an analysis of potential development and anticipated or suspected development capacity here. I suspect, my supposition is that rather than new development, rather than teardowns, we're more likely to see conversions of two family homes into three family homes or one family homes into three family homes. In instances such as those, I wonder what does that mean for site plan review? And, you know, do you get site plan review if you, do you have the opportunity for site plan review if you are not changing the envelope of the building? Another question that arises is parking, if you're not changing the envelope of the building but increasing the number of units. One of the concerns that came up frequently was the actual or appearance of parking in the front yard and front yard setbacks and driveways that were so wide that it looked like. So, some thought about the ability to park on site would also be, I think, useful.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initially planned to just keep it with the existing one space per unit. And, I think there's like a 20 foot wide driveway at the start up to a certain depth. We're planning to keep it at that. But, we're planning to work with that. And, in terms of, you know, maybe it's like if you're going to have to change the parking for it, maybe that's a good site plan review opportunity or something else.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, great. Great. Ken? I echo the same comments as some of my board members have stated already. I just want to take on a different aspect of it. And, you're saying simply you want to make it by right so we can get three families in the same shape as a single family in the same lot size. Okay. So, you're advocating for smaller units then. Because you're fitting three units in a unit that would be a single family. So, it would be a much smaller living. And, have you guys done any studies on that? You know, I'm not asking you to draw the whole thing up. I just want to have an understanding. Thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Paul LeGuy and Annie LaCourt - 124</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a single family house that was at 12,000 square feet. In this 5,000 square foot lot size. R1. Excuse me. Now, you convert that to a three family. Now, what's that bring? To 650 or 800 square foot units? Because now you're, you know, jamming all this stuff in there. So, I think about it two ways. And, probably I'm influenced by the fact that I live in what's now Precinct 13. So, to go back to the infamous house across the street from me that drives me nuts. It's 5,000 square feet on a 6,000 square foot lot. And, would easily accommodate three units. If you think about it. 5,000 divided by three is 1,700 square feet. No, which is fine.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Kin Lau - 87</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, that's not my question. What's the question? My question to you says, you are not going to increase the size of the setbacks, requirements, and everything else. So, that gives your house a certain size. Yep. Alright. From that certain size, you originally set a single family house in there. Yep. Now, you're putting a three family house in there. So, it normally means that each one of those units are going to be smaller. Yep. So, what is that size? Have you looked at it?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 John Paul LeGuy and Annie LaCourt and Kin Lau - 955</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll be putting three families in there that are 6,000 square feet or 1,000 square feet. I'm not asking you to look at some weird thing off to the side somewhere. But, we have a bunch of land. Yep. Our one that's like 5,000 square feet. Everywhere. We have... An average case. Yes. Two and a half story height of the building. So, what happens when you put three families in there? What are the size of those three families? So... Let me keep on going. I'm pretty sure you haven't done that yet. No, we haven't. But, these are just questions I wanted to bring up. And, I want you guys to think about it. Okay. I'm not asking for answers right now. Because, it's not fair. Okay. When you go from a two family to a three family, I think you need two means of egress. So, there's now two sets of stairs in your building unless it's a new building that is sprinkler. Then, you're allowed to use one set of egress stairs. Okay. So, now you're sprinkler in buildings that are not sprinkler before or you're taking up more space for a second set of stairs. Have you thought about how that changes your parameters of what you come up here? And then, you get to a point where if you look at one unit, to build that within that space there, what's the cost per square foot for that unit? Are we aiming toward affordable units, market rate units, or high-end units? You know, I mean these like New York condos somewhere out, you know, and we're putting in there the small compact units that are really ritzy because they can afford to pay extra money for all that. Or are we trying to make it affordable where it's down, you know, not down there, but you know what I'm saying, that's going to be economically built. I just want you to think about that stuff, how when, because there's other ramifications when you change what you just said, putting a three-family as a right into a one single-family shell. Okay? And then something else, Jean, I thought Jean was going to talk about it, is if this goes to town meeting, Jean, if you might say that. You go right ahead. When it's multi-family, okay, I think the law says all you need is a simple majority to pass the zoning ordinance. Yes. Now, if it's two-family, you don't. You need a... Two-thirds. Yes. So there's a big difference how you formulate this thing here. Yep. What they ask is what the approval is. Yes. We're very aware, and it's still very unclear. I'm just bringing it up. Exactly. I'm not trying to... No, no, I'm with you. I think it comes down to what will we put in the recommended vote and will that be something that we get a ruling that it can be a simple majority or not. And so there is a possibility of foundering on the rocks there because we just don't know. Yep. Okay. What is allowable under the, was it housing choice law, with regard to sort of up to three units versus three units. Does that make sense? Go back to what I said earlier. I think if you guys have enough time, enough energy to think about that, it actually comes out with different configurations and what are else's. And get... So the public has an understanding of what it would be like. You can say, oh, it's still within the... It's going to be different. It's going to be three doors, the parking, storage. Are you going to have... It's going to be a whole bunch of questions there that we should at least think about and have some sort of response for, that's all. I'm not asking for it now. I'm just breaking things up that I'm thinking of when I hear this. And I just want it to be somewhat thought about and addressed. No, those are very good points. I mean, we're definitely hoping to kind of have that ready. I think the plaintiffs have actually prepared quite a fair bit of... Because I think that throughout the amputation process, there were so many concerns of different types raised. So I'm hoping and planning to have a lot written to respond to kind of all those different areas and how we think it would fit into that. And I mean, especially I think it would be very helpful, like you mentioned, to have, here's how we think the redevelopment of single family into this could play out in practice. Yeah, I mean, if it's simply taken a big single family house and just renovate all the insides of it, it's simple. It's outside, so it looks the same. But if you're building a new three-family, how's that going to look? And how's that going to take shape and form, and what's that going to become? And that's two things I think I'd be looking for. I think my example, I used to live in a two-family in East Arlington, and I kind of go back to that as one of my examples. It was kind of a three-bed unit above, and then the standard two-family, or sorry, two-bedroom on the first floor. But I had a fairly large basement. Maybe the kind of three-family configuration of that is to take the existing common areas of both basements and you put in kind of a single-bedroom studio type thing in the basement with the egress and whatnot. But like I said, that's just kind of my impression. I think there's a lot more to actually look at.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any other questions? I have a couple. Just one last one. Be careful how you when you lay this stuff out, and if you put three one-bedrooms in this one area, or you could put three bedrooms, there's a big difference. It has to do with families. Now you're changing the population here from a younger population to a population that may have families. So if you build a whole bunch of these, now it's not a family-oriented town or something. I don't know. You've got to think about that kind of stuff. That's all I'm saying. I think we would love to keep the existing R3, some elements of that. If we thought it would potentially ever pass, we would be very interested in the actual full three stories instead of the two-and-a-half floors, stuff like that. But it doesn't seem like it would, so we're kind of looking at it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Great. I just have two additional questions. I think you've already had some really great questions in Food for Thought offered to you by my other board members here. I just want to make sure that I understand your intent. So if Town Council comes back and says that proposing two-and-three family dwellings by right would not meet the requirements of the housing choice, would your intent be to have an article that solely dealt with three families so that you could take advantage of the housing choice simple majority, or would you go with the two and continue with the two-and-three and move forward with the super majority? I think...</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know what my perspective is. My perspective is that if we can craft an article that would allow for more, again, a greater variety of housing types and housing choice in Arlington that we could have available under the housing choice law, and we had a 50% vote at town meeting, that we have a possibility of making that happen. If it's a two-thirds vote, then it feels like a big fight for us to lose, which is what our experience was with the two families. We came close to a simple majority, but we did not come close to two-thirds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I think the Overton window is shifting, okay? But apropos of Gene's argument, it's coming really fast on top of MBT and communities, and I'm not sure that that fight will be a good one to turn to. So my feeling is I would have to decide that either it makes sense from a zoning perspective to proceed with three-family, and I would expect all of you to advise us on that, okay, because we're not the zoning experts here, or to say, no, we'll fight this battle another day. As Gene says, after we see what MBTA and communities does for us in terms of three-family configurations in those zones, and how do people feel about them, and then you might have a better opportunity to spread the love throughout the town. That certainly answers my question, and I think what I wanted to offer back, that was my understanding, I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't misunderstanding, is that I think the proposition of allowing for two and three-family homes in the R0, R1, and 2 districts is one thing that I think we would consider in one vein, skipping over the two-family, and just going to the three-family, and again, I'll just speak for myself, not for my other board members, just to take advantage of the supermajority, to me, feels disingenuous to what, you know, again, it was intended for. I think that to me, it would be one conversation, you know, if they're both allowed, you know, per town council, that's one thing, and we'll discuss that if it winds up being just the three-family, and we, again, have one and three, and we have to remain silent on two, because we're trying to get something through in a specific type of vote, I don't know that that's something that I personally would feel comfortable supporting. So I just want to share my perspective with you up front. So again, I'm just kind of looking at the continuity of the language, and what we have to offer. If it, either, however way it turns out, I think precinct meetings, and speaking with people in these neighborhoods is something that's going to be really, really important. I think that that was really hopeful when we saw how many people who supported all sides and angles of the debate around MBTA communities came out. And I think that you're going to have a lot of interest in this if it moves forward. And the more types of people that you're able to bring to the table, the better. So I would just say that it's, again, knowing how much time and effort we put into, as a town, bringing people together to debate this, to make sure that we could come up with something that the town aligned on. I would hate to, I want to make sure that that same goodwill is echoed here. And I know that you both believe in that as well. I just wanted to make sure that that's clear for everyone that this would require a public process.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we're definitely committed to doing kind of whatever we can to provide for a piece of public input on it. I'm very willing to be kind of, I don't know what the venues for that are, in terms of whether you'd like to have potential development board meetings or special sessions or, I don't know, yeah. Kind of what, you know, under whose auspices or how you think that could be done. We're glad to try to organize that privately if you think that would be helpful. I mean, I think, and again, I'll turn it over to Jean and Steve, both who raised their hands to discuss. The challenge with it being, again, a citizen petition is that, you know, the planning department and the redevelopment board can advise and support, but a lot of this falls to you as opposed to the board. And so, again, I just want to make sure that you're, that that's something that you're keeping top of mind, too. Thank you. Okay. Very much appreciated. Absolutely.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean. I have a couple of additional thoughts. One was, which will get assessed at a higher value, a 6,000 square foot single family home or a building with three 2,000 square foot units? I think it would be really helpful for you to talk to the assessor and get us some answers about what are the tax implications of doing this because you would expect more people in a three unit building than a one unit building. Theoretically, maybe more kids, maybe not. So I think it would be helpful to understand if the town's gonna have some of those extra expenses, is are they offset, at least in part, by the additional tax revenues that would come in? So I'd be really interested in knowing what that would be like.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can talk to Dana and Alex, but I think there's also, we do have some ways of looking at data along those lines. We probably know what the difference is between X square foot of two family or three family now and what the assessment is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might want to actually talk to someone in the Board of Assessors to get an idea about how they would do the analysis for something like this in the R0 or R1 or R2 zones. So we get an idea about comparing a new single family versus this or old single family that's converted into a two or three, as Shana suggested, and what would it do for tax revenues for the town. I'd be very interested in understanding that. And I'm sort of leaning where Rachel is on, if there are no two families in the Ward article, it seems a little wrong to allow ones and threes in the R1 and R2, but not twos in the R2. And you know, the old, old theory of Euclidean zoning was in like the single family, you gotta have single families. In two families, you gotta have singles and twos. In the three families, you have ones and twos and threes. So this would be not necessarily illegal, but very odd to say there's a district where you can have one family and three family, but not two family homes. That makes sense. I mean, I think it kind of boggled all of our minds when we started hearing stuff that like the housing choice wouldn't let you, like, I don't, I mean, I don't think, even if it doesn't allow it, I can't imagine a legislature's intent that they'd have a situation where a town wants to have two and three and it wouldn't apply, but yeah, so no, we definitely get that. It is a little weird.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, and I believe we have another citizen ward article discussion this evening. So welcome. And we have Andy Greenspan joining us this evening, so if you could just introduce yourself, first and last name and address for the record, and then if you would like to take us through the presentation you have prepared, that would be fantastic.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Andy Greenspon - 810</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Andy Greenspan, 89 Palmer Street, precinct five. This is about rear setbacks in the business district. You may notice it's nearly identical proposed warrant language from one in special town meeting, because it's something I noticed as we were debating language that was approved for special town meeting. Next. So if I'm wrong about my interpretation of the existing language, please let me know after this. But my interpretation of the existing language was that when you go for a business district parcel that abuts a residential in the rear, if you go from a three story building to a four story building, based on my reading of the existing language, the entire setback of the entire building has to go from 20 feet to 30 feet. And so this proposed language would change that so that for such a building, it would be 20 feet for the first three stories and then above that 30 feet just for the fourth and higher stories. And I'm open to tweaking this language in a way that makes the most syntactical sense, but this is just what I thought of. Next. So my understanding under current zoning is if you had a three story business district building and on the left is a two and a half story residential building, at the lot line you would need 20 feet rear setback, but if you wanted a four story building, the entire thing would have to be pushed back. Next. And I believe my language would make this the results if it was adopted, which is just the fourth and higher story would be 30 foot back. Next. So my reasoning when I was thinking about this is if you have to decrease or increase the setback for every other story to add a fourth story in a business district, it seems like it would decrease the economic feasibility of construction, especially since a lot of Arlington's lots are small. So it may end up actually capping like what would be built with the current setback. So this is an example I have based on an estimate of what I think are some realistic lot sizes based on my own two family and walking around, which is if you had a building that was 100 feet wide and the depth of the building is 60 feet because you need a 20 foot setback if there's a residential behind you, ignoring stairwells and everything, it would be 6,000 square feet per floor, you'd get 18,000 square feet. If you wanted a fourth floor, you'd have to decrease the setback or increase the setback of every story so that you'd only be able to actually add 2,000 square feet in the construction of adding a fourth floor. And with the proposed amendment, you'd get an extra 3,000 square feet relative status quo. So it'd be fairly similar. You'd actually get the economic, in my view, economic viability of adding the third, fourth story. Next. So given Arlington's small parcel sizes, I haven't talked to anyone. I'm not, this is sort of for you all, I'm not a builder, but given the shrinking of floor plate, the depth of floor plate, if you had to add that fourth story, I am worried that with the existing language, there may be sort of a default financial cap of actually adding a fourth or fifth story in areas where that height limit is already allowed, but it may de facto financially be really three stories, which would defeat the purpose of existing use story limits in other parts of the business plan. Next. And I was trying to look at adjacent communities. Somerville overhauled their zoning code a little recently, so it makes it very easy for me to find the comparison, and this is what I thought of when we were discussing this at town meeting, which is they do sort of essentially the same thing. Mid-rise is close in Somerville to business district or mixed use, and they have four, five, or six story districts, but regardless of the max height, for neighborhood residential, it's the same as Arlington residential effectively. For the first to third story, but in residential, it's 20 feet, and then for every story above, it's 30 feet, so that was the closest comparison I could find. Next. I did try to find Medford, Walden, Lexington, Belmont. Their zoning codes are much harder to read through, so I couldn't find an exact comparison, and a lot of them seem to still use the old L plus H over 10 or six that we purposely simplified for, so it's hard to make an apples to apples comparison, but if anyone knows, I'm happy to sort of hear. I think that's it, so I'm happy to hear your thoughts. Thank you very much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excuse me. Bless you. We'll start with Ken. Thank you. I agree with you. What you got here is fine. I think it does not make sense if you go another story to push the whole building back. We're trying to encourage business and I think this is a good thing, and you're not adding any more additional shadow to your neighbors while encouraging business. I think this is a win-win. You are somewhat correct. When you do the four story, you have to evaluate the extra elevator stop and the two extra stair risers to the top. What's that gonna, that premium you got to pay for, is it worth that square footage? Most of the time in the shallow site plans we have along Mass Ave, some of the areas is not. It just doesn't make sense to add another floor because you're adding all that extra to it, but where it becomes bigger place, it does make sense. This might not apply everywhere, but I think it's a good thing. I think we should modify it. I agree with you. Yes, I support this wholeheartedly. Great, thank you. I am supportive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shana? I am also supportive. I was looking for the language in the bylaw about front step backs. I wonder if you end up getting the top floor squeezed above three stories and having it be a further economic burden. I think it, in the end, doesn't actually matter that much. You lose the square footage with the loss of backyard, rear yard space or the increased rear yard space or the squeezed setback, but I do wonder about that. However, one way or another, I'm supportive. I think it's a very thoughtful solution. Great, thank you.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 192</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene? I guess two thoughts. One is, we would probably also need to change a definition of setback. So, I hadn't looked at this before, Andy, but I think we need to take a look at not simply changing what you're doing there, but take a look at the definitions and some other things to see if we need to do something with those too so we don't end up with some conflicting language from one part of the zoning bylaw to another. The second is, right now, all of the buildings you mentioned are gonna have to come to the redevelopment board for an environmental design review, and environmental design review, we are allowed to change the required setbacks already. So, I don't know if this is absolutely necessary to do, but it's worth thinking about. But I'm more concerned that if you're gonna propose that one change to that one section, that we need to look through the rest of the zoning bylaw and maybe adjust. I'm not sure, I haven't looked at some of the other things, so we don't end up with unusual wording. Great, thank you, Gene.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve? I'm also supportive. In my lunchtime ritual of reading other community zoning amendments, I'm working on one that, they don't do front yard setbacks, it's all rear yard, which I thought was, I'm sort of warming up to the idea in terms of as a way to, if you're in front of a building, you have the street to provide some separation, but you don't necessarily get so much of that on a rear yard, and the stepbacks provide a way, on the back of the building provide a way for light to get in. But I do take your point about the point about, by not requiring the whole rear facade to come in, you are preserving more space on the ground floor, and I think that's a good thing.</blockquote>

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson and Andrew Greenspon - 426</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I respond? Absolutely. One other question. Some of the buildings are gonna be taller than four stories, so what do you do to at least step back? I mean, as far as I know, it still wouldn't, this change wouldn't affect the shadows because the three stories, like if you add those, like shrinking the first to third story won't affect the. No, no, wait a second. It's for fourth and higher. So it would stay at 30. So fourth and higher, if you just. Would still be the 30 foot, which I think is the case in the existing language, yeah, it says fourth or higher. So I have a quick response to another question regarding the special, I think you said environmental review. I understand you can sort of, I guess, I don't know what the rule is. You're allowed to decrease the rear setback based on certain parameters. I still think it's good to have a sensible, like baseline of the rear setback because if someone trying to build may not even consider doing the fourth story, if there's a risk, like it'll be denied and it's not even financially feasible. So I think knowing that at that rear yard setback, they have something that's financially feasible and then environmental review, maybe it will, you all might choose to make it less, but there's a baseline that is financially feasible, sort of my thought. Regarding setback and step back, I know both are used in the zoning and I'm not sure how consistent it is because I could have written this as like a setback, right, instead, technically, like the top stories have a setback. Step back. Step back. Step back. Wait, which one's the current one in the whole? Setback is on the, think of setback as the ground floor. Yeah. Step back is somewhere. So I could have said like for those stories have a 10 foot step back, right, and it would have done the same thing. Yeah, as I said, syntactically, I don't have a strong opinion. I just want to know what makes the most sense and I'm happy to take whatever language you all or town council suggests. Yeah, I can, maybe you can talk later because I'm not sure where else we would do it. We should talk later I think it runs into a problem with the definition of setback. So we may want to call this a step back. So we should just figure out what to do about it. Yeah, that's fine.</blockquote>

The language I think is essentially the same as from the spec, you can send the same, have the same article again, right? Broad article as well and do something else, right? Like I think I'm pretty sure I took this exactly from the one in special town meeting to ensure it would allow step backward. Yeah, setback or step back. Just to give you latitude. Yeah.

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 9:00pm The Board will discuss their timeline for hearings on Warrant Articles to be presented to Annual Town Meeting. </blockquote>

All right let's move to the agenda item number four which is the warrant article hearing schedules. So we I went back and we took a look at our meeting schedule and the close of the warrant to sort of flush out and forecast what sort of what meetings we would need to bring these warrant articles to town meeting. And so this is a proposed schedule. We think that we can hold the ARB the regular meetings in February on the 5th and the 26th with the relative notice. We can do hearing number one to do the ARB and ZBA articles on the night of the 26th. The fourth which is another regular ARB meeting would be hearing number two to do any citizen petition articles. We could hold the 11th potentially for a continued hearing of one or two if necessary. But we did think a lot about the affordable housing overlay and if that is advanced what we may need for a hearing related to that you know article. So we held the 18th. We are considering reserving town hall for that warrant article. We think that there if we are going to be sending a mailing to all 20,000 addresses in Arlington for a town-wide overlay we should likely probably best best for us to hold that hearing in a larger venue. We would have a regular meeting on 4-1 to deliberate vote. The draft report to town meeting will be drafted and posted on the 4th and then the meeting on the 8th we would do any revisions and vote to approve the ARB report to town meeting as revised. I don't know how folks feel about this schedule or about the idea that we would hold affordable housing overlay hearing in a larger venue. Any other comments or discussion?

We would need to or I guess it's more of a comment than anything else we would need to as a board have a really fruitful discussion on the meeting on the 5th regarding the reduced height buffer area so that we have the language ready to go for that which I don't think is a problem and we would also need to make sure and I think that they were really well down the path with regard to creating their materials to make sure that the Conservation Commission with their you know would have their materials ready for the inland wetland district piece for that meeting. I'm still really concerned about the affordable housing overlay going to 2024 special town meeting if they decide to push forward with it that's fine I just don't think that there's been nearly enough public process but that's my point of view. This is a great job what you got here. I'm a little concerned that we're shutting down development here for two and a half months. Are there room where we fit in other projects that may come up for our review? I don't want to say hey you know someone has bought a project and want to develop something we're saying you can't present it until summer or till early late summer you know so we can sort of leave slots open I'm not saying there is any you probably know better than I do this not right now. Even when we did MBTA communities we would start with any new development and then move into the warrant article hearings. I think that happened on a couple of the non MBTA community so for example I don't think hearing number one is going to take long at all. No I'm not worried about one I'm worried about further down the line I'm worried I'm worried about early March and late. Yeah I think if we have two nights though for the citizen petition articles outside of the affordable housing overlay that I think we should be able you know based on what we've heard. Should we just put a slash saying any projects that may come up?</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Just so we would notice so just I just want to make sure that we don't leave all that behind. This is very important but I want to make sure we have enough slots available if any projects come up for a review. Sure we will prioritize that in addition to you know any of these hearings. And especially did we get anything back from the one we talked about last project? We did get an updated rendering back. I think that's on our agenda under new business. Okay then I'll just keep on going. Just temporarily. Okay. Jayna. Looks great.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene. Yeah I think it looks good the in addition to what Ken mentioned about recognizing that who knows and maybe some special permit issues coming in. I just wonder whether this proposal we heard about tonight to allow two and threes in the R0 ones and twos will have a lot of people come out and whether we need town hall for that also. I just don't know but I think it is the other one that could bring out a lot of people. The question to what Claire was just putting in is I was thinking the exact same thing is do we do both of those on the same night? We could restrict the timing on both of those. Give them each 90 minutes. Yeah so that yeah that's my only comment otherwise I think that's a good way to go. Actually I just mentioned we asked when David Morgan and Chuck Tarone were here on the inland wetland we asked for some information from them which we have not received. Understood. I will follow up with Chuck and David. Great. Thank you.</blockquote>

<summary><a href="https://arlington.novusagenda.com/agendapublic/CoverSheet.aspx?ItemID=17270&MeetingID=1995 "</a>5. Review of Draft Changes to Rules and Regulations</summary> 
<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 21</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 9:15pm The Board will review the proposed changes to the Board Rules and Regulations regarding Site Plan Review. </blockquote>

All right so let's move to our next agenda item which is the proposed changes to the board rules and regulations for a site plan review. So I circulated and Jean was thoughtful enough to draft for us change to rule 20 in the ARB rules and regulations. Tonight is just a discussion of the draft. We do have to advertise and hold a hearing for specific rule changes to the to the regs but I thought we could kick off the conversation or at least continue our conversation that we started at the board retreat in December with this draft. If I can just say a few things how it got to this point. This is an amalgam and a synthesis of the draft that Claire sent to us a while ago along with handbook from I think it was CTPC on site plan review I literally borrowed pieces of that for this plus pieces that currently exist in the rules and regulations so and a little bit from chapter 48 of the general laws so it was my attempt in a first draft to put all of those together a couple things I think we can think about as we go through them as Claire had suggested in her draft a site plan review pre-application meeting would be required I am wondering whether it should be optional for very small projects let's say four and fewer units on the side streets and mandatory for everything else or if it should be mandatory for everything that's one sort of big questions about this second in the first draft people couldn't file their application until they got approval of their affordable housing proposal which didn't make sense to me because I don't think it can stop somebody from filing an application so I flipped this around so that they would as part of the application would have to get a letter from either the department or the Affordable Housing Trust affordable housing proposal is satisfactory and and then most of the application timetable and review process is pretty much the same as the EDR process now so it was run on the same schedule as the EDR process the approval after three years is the same as the EDR process and the extension is the same as under except the CTPC suggested only allowing a one-year extension but since we just allowed a two-year for something I thought two years made more sense so allowed a two-year extension other than that it's pretty much copied from the guidebook and and that's where a lot of it came from and a lot of what's proposed to be discussed at the at the initial discussion came from a combination of what was in Claire's draft what is in the CTPC materials and what we're allowed to do in the site plan review. So that's it.

<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Stephen Revilak - 322</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, thank you. Let's start with Steve for comments. Okay, I have four comments. Three are clerical and one is substantive. So I'll start with the clerical ones. In 20.5, so what does the applicant propose to build on the site? Where will the buildings be located? What will the proposed buildings look like? I'd suggest adding the word and after the last comma. Okay, second clerical change is a suggestion in 20.B.7 there's an open parenthesis if affordable housing will be provided DDCD may require the applicant to be with and it just stops. It's you, Steve. I'm just kidding. Well, I was going to say it looks like the material is covered in the last paragraph of 20D so maybe maybe we don't need that part. 20.B.14 where does the applicant plan to put signs if any? I'd suggest a comma before if any. And now the substantive part. So 20D deals with lapse. So an approval granted under site plan review shall lapse after three years from its issuance if substantial use or construction is not commenced within the three-year period. Now the section the corresponding section we have for EDR which is 3.3.5.B has two additional aspects. One is excluding time required to pursue or await determination of an appeal and the second is adding an exception for good cause. So you couldn't start for three years but there was a good reason. So if I can read out loud I have a proposed amendment. Please. Okay. So an approval granted under site plan review shall lapse after three years from its issuance if substantial use or construction has not commenced within the three-year period comma except for good cause. New sentence. This three-year period shall not include time required to pursue or await the determination of a court appeal. Okay. And I just took that language out of the EDR section. Any concerns with that revision? No.</blockquote>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Eugene Benson - 331</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gene? No I think that that's a good change. Okay. So I think the only thing we would then do in the next sentence we would delete the phrase for good cause shown at the end because we put the good cause in the previous and I had moved it down there so we can delete so they'd say for a period not to exceed two years period. We don't need for good cause shown down there. Yeah I think those are good changes. Okay nothing further. Great. Thank you Steve. Shana? So recognizing that much of this follows EDR I did I did have some concerns first about timelines in day one I think 65 days to start the hearing and then again D2 and D3 these are really long time periods. 65 days and 90 days for continuance and then another 90 days after closure for final action. So again recognizing that this that this is in line with other regs. This is this is I wonder if these time frames are potentially onerous. So that was one. One of my thoughts and and the other non-administrative thought because Steve you were incredibly good at picking up picking up the administrative changes. So my other administrative thought was was essentially to the nature of site plan review. I'm a little concerned that that for projects that are of right we're reviewing we're doing really robust review and I know we talked a little bit about this last time and let it lie but some of these things are sort of obvious that they ought to be reviewed right. Health and safety and things relating to health and safety and traffic and things like that but more discretionary items like landscaping or design I get concerned I get concerned about the extent to which we yeah we have discretionary review over over proposals that are of right and how is that is there a point to be limited or advisory?</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 ? - 272</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Thank you. I have just a couple items. One is related to in section A where you define how site plan review will be where it will be applied. Knowing that we may want to use site plan review more robustly in the future is this hemmed in too much specifically with referring to it for parcels located within a multifamily housing overlay district or should we identify on parcels you know in locations as or in in districts or etc as identified in the zoning bylaws? Or process that requires site plan review. Or process that right so I guess my question is are we hemming this in too much only to need to potentially revise this in the future? Just a general question for us to consider. I also wanted to see if we wanted to require any documentation for the bonus height provisions or if we felt that that was adequately covered in the zoning bylaw. There are very specific requirements and we do say that those are subject to review by the redevelopment board so I want to make sure we own that someplace in the documentation. And to the point around design I was actually really pleased to see that we included design review because when we decided to support the MBTA communities provision I know that I did so with the caveat that design review would absolutely be required. I think that this board made the commitment to the town that we would ensure that what was being built was in alignment with the the the landscape of the town and the the existing vernacular.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah under section B I'm not sure is this implied or stated somewhere else but it asks for all these things one from 1 to 15 but in what form? Is it a handwritten note or is it a drawing? You know a good example is where the bicycle parking, where's pedestrian walk on the site? I mean we should say something like drawings or something like that? So let me let me sort of respond to a few things. One was if you'll notice the next thing it says after B is site plan review application required. We have not written that application. My thought was the application is where all those things will be required similar to what we do with the EDR application. So it would be narrative or seat drawing? Right so the missing piece that needs to be done is to do what the application is going to look like because that's where it would say you must include these documents. Yeah I'm fine. Right so we just haven't done that. Okay that's what I looked at this afternoon.</blockquote>

</details>

<details>
<summary>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	 Rachel Zsembery - 934</summary>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well yeah so you know because and you know Claire and I discussed this when I came into her office last week to discuss this in that I thought it was better to have that all in the application than in here because if we use the application for a while and decide we want to make changes in it we can do it we don't have to go out for public hearing all those other sorts of things like we would have to do with the with the rules and regulations so I thought the application was the place to to put all of those things. Okay could I just ask for a footnote in that if we ask if a 3d model is required it would be submitted to us for us to use in our model? Let's put that in the application Claire. If one is required. I'm not saying you have to do a 3d model for every little project. I said if one is required for explaining this let's have it. Before we get to some of the other comments I did forget to mention one thing and that is I wrote that a majority vote of the five members is required so rather than the super majority that's required for some special permits this would just be a simple majority three out of five that's required for site plan review. On Shana's question about the timing I don't know how much we can tighten the timing because this requires the same sort of notifications that go out at the time so they have to be in the newspaper and then there has to be a notification so I'm not sure how much those things can be tightened up. Claire may have an idea about whether we can or should tighten them up very much without sort of just falling over the deadlines too soon. So that's why I copied this from the EDR because it works. Well and recognizing of course that this mirrors exists it right it mirrors the EDR so so it may simply make sense to have it mirror existing procedure you know the 35 days for the board for all the departments to comment that makes a lot of sense to me and then the other the other periods seem to some of them be longer than I've seen in other municipalities but but again if that's what's in EDR it may open a it may be a much larger discussion than we're prepared to have here. And easier for the staff I think to be on the same time schedule. And what were the other ones? Rachel you had mentioned something. Yes I had a question around whether or not we hemmed ourself in too much by referring to multifamily or if we should again identify that this applies as we're identified in the zoning bylaw as opposed to being specific to multifamily districts. Well you know the thing about the previous paragraph single sentence above it the redevelopment board shall review a site plan in accordance with section 5.9.3 that's also. Right there are a couple places. There are a couple places there so I don't know if we're hemming ourselves in or if we just amend these if there's another section that comes through. Right I guess my thought was trying not to have both point back at each other if this one already points to site plan review can we strike both of those is the question and still. I think we can. Okay. Yeah I think I think I just put something in you know redevelopment board shall review a site plan in accordance with the zoning bylaw. Great. And then we can leave out the next paragraph. Perfect and then there was another question around whether or not we need to include anything in here around required documentation for the bonus height provisions. We would put that in the application. Application. Okay. Application is going to carry a lot of stuff. Perfect. One comment I have is that yes I think when we apply site plan review to you know the MBTA communities, the neighborhood multifamily, etc, that it is indeed you know the simple majority vote but if we are going to if we want a site plan review on other forms of development or whatever it may not be we might have to have a super majority vote. For example if we were going to do two families. If indeed that Warren article progressed and it was a review of two families does that become? Well that would be our choice whether we want it to be a simple majority or that because if it's a special permit we don't need to worry about this right but if it's site plan review then we get to decide if it's three or four. I think that what I understand how we're planning on using the site plan review going forward is that these are for as of right into Shana's point trying to pull back some of the barrier which is which is where three makes sense to me and again I would say the same for again if two and three family goes forward for example if they decide to move forward with that and we decide that site plan review is something that we want to talk to them about as a part of the process. Pulling back on the requirement may be part of what's desired I mean I think that's up for discussion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay did you have other comments? No. That's good. Any other comments or discussion? Thank you for doing this Mr. Benson. You're welcome Mr. Warren. I think next time we're going to preview the other change to the rules and regulations which we had talked about a few weeks ago to give the staff more discretion to approve signs so that's and I think it's going to be on the agenda for next time so hopefully we'll go out for public hearing on both of the changes to the rules and regs at the same time. fabulous thank you so much and so we'll make we'll make changes to this great all right anything else on yes one thing we didn't discuss yes the site plan review pre-application meeting required do we want to have it optional for very small let's say three and four unit buildings what so or is it neighborhood versus Mass Ave again well you could have a big project in the neighborhood if you combine multiple parcels or end up with a big parcel that's why I was thinking making it mandatory on Mass Ave and Broadway but optional on the side streets for smaller projects but then we're getting back into it didn't want us to right you're absolutely right which is putting in something related specifically to that Claire what's your I'm wondering if we do it for anything over four units mandatory mandatory or we could even mirror what very different so I yeah I think mandatory for anything over four units is probably the way to go so we'll make it optional for four or fewer units okay anything else</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great thank you very much so the board asked at our meeting with the developer the board had asked the developer to provide a rendering that would show updated facade of 882 Mass Ave. I did find that rendering I actually asked the developer to send and this is what was provided here you can see the white exits that we were concerned about painted out they did looks like fuzz over these the exhaust exhausts are still there still there okay looking looking is not pertuberant as they were before yes the I can give you an update that the architect is looking for or has identified an alternate product related to the vents or to change the vents out but I have not received any material yet it shows update you know we changed the so driving by it looks like they've started painting and just stopped halfway it made a lot of sense because painting that was not gonna work I wish they hadn't even started instead of seeing halfway right that's something else yes yes I can't tell from this rendering they gave you okay that they did what I wanted they did they didn't they didn't change they didn't turn the corner with the lighter material right here right yeah they didn't these I don't know what it's still shown as as dark I mean and can I add to that the white area below the cornice the midpoint cornice that looks terrible that needs to be the don't you can do you think that needs to be the same color as the panel I mean the whole point of a cornice is you're denoting the yes it looks exactly so that that needs to change to the same it needs to be the same color as what's below I just need to go back and look at and see what we approved was this dark I think this was dark I think it was and then this over here is what dark so the sort of band carry all the way across yeah and then right here at this edge right here what turns the corner that that color needs to turn this yep and then this side here but they didn't do it on this side here I don't know if the architect I truly did this it would have been a model I haven't give me the model so I can spin it okay what they give it to me like this I can't you know they just gave a certain view which I can't you know it's probably the best view and hides everything so is this what it what it looks like is a photo that they've that they touched up not a render is that what this is this is the photo of the building that they which is they didn't use the architect they took the photograph themselves and then through color in you know and did they submit the any samples for the vets are they going to or yes okay and then the only thing we wanted was for them to submit the spec for the painted and reused on the storefront and they're aware of that as well giving me the spec yet for the paint but they did you know me and let me know that they it's gonna be a metallic paint right the card art paint I don't want something says like you know Benjamin Moore white it's a special finish that adheres to metal as opposed to don't say that because to have the architect submit the proper paint for that I don't want to be the Arctic say tell them which brand to use that to brand that we just quoted so yeah and then we're responsible for paint coming off and I don't want to be the one saying that</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can we talk about the affordable housing which you raised last time too so I've gotten some emails from a concerned citizen who tells me that the look the smaller sized apartments have not been approved the inventory so can we find out what the status I do have a bit of an update on that and that is that it's my understanding that the concerned citizen did reach out to DHC the OHLC to about those units and at the time the OHLC did not have the regulatory agreement that was worked out with the town and with DHC at the time we just received back the regulatory agreement from the OHLC signed or to be signed? to be signed by the town and resubmitted to the OHLC for acceptance so they are I guess a little behind I think where the town is or where the town manager is in terms of his understanding of the agreement but the papers are going back and forth and to get signature and I think that the OHLC is just not yet updated on that agreement great and and does the agreement reflect the units as built or the units as does this you know they're the 500 and whatever square foot units in the particular location they actually exist does the regulatory agreement contemplate what we actually have sitting in this building yes yes of course it sort of seems to me that if there are no 700 square foot units and that was the issue affordable units shouldn't be the smaller units they should be the larger close to the 700 square feet. I don't know which ones they've chosen in the building I think they were the largest right they're the medium but he had that identified in the documentation that he gave to us last week or two weeks ago yeah and they were the average size units if I remember correctly. There are different ways to do it to make it comparable my approach would my preferred approach would be to spread it out different sizes to make it to make it representative but putting it as an average is fine. okay I won't push it then. I defer to the affordable housing expert on the board.
