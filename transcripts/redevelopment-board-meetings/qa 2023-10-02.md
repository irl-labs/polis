<details><summary>Please, summarize the Redevelopment Board meeting.</summary>

> The Redevelopment Board meeting on October 2nd, 2023, focused on reviewing meeting minutes and discussing the Warren Articles for Fall 2023 Special Town Meeting. The board deliberated on the MBTA Communities Overlay District, discussing various scenarios and alternatives for the district. They also discussed changes to the zoning bylaws, including height and story minimums, street trees requirements, and parking requirements. The board voted to recommend favorable action on several articles. They also discussed their meeting schedule and agreed to meet on October 23rd, prior to the town meeting. The board also expressed appreciation for the work of the MBTA Communities Working Group and the public's input.

> Claire Ricker, the director of the Department of Planning and Community Development, presented nine different scenarios and two alternatives for the MBTA Communities Overlay District. These scenarios were related to maximum height and parking requirements, and the alternatives proposed changes to the overall shape of the district. The alternatives included changes to the Arlington Heights and East Arlington areas. The scenarios included changes to the neighborhood multifamily zone's maximum height, minimum parking requirements, and the exclusion of certain areas from the overlay. Claire also discussed the need to address issues related to signs, as the current sign by-law only applies to either business or residential districts.

</details><details><summary>Summarize the discussion about the interaction of the proposed overlay district and existing zoning.</summary>

> The discussion revolved around the interpretation of the proposed overlay district and how it interacts with existing zoning. Some members of the group, including Gene, interpreted the overlay as replacing the underlying residential and business districts, meaning that if a developer chooses to comply with the overlay, they don't have to comply with the rules of the underlying districts. However, others, including Rachel and Steve, interpreted the overlay as being superimposed over the existing districts, meaning that where the overlay is silent, the standards currently in the bylaws would still apply. The group agreed that this ambiguity needs to be clarified in the wording of the overlay. They also discussed specific elements such as height restrictions, stepbacks, and commercial uses, and how these should be addressed in the overlay.
</details><details><summary>Summarize the parking requirements and in two separate paragraphs the arguments in support and against the parking requirements.</summary>

> Parking Requirements:
The parking requirements discussed involve a minimum of one parking space per unit in a development. This requirement is based on the current off-street parking requirements of section 6.1, including the provision that developments are encouraged to provide fewer parking spaces under the provisions of section 6.1.5. The last sentence in section F1 eliminates an off-street parking requirement for non-residential spaces, which typically applies when the business is under 3,000 square feet.

Arguments in Support:
Supporters of the parking requirements argue that they are necessary to accommodate the needs of residents who own cars. They point to data showing that the average number of vehicles per household in the area is around one, suggesting that one parking space per unit is appropriate. They also note that there is no overnight parking in the area, which compounds the need for off-street parking. Supporters also argue that the requirements are flexible, allowing for reductions based on a transportation demand management plan.

Arguments Against:
Critics of the parking requirements argue that they are a burden on developers and discourage the development of housing. They suggest that developers should be given the flexibility to build the number of parking spaces that they believe are necessary to sell units. Critics also argue that the requirements contradict environmental goals, as they encourage car use and contribute to traffic. They propose reducing the minimum requirement to half a space per unit, or even eliminating it altogether.
</details><details><summary>Summarize the height restrictions and the bonus for builders for more housing units.  What was the concensus for building heights?</summary>

> The consensus for building heights was to reduce the maximum height from four to three stories in the neighborhood multifamily requirements. However, there was a suggestion to introduce a bonus for builders who add more affordable housing units, potentially allowing them to add an extra story, making it a four-story building. This suggestion was not agreed upon during the discussion.
</details><details><summary>Summarize the three different parts (East Arlington, Orvis Road, the Heights) of the overlay districts and the parcels included in each.</summary>

> In East Arlington, the overlay district extends approximately 150 feet from the main thoroughfares on Mass Ave and Broadway, allowing for a one-to-two parcel transitional height area of four stories into the R1 and R2 districts. This area avoids all commercial and industrial parcels and maintains the neighborhood multifamily zone.

At Orvis Road, there are two scenarios. Scenario 3A removes all the parcels on Mass Ave east of Orvis Road while keeping the neighborhood multifamily zone with a maximum height of four stories. This results in a district area of about 113 acres with a capacity of 7,137 units at a density of roughly 64 units per acre. Scenario 3B eliminates all proposed overlay parcels east of Orvis Road along Mass Ave., including the neighborhood multifamily area. This results in a district area of about 104 acres with a capacity of 6,570 units at a density of 64.1 units per acre.

In the Heights, the overlay district extends to the north of Mass Ave, including Grove Street and the Forest Clark Pierce Street area. The overall depth of the neighborhood multifamily district from the center line of Mass Ave is 350 feet. The district area is approximately 115 acres with a capacity for 7,391 units at a density of 65 dwelling units per acre.
</details><details><summary>What environmental and climate concerns were discussed by the baord?</summary>

> The board discussed adding a purpose statement to encourage environmental and climate protection sensitive development. They also discussed changing the site certifiable to sites gold or better certified or other standard the ARB may adopt in its rules and regulations. Additionally, they discussed including solar roof requirements for the Massachusetts Avenue and Broadway Multifamily District.
</details><details><summary>Please, summarize the solar roof requirement.</summary>

> The solar roof requirement is proposed to be included in the development standards for the Massachusetts Avenue and Broadway Multifamily District. This would make these projects subject to the Zoning By-law Section 6.4, which currently applies to projects requiring environmental design review. The requirement would not apply to the Neighborhood Multifamily District. The exact placement of this requirement within the bylaw is still under discussion, with suggestions including adding it as a separate section or folding it into the development standards.
