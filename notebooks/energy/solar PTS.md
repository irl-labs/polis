## Massachusetts RPS / PTS

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides data on all of the renewable energy generation facilites, including both commercial and residential, through its website [Lists of Qualified Generation Units](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/lists-of-qualified-generation-units) and directs the user to 7 different programs, see list below.

* [RPS 1](https://www.mass.gov/doc/eligible-class-i-renewable-generation-units-0)
* [SREC I](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/27/Solar%20Carve-Out%20Qualified%20Units%20080717_0.xlsx)
* [SREC II](https://www.mass.gov/doc/solar-carve-out-ii-qualified-renewable-generation-units)
* [SMART](https://www.mass.gov/doc/smart-qualified-units-list)
* [CLASS 2](https://www.mass.gov/doc/rps-class-ii-qualified-units-list-2/download)
* [WASTE](https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2017/10/27/eligible-class2-waste-units.xls)
* [APS](https://www.mass.gov/doc/aps-qualified-units-list-6)

Verification of monthly production data is centralized through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center - [Production Tracking System](https://www.masscec.com/about-pts).  PTS data is lagged about 18 months in 2023.  The overlap with the individual *Lists of Qualified Generation Units* is high but with differing data items; see detail and a column naming normalization below.  The [monthly production data](http://files.masscec.com/innovate-clean-energy/prod-track-system/PTSSRECCapacityReport.xlsx) for a large fraction of all systems is available for the years 2010 - 2016 and shows an average 13.71% "capacity"; the proportion of stated kW capacity actually produced.

### Issues

* no unique key
* no (lat,lon) coordinates / location indeterminate
