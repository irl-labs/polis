# [Berkeley Labs - Tracking the Sun](https://emp.lbl.gov/tracking-the-sun)

Berkeley Labâ€™s annual Tracking the Sun report describes trends among grid-connected, distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the United States. The latest edition of the report focuses on systems installed through year-end 2021, and is based on data from roughly 2.5 million systems. New to the report this year is an expanded coverage of paired PV-plus-storage systems, including details on system design and pricing trends.

Sources for MA are the same as the [Production Tracking System](https://www.masscec-pts.com/#/home) with many additional metrics; for examples:

* Up to 3 module and inverter manufacturer, model and panel quantity details
* number of panels and panel nameplate capacity
* technology details; BIVP, bifacial, efficiencies
* orientation; azimuth, tilt
* battery installations
* unique system identifier
* ~80 columns vs 6 for PTS
