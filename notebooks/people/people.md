## [MA Secretary of State - Elections Division](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/divisions/elections/elections-and-voting.htm)

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts maintains a legacy database (1995)  that cities and towns use to upload details about the residents and request extracts for elections and town records purposes.

Below are the three types of extracts we turned into datasets.  From 2004 to 2023, there were about 110 different extracts providing snapshots of some 3.5M records.  As is apparent, the legacy system is suboptimal and a replacement is being planned.

Histograms are pre-calculated; see the ```histograms.ipynb``` notebook.

A. People schema contains 6 tables

    1. attributes ~90K rows
    ```CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS people.attributes
            (

                name character varying(50)[] COLLATE pg_catalog."default",
