### [Mass Registry of Deeds](https://www.masslandrecords.com/)

Massachusetts is divided into 21 registry districts with an elected Register of Deeds responsible for each office. Documents related to the ownership of real estate within the district are recorded at the Registry of Deeds. Recorded documents are assigned a sequential identifying number (known as the book and page number) and are then scanned into the registry's computer system. The resulting images are available for viewing on and printing from public access terminals at the registry and at your home or office over the Internet.
